  There's not much that hasn't changed in Australian football.

The players have evolved, the equipment has been modernised and the rules are constantly being altered.

But one thing that's never been updated is the ball.

That could all be about to change.

For the first time in 137 years, Sherrin has deviated from its original design in order to build a skill-based ball, to help all ages and abilities fine-tune their kicking.

It's called the Sherrin Precision and if Mark "Choco'' Williams has his way it could eventually replace the current game ball.

"I'm not sure as time goes on why this can't be the normal football," Williams explained to Fairfax Media, as he kicked one of his new Sherrins to Richmond star, close friend and protege Dustin Martin.

"We replaced small-headed racquets [in tennis], they're all gone. [Thinner] cricket bats and golf clubs, no one uses them any more. But at the time everyone thought they were crazy."

Williams is a visionary.

He etched himself into AFL history when he led Port Adelaide to their first premiership in 2004.

He may just have changed the game again.

Built with large points on either end of the ball, the design increases the size of the impact zone for the kicker's boot, while the painted yellow line provides guidance for the correct spin a drop punt should have.

"It's more forgiving, that's the idea of it," Williams said.

"You get more success, so you'll kick more and you'll think; 'yeah, I can do this!'

"Golf clubs, went from little to big, cricket bats … same thing."

"Everyone laughed at those sports when they started – and I'm saying this is not just for little kids.

"This is for adults, elite players. This is for goal-kickers, for people who miss passes."

The ball is likely to be introduced into the Auskick program soon and will be made available to all senior football leagues, including the AFL.

"People like Levi Casboult and set shots for goal – this would be fantastic for him."

The Precision has been a concept Williams started working on with his son Isaac as part of a school project, more than eight years ago.

"I originally wanted to call it the 'i-ball," he chuckled.

Since then, it's gone through a plethora of testing with a range of different footballers, including one of the game's best in Martin.

"Choc brought it in last year for a bit of a trial and there was a group of us who got out on the oval and had a bit of a kick with it and a play around," Martin said.

"He does have a few crazy ideas," Martin said as he smiled at Williams.

"But I certainly think this one is going to be very good for people wanting to improve their kicking."

Like Williams, Martin is pushing for the new ball to eventually replace the current design, such is his delight with the fresh concept.

"Hopefully, yeah. It's great. It's good to improve the kicking."

It's no secret that Williams and Martin have shared a close bond since their time together at Punt Road.

While Martin refused to talk about his playing future at the Tigers, he was willing to open up on his relationship with his mentor.

"Choc came to the club probably three or four years ago, we just had a close relationship and we still do.

"I still see his family probably most weeks for dinner or just to catch up, I'm sure he'll put on something nice for me tonight after this."

Although Williams has left Richmond in an official capacity, he still plays a significant role in Martin's life.

They see each other each week after Tigers games, where they sit and analyse Martin's games while watching replays.

"Coming third in the Brownlow and making the All-Australian team and winning the best and fairest … I couldn't be more proud of Dustin," Williams said.

On top of the Precision, Sherrin will on Wednesday launch a second football; the Griptech.

Built with the help of Professor Kevin Ball, the Griptech is specifically designed for boys and girls who will transition through different skill sets.

The three stages start with the easiest material to grip and end with what's known as the "transition grip", which is likened to a basketball and helps children move from synthetic into leather footballs at a more senior level.</p>
