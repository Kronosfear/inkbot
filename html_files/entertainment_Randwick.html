  "It is one of those things where anything can happen - a bit hit-and-miss - but certainly I think there will be a little bit of rain on Thursday afternoon which might push up back maybe slightly into the Heavy or maybe the worst side of the Soft.
The past two feature Saturdays at Rosehill have been conducted on Heavy 10 and Heavy 9 surfaces respectively following continual rain in Sydney, but Ramdhani said on Tuesday the Randwick course had enjoyed a few days of drying conditions.
"I'd rate the track a Soft 7 this morning," Ramdhani said.
“No construction that directly impacts access to Royal Randwick Racecourse will take place during the 2017 Autumn Carnival,” the project’s co-ordinator general Marg Prendergast said.
The opening day of The Championships on Saturday may not be conducted on a Heavy surface, with Randwick track manager Nevesh Ramdhani predicting no worse than Soft conditions.
"MORE than 22,000 people are expected to descend upon Randwick this Saturday when the Sydney Autumn Carnival gallops onto the royal racecourse.
“Last year Royal Randwick drew a great crowd and I look forward to again being part of the action following a day of world class racing,” Keating said.
Ramdhani said he was delighted with how the Randwick track had coped with the continual downpours with a view to three huge Saturdays of racing.
