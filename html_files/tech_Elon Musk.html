It is unclear what sorts of products Neuralink might create, but people who have had discussions with the company describe a strategy similar to space launch company SpaceX and Tesla.
The company, called Neuralink Corp, is pursuing what Musk calls the "neural lace" technology, implanting a digital layer of tiny brain electrodes above the cortex that may one day upload and download thoughts, the Wall Street Journal reported.
Internal sources tell the WSJ that the company, called Neuralink, is developing "neural lace" technology that would allow people to communicate directly with machines without going through a physical interface.
He said the "neural lace" could prevent people from becoming "house cats" to artificial intelligence.
