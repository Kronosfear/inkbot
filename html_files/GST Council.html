  The panel, which had at its last meeting approved the final draft of central (C-GST) and integrated (I-GST) laws, will from Thursday take up for approval the state and Union Territory (UT-GST) laws, official sources said.Once approved, the supporting legislations together with a Compensation Law, will go to the Cabinet for a formal nod before they are presented in in the ongoing Budget session that ends on April 12.The is hoping the C-GST, the I-GST, the UT- and the Compensation laws will be approved in the current session of and the S- by each of the state legislatures soon to help roll out the new indirect regime from July 1.The Council may also be given an update on technology preparedness and migration of assessees to the new regime.Migration of all the 85 lakh central and state taxpayers is planned to be completed by March 31.So far, over 51 lakh have migrated to the new system.Sources said the Council has already finalised a four- tier structure of 5, 12, 18 and 28 per cent, but the model has kept the peak rate at 40 per cent (20 per cent to be levied by the Centre and an equal amount by states) to obviate the need for approaching for any change in rates in future.On similar lines, the Council is also likely to decide on a cap rate for cess to be levied at the peak rate of to create the compensation corpus.Sources said any approved by cannot have open-ended rates and therefore a cap or peak rate will have to be mentioned.For the levy of GST, the peak rate has been put at 40 per cent and a similar cap will also have to be approved for the cess.While the C- will give powers to the Centre to levy on goods and services after Union levies like excise and service are subsumed, the I- is to be levied on inter-state supplies.The S-GST, which will allow states to levy the after VAT and other state levies are subsumed in the GST, will have to be passed by each state Assembly.
The UT- will also go to for approval.Sources said the model will have a clause to enable levy of up to 40 per cent tax, but the effective rates will be kept at the previously approved levels.This will also help in a scenario where the cess on demerit goods being proposed to compensate states for loss of from is to be merged with the rate itself.
The cess would be used to compensate states for any loss in revenue because of the The cap on cess on any other items notified later would be used only if more compensation is needed; so, in a way, this was also a leeway.
The Goods and Services Tax (GST) Council on Thursday cleared a proposal to cap the cess on luxury cars and aerated drinks at 15 per cent over the peak rate of 28 per cent.
The official said if it was found the compensation amount was higher than anticipated by the government, then the rate on an item could be reduced to, say, 26 per cent and cess increased to 14 per cent, so that the aggregate rate remained equal to the current rate (40 per cent).
