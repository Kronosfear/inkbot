  A second-half goal from Juan Mata was enough to seal victory on the night, though considering Rostov started in a losing position thanks to Henrikh Mkhitaryan’s away goal in the first leg it was surprising that they made so little attempt to chase the game.
The home side had the first chance in less than five minutes, a Marcos Rojo header bringing a save from Nikita Medvedev after Daley Blind’s corner, before Zlatan Ibrahimovic was presented with an opportunity through Mata’s quick-thinking after Khoren Bayramyan had given the ball away.
The hosts quickly built on their away goal when Vincent Aboubakar – Besiktas’ scorer in Athens – netted again to put his side ahead in the tie after only 10 minutes.
While United were still in a comfortable position thanks to their away goal Rostov managed to show a signs of intent early in the second half with shots on target from Sardar Azmoun and Christian Noboa, both comfortably dealt with by Sergio Romero.
Possibly spurred on by the thought of how embarrassing it would be to concede a goal and lose the tie to a side as unadventurous as Rostov, United finally got their act together sufficiently to take the lead just after midway through the second half.
