  Carolina Panthers quarterback Cam Newton will undergo surgery on his throwing shoulder next Thursday that will keep him out through organized team activities , the team announced Tuesday.
“We developed a plan for Cam to take a period of rest, a period of rehabilitation and treatment, and then start a gradual throwing program the first part of March,” Panthers head athletic trainer Ryan Vermillion told the team's official website.
(CHARLOTTE, N.C.) — Carolina Panthers quarterback Cam Newton will undergo surgery to repair a partially torn rotator cuff in his right throwing shoulder according to ESPN.
However, as we worked to advance him into the next stage – the strengthening stage, the throwing stage – he started to have an increase in his pain level and started having pain while throwing.
Newton is expected to miss organized team activities (OTAs) earlier in the summer, but is expected to be ready for training camp in late July.
