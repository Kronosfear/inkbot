  “We developed a plan for Cam to take a period of rest, a period of rehabilitation and treatment, and then start a gradual throwing program the first part of March,” Vermillion said.
However, as we worked to advance him into the next stage – the strengthening stage, the throwing stage – he started to have an increase in his pain level and started having pain while throwing.
“As a result of the MRI, we modified all of Cam’s work in the weight room and on the field for the final three weeks of the season.”

Newton did not miss any snaps in the remaining three games, and after the season concluded, a number of MRIs were performed to monitor his progress.
Our goal is to have him back at the start of training camp.”

Johnson, who is entering his 11th season, alerted the athletic training staff of back pain recently, which ultimately led to surgery at Carolinas Medical Center on March 21.
CHARLOTTE – Quarterback Cam Newton (shoulder), defensive end Charles Johnson (back) and wide receiver Damiere Byrd (knee) are undergoing surgical procedures that will sideline them during the Panthers’ offseason practice program.
