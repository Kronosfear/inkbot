  Gerry Rogers, MHA for St. John's Centre, will introduce a private member's bill on Wednesday, pushing for pay equity for women in Newfoundland and Labrador.

It's a complex issue, Rogers told the St. John's Morning Show, but one the government should be willing to tackle head on, especially on International Women's Day.

"It's a human rights issue," she said.

"Are we satisfied as a community to base our income on the unfair payment of labour for women? Are we satisfied to do that? It's no longer acceptable."

Rogers' motion will be seconded by her fellow party member Lorraine Michael, and they hope it will be voted along by all members of the House of Assembly.

According to Statistics Canada 2014 numbers, Alberta and Newfoundland and Labrador were the worst provinces in Canada when it came to a gender wage gap.

On average, women in Newfoundland and Labrador earned 66 per cent of what men made.

The gap is influenced by many factors, such as higher numbers of women occupying low-paying jobs and a lower number of women holding leadership positions within traditionally male-dominated fields.

In Canada, women earn about 72 per cent of what men make in similar fields of work.

The goal of pay equity is no strange concept to the province. In the 1980s, then-premier Brian Peckford committed to develop a pay equity plan to compensate underpaid female workers in public-sector jobs.

Happy IWD to all women. Will second @GerryRogersMHA motion in the House of Assembly this aft asking Gov't to start pay equity process. 1/2 — @lorrainemichael

By 1991, the provincial government backed off, cancelling pay equity settlements for 20,000 health-care workers — a field in which 80 per cent of the workforce were women.

In 2004, the Supreme Court of Canada upheld the government's decision to ditch the payments.

Two years later, the Danny Williams government voluntarily paid the $24 million that was taken off the table in 1991.

Now, Rogers hopes the government will stand up for pay equity by starting the legislation process.

"How would they be able to go back to their communities, to their constituents and justify why they wouldn't support women being treated fairly in the workplace?" she said. "It's kind of a no-brainer."</p>
