  Wanderers scrapped for a narrow win at Sixfields back in November, courtesy of a Zach Clough strike and Le Fondre – who has filled the goalscorer’s mantle since the youngster left for Nottingham Forest in January – is prepared to roll up his sleeves once again.
“They love me and I have to give everything I can to try and repay that, getting this great club back up to where it belongs.”

Northampton arrive tomorrow in a decent run of form, beating Charlton, AFC Wimbledon and Port Vale in their last three games.
Therefore, it’s a credit to the character of Phil Parkinson’s side, who were only saved from administration in November, that they have now clawed their way back up to second place, a point above Fleetwood Town with a game in hand thanks to three successive wins including a 4-2 thrashing of the Cod Army at Highbury.
“On a personal level a lot of us are out of contract, so we have something to prove on that front as well.”

Le Fondre speaks from experience, having sat miserably on the bench for most of the last 18 months at Wolves and Wigan Athletic.
When Bolton Wanderers were forced to bid farewell to talismanic forward Zach Clough in January, their promotion hopes appeared to disappear with him.
