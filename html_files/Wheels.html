  A proposal of the Trump budget , released Thursday morning, calls for the complete elimination of the Community Development Block Grant program, which operates under the Department of Housing and Urban Development and covers Meals on Wheels.
Meals on Wheels is one of the longest running programs in the Community Development Block Grant program, according to its website , and it served over 219 million meals to 2.4 million homebound senior citizens in 2016.
The relevant Department of Housing and Urban Development section of the budget contains the following language:

Eliminates funding for the Community Development Block Grant program, a savings of $3 billion from the 2017 annualized CR level.
"The Federal Government has spent over $150 billion on this block grant since its inception in 1974, but the program is not well-targeted to the poorest populations and has not demonstrated results," the draft of the budget says.
The Community Development Block Grant program was established in 1974 and provides grants to state and local governments that provide assistance like Meals on Wheels, affordable housing services and natural disaster recovery in low income neighborhoods.
