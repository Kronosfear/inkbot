  Sluggish business investment in Canada

The disappointing performance of business investment to date could reflect more sustained structural factors, such as slowing labour force growth, low productivity growth and regulatory obstacles.
But he noted particular concern about business investment, which represents about 12 per cent of Canadian GDP, saying the bank tracks it very closely as an economic bellwether that signals confidence in demand and drives the business cycle.
Second, fluctuations in business investment can drive the business cycle—roughly 50 per cent of the movements in quarterly GDP during the Great Recession and its aftermath were due to shifts in business investment.
He said stronger U.S. growth and higher commodity prices were the key upside risks to the inflation outlook, saying they could improve Canada's terms of trade and business investment.Introduction

Stronger GDP growth in the United States

The ongoing US recovery, the new US administration’s decision to restart the approval process for the Keystone XL pipeline and other energy projects, and further policy measures, including tax reform, deregulation and infrastructure spending, could boost both demand and business confidence, igniting animal spirits and leading to an acceleration in the rates of investment, firm creation and innovation.
