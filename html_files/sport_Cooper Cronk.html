Foran starred in his Warriors debut in Sunday's 28-22 morale-boosting win over the Titans but his time in Auckland might be short-lived if he chose to return to Australia to be closer to his two young children
“I get on a plane every other spare minute in Melbourne (to see Rushton) and it’s getting harder to get back on that plane to come back so in the best interest of this football club it’s the right decision at the right time”

Johnson joked he would go wherever his good friend and new Warriors halves partner Kieran Foran - who is also off-contract - decided to go beyond this season
Johnson has been in talks with the Warriors since late last year about extending his time at the club and although an agreement has not yet been reached he brushed aside talk he could sign with last year's grand finalists
Cronk's shock announcement yesterday that he will leave Melbourne and move to Sydney at the end of the season sparked discussions about potential candidates to fill his purple No7 jersey and the flow-on effects his move could have on other clubs and off-contract halves
The light-hearted talk continued when Johnson remarked his future at the Warriors could be settled quickly if Foran also committed to stay at the club
