  "Militant unions have used bullying and standover tactics to trash the rule of law on work sites, and now one of Australia's most senior union bosses says the law should only apply when you agree with it," Mr Turnbull told News Corp.

Greens employment spokesman Adam Bandt said many employees were being punished for seeking to advance their rights at work

"Of course, we can't all just pick and choose which laws we want to follow, but our labour laws breach international law and you can't condemn people who get punished under them," he said.
"Working people only take these measures when the issue is one of justice, like ensuring workers' safety on work sites, a fair day's pay for a fair day's work, or to uphold and improve rights for working people," she said in a statement, adding there was "rampant lawlessness" in the workplaces of Australia.

ACTU boss Sally McManus has refused to back down from her now-infamous comments backing workers' rights to break laws they view as unjust, saying Medicare and many working conditions had been won through "non-violent so-called illegal industrial action".
On Wednesday night Ms McManus told the ABC she believed "in the rule of law where the law's fair, where the law's right, but when it's unjust I don't think there's a problem with breaking it".
I want to change all of that and build a movement that everyone who feels the same can join.”Senior Turnbull government figures are rounding on controversial comments by new ACTU boss Sally McManus supporting workers rights to break laws they view as unjust.
