  It’s really fun to just know you’re going to be going into a game and knowing it’s just going to be two teams going at it.
Florida vs. Vanderbilt: Last five games

3/10/17: Vanderbilt 72, Florida 62 (OT)

3/4/17: Vanderbilt 73, Florida 71

1/21/17: Vanderbilt 68, Florida 66

2/23/16: Vanderbilt 87, Florida 74

1/26/16: Vanderbilt 60, Florida 59

So why do the Commodores continually come out on top in these close games?
The camera shots there included closeups of a distraught-seeming Fisher-Davis:

A further Vanderbilt foul after Northwestern inbounded led to Sanjay Lumpkin missing and then making a shot, boosting the Wildcats’ lead to 68-66. and then a Fisher-Davis long-range heave at the buzzer missing:

If that final Fisher-Davis shot had gone in, he’d probably be feeling a lot better about himself right now.
The Wildcats did well early on, leading 34-27 at the half and 49-34 with less than 14 minutes to go, but the Commodores mounted a ferocious comeback led by Matthew Fisher-Davis (who finished with a team-high 22 points despite coming off the bench), and they took a 66-65 lead with 17.8 seconds left on a Riley LaChance layup.
“I don’t think it’s like anything knowing you’re going to win, it’s knowing it’s going to come down to a fight.
