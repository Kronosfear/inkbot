  The irritating thing about Google Assistant is that it doesn't have a name, so whereas you can wake up Amazon's assistant by just saying "Alexa", with Google Home you have to say "OK Google" every time you want to talk to it.
Sound

Google Home boasts a "high-excursion driver" with a "dual passive radiator" design that Google claims delivers "crystal-clear highs and deep lows".
Meanwhile, Google Home boasts a "high-excursion driver" with a "dual passive radiator" design that Google claims delivers "crystal-clear highs and deep lows".
With the Echo, you can tap into Amazon's own music library and Prime Music offerings, while the Home links up with Google Play Music and YouTube Music.
Just like Amazon's successful Echo speaker, the Home can schedule appointments, set reminders and read out the news.
Voice assistant

Amazon's voice assistant Alexa is capable of understanding simple commands, or even a series of commands, but she can't conduct two-way conversations.
The speaker already boasts Uber, Skyscanner, National Rail, and JustEat among its "skills", as well as several smart home appliances such as Hive, Netatmo and Philips Hue.
Amazon Echo is a 1.0 channel speaker, meaning that it is a single speaker with one tweeter and one woofer.
