  The election to the three municipal corporations will be held on April 22, while counting will take place on April 25.After the high-steam civic polls in Mumbai last month, all eyes are now set on the elections to the three municipal corporations in the National Capital, which will be held on 22 April.
The State Election Commission has also increased the expenditure limit for a candidate from Rs 5 lakh to Rs 5.75 lakh, at a time when the Congress party is alleging that the BJP has hijacked the thrones of Manipur and Goa using "money power."
New Delhi: The BJP, which has been controlling all three civic bodies of Delhi for a decade, has decided to drop all sitting candidates this time -- electing to, as it says, bring in a "fresh team for the next 10 years".
Its chief opponents, Aam Aadmi Party leader Arvind Kejriwal and the Congress, have demanded that ballot papers be used during the election to keep out the possibility of rigging -- a plea the by Election Commission has turned down.
Important dates, facts and figures

The erstwhile unified Municipal Corporation of Delhi was trifurcated in 2012 — just ahead of the previous election — into North, South and East Municipal Corporation or NDMC, SDMC and EDMC respectively, which the BJP has been ruling since 2007.
