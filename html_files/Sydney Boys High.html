  The principal and deputy principal of southwest Sydney’s Punchbowl Boys High School have been removed following backlash against the exclusion of female staff from official events, the Australian reports.

Principal Chris Griffiths and deputy principal Joumama Dennaoiu were sacked yesterday following an investigation from the NSW Department of Education into a number of issues.

While the Department’s investigation found no official policy concerning the role of female teachers, the Australian reports female teachers were blocked from taking official roles at a Year 12 graduation ceremony and presentation day last year – with no explanation from management.

A spokesman from the Department said yesterday that the school had undergone a regular audit in 2016.

“As a result of a recent appraisal of Punchbowl Boys High School, there has been a change in the leadership of the school,” he said.

“A new principal and deputy principal will commence work at the school tomorrow.”

The new leadership team has not been named.

Mr Griffiths succeeded the role in late 2015 from Jihad Dib, now state Labor MP for Lakemba, who is credited with restoring the school’s reputation.

The Department’s unusual decisions come as more questions are raised over a new protocol at Hurstville Boys School in south Sydney that allows students to decline to shake hands with women.

The Australian reports such a measure could violate federal anti-discrimination laws, with state Education Minister Rob Stokes labelling it “sexist.”</p>
