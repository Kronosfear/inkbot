  AFL legend James Hird has broken his silence about his long battle with depression that led him to a psychiatric facility following a suspected drug overdose

The 44-year-old said he had reached his breaking point after 'years of continual stress'

The former Essendon coach (pictured with his wife Tania) was hospitalised early in January after a suspected drug overdose at his family home

The 44-year-old said he had reached his breaking point after enduring 'years of continual stress' before he finally sought help.
The embattled former Aussie Rules player stayed away from the media spotlight to recover at the psychiatric facility for five weeks (pictured early last month)

Hird, a highly decorated AFL player and Brownlow medallist who is widely considered to be one of the greatest players in the league's history, married his wife Tania in 1997

The Court of Arbitration for Sport announced in January 2016 that 34 current and former Essendon players used the banned substance Thymocin Beta 4, a peptide, during the 2012 season.
For confidential support, call the Lifeline 24-hour service on 13 11 14 or beyondblue 1300 22 4636.Former Essendon coach James Hird says he first contacted depression helpline beyondblue in 2015, but reached his breaking point in January "after years of continual stress".
My first call to beyondblue in 2015 was an admission I needed help but it took until January 4, 2017, when I took too many sleeping tablets, to truly accept that I could not dig myself out of this hole."
'My first call to beyondblue in 2015 was an admission I needed help but it took until January 4, 2017, when I took too many sleeping tablets, to truly accept that I could not dig myself out of this hole,' he wrote for the Herald Sun.
