  Appearing on the show to promote the announcement of the world's 50 best restaurants, Blumenthal was asked a simple question by Waleed Aly but gave the world's most confusing answer, with some viewers joking he might have been on "acid"

The Project's co-hosts and viewers were left scratching their heads last night during a bizarre interview with celebrity chef Heston Blumenthal
Me trying to understand Heston right now @theprojecttv pictwittercom/PL3i8ltwwF — Liam Flanagan (@ljflannas) April 3, 2017

@theprojecttv Heston's answer to Waleed's question was like a student desperately trying to use up excess word count on an essay</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" align="center"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Heston Blumenthal accepts the trophy for The <a href="https://twitter.com/DinersClub">@DinersClub</a> Lifetime Achievement Award! <a href="https://twitter.com/TheHestonTeam">@TheHestonTeam</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Worlds50Best?src=hash">#Worlds50Best</a> <a href="https://t.co/UoX7jEULGG">pic.twitter.com/UoX7jEULGG</a></p>&mdash; Kunal Kapur (@ChefKunalKapur) <a href="https://twitter.com/ChefKunalKapur/status/849587292423430145">April 5, 2017</a></blockquote>

But British chef Heston Blumenthal, whose restaurant The Fat Duck is a previous number one, while Dinner by Heston in London has also featured on the 50 best list, has joined a growing chorus of chefs who’ve criticised the term “best” to describe the list
The Project's resident smarty pants, Waleed Aly, interjected and said, "That explains why we like restaurants, but how do we tell the good ones from the bad ones?"
(Hang in there, it's almost over)

"There's a palliative care nurse that wrote a piece in The Guardian last year, the most common things, regrets people had while they were passing away and it was they wished they lived a life true to themselves," Blumenthal said
"If every human being had an ambition not to have that feeling, and that's because our new brain that came from eating cooked food  starts to fade and then our raw emotion comes through and we realise, actually, this is about emotion
