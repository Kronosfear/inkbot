  Alisson has been quite good this season in limited minutes, but Roma must be airtight in the back if they want to come out of this match with a win.
Fortunately, i Lupi stopped the bleeding (of points and of dignity) with a nice win over Palermo, where Roma’s bench proved itself to be deeper than once feared and Edin Džeko scored his thirtieth goal of the season.
Massara: 'Roma belive in comeback'

By Football Italia staff

Roma director Ricky Massara wants the fans to “hopefully push us towards a comeback that we firmly believe in” against Lyon.
If Roma pulls off a come-from-behind win, they still have a decent chance at European glory, and any season which adds a trophy to the cabinet is a good one for Roma fans.
Italian newspapers began to murmur that James Pallotta was losing faith in his manager, that players would flee the capital club like rats from a sinking ship once the summer window arrived and that it was really quite a shame that Francesco Totti’s last season was being ruined.
