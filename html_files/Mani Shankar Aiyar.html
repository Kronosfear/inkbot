  NEW DELHI: Amid growing calls for restructuring the Congress after its debacle in UP, senior leader Mani Shankar Aiyar today stressed on the need for forging a "grand alliance" as the party "cannot defeat BJP and Modi alone".Aiyar called for forging fresh alliances to take on the BJP and strengthening the party by bringing in young leaders.
We must approach a mahagathbhandan (grand alliance) to the extent possible," the former Union minister said.The grand alliance could then decide who its leader would be, he said, without clearly mentioning whether Rahul Gandhi should helm it or someone else.Aiyar also wrote a blog wherein he underscored the need for reviving the spirit of 2004 when the UPA I led by Congress, was backed by the Left Front, Samajwadi Party and Bahujan Samaj Party during various phases of its stint in power.
But it is not that people have voted for Modi in 2017 or even in 2014, as more than 69 per cent did not vote for Modi in 2014 and around 59 per cent have not voted for him in 2017 in Uttar Pradesh," he said.About Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi, he said he faced no challenge from within the party.
We will see to it that we will in 2019 give a formidable challenge to Prime Minister Narendra Modi under the leadership of Rahul Gandhi," he said.He said Congress will have tie-ups in every state "wherever we can give a challenge to Narendra Modi.
"At the AICC briefing, party general secretary C P Joshi said the entire political narrative changed after 2014 elections and posed new challenges to face which the party needed to align with other parties across the country to take on the BJP.He sought to defend Rahul Gandhi against criticism, saying he played a significant role in bringing together various parties in Bihar to BJP.
