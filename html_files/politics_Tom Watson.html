  Each of those toys comes with a guarantee, if a kids breaks the toy, "I will give you two to replace it," finished Tom

On top of all that Tom says toy making is something he plans to do until he can do it no longer
!CLYDE, Texas (KRBC) - His workshop doesn't have elves, and he doesn't answer to Claus or Cringle, but that hasn't stopped this Clyde resident from doing some fairly jolly work
"In the last two or three months I've made over 250 toys, by myself, just me," commented Tom Watson
These toys, however, aren't for sale, they're for local kids going through trying times</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" align="center"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/benedpugh">@benedpugh</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/TheProleStar">@TheProleStar</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/tedtully">@tedtully</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/tom_watson">@tom_watson</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/MomentumCV">@MomentumCV</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/craigmnet">@craigmnet</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/Tuckleton">@Tuckleton</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/PeterStefanovi2">@PeterStefanovi2</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/PeoplesMomentum">@PeoplesMomentum</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/penkymax">@penkymax</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/SocialistVoice">@SocialistVoice</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/armyofall">@armyofall</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/UKLabour">@UKLabour</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/jeremycorbyn">@jeremycorbyn</a> Tom Watson couldn&#39;t even bring himself to vote against Saudi Arabia bombing Yemen with our weapons.

"I'm not in this as a business, this is a hobby, it's a way for me to give back
