  Watch the video for Say You Won’t Let Go here:Pop star James Arthur took time to pose for snaps with thrilled fans after his packed out gig at Plymouth Pavilions last night.
Performed at the end of the set, Say You Won’t Let Go was the obvious highlight of the night, and everyone witnessed a very sweet moment where one of the concertgoers proposed to his girlfriend, which the singer-songwriter admitted made even him get choked up.
After his first single, a cover of Shontelle’s Impossible, shot to number one on the charts, his career took a downturn when his reputation was besmirched by accusations of homophobia and racism due to vitriolic lyrics in his 2013 diss track to Mickey Worthless, entitled Hey Mickey.

Dozens of those in love with talented James - who rose to fame after he won the ninth series of the X-Factor in 2012 - have posted up their moments with the star on social media.
At one point he accused those assembled jokily of coming only to hear Say You Won’t Let Go, but judging by the response to that song compared to the previous ones, that allegation seemed to hold some truth.
