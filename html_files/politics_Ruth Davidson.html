  First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said Scottish voters had the right to a choice on the country's future

Ms Davidson was speaking six days after Scotland's first minister announced she wished to hold another independence referendum in autumn 2018 or spring 2019 once the terms of the UK's Brexit deal "became known".

Prime Minister Theresa May has indicated that the UK government will refuse to allow another referendum in the SNP's preferred timescale, arguing that "now is not the time" with Brexit negotiations due to start shortly.
Ruth Davidson told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show that Nicola Sturgeon's call for such a vote was "not the will of the Scottish people".
Nicola Sturgeon insisted Scottish voters had the right to make a choice on the country's future "when the terms of Brexit are clear but before it's too late".
“She talks of outrage, and I wonder how outraged Mr Robbie is feeling today.”

Most people in Scotland are sick to death of the games Ruth Davidson

The SNP leader fired back at Ms Davidson, asking her to look at the manifesto in which she was elected on.
She replied: “I would like to ask Ms Davidson why she has omitted to quote the manifesto that I was elected as First Minister on last May?” Ms Davidson snapped back at the First Minister telling her to take responsibility for attempting to pull Scotland out of the UK, instead of blaming it on the Government.
Timescale negotiations

The SNP's 2016 manifesto said the Scottish Parliament should have the right to hold another referendum if there was "a significant and material change in the circumstances that prevailed in 2014, such as Scotland being taken out of the EU against our will".
