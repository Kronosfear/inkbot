“Last time in he used to be very keen and nearly got going with Tim going to the gates in a two-year-old trial but he hadn’t shown any signs of that this time in.”

The Warwick Farm track was rated a Heavy 9 on Tuesday and that’s Ryan’s main concern with Condor Heroes.
The talented two-year-old, who finished second to Khan at his only start in last spring’s Breeders’ Plate, was considered by many good judges as the best roughie in last week’s Golden Slipper.
But his Golden Slipper dream came to an abrupt end when Condor Heroes took off on the way to the barriers and was subsequently scratched from the Pago Pago Stakes, a race he had to win to make the Slipper field.
This Gerald Ryan trained colt has trialled twice, that last win in an 807m heat on the heavy 8 here at the Farm was something a bit special.
“She has done well, she is a good honest mare who has won a race in town and deserves to win another one.”
