  NOTE: ALL horses are considered starters unless notified by Monday at 1 PM. (N/R) denotes no rating.

RACE 1

THESE two Godolphin horses are very smart. I think Sanctioned could be a Sires/Champagne horse — he looks a really good horse for the future, near and far, at the 1400m+ but given this is an 1100m race I had to lean the way of his stablemate 7. ALMANZORA (N/R) with her being potentially a little bit more speedy perhaps over the trip. Gosh she trialled well at Randwick on Feb. 16. That was soft 6 that day and being a Lonhro out of a Commands mare, methinks heavy is no issue. I could talk all day about 7. SANCTIONED (N/R), I’ve said it all already but for the record, I reckon the best 2YO’s of the Godolphin crop as we stand are Toga Picta, Alizee, Trekking, Jorda and then Sanctioned. Of the others, 1. FAEGER (N/R) has the race experience and it was a crackerjack run when 2nd at Randwick on the soft 7 to Villa Carlotta. Can’t fault that.

RACE 2

8. FARSIGHT (N/R) is one that all the avid trial watchers will want to be on. This superbly bred (Arrowfield retained) daughter of All American and Ain’t Seen Nothin’ has been THE eye catcher in every one of those four heats dating back to Oct. 14 last year. I am certain with that pedigree that she will handle the wet, if anything she should be a Rough Habit! I reckon these two fillies in the first two races namely Almanzora and Farsight are stakes class so I am definitely with both and very happy to do so. I could have maybe thrown 2. ASTORIA (N/R) into my own personal Top 5 Godolphin 2YO’s, believe me, he could easily be in that group. I always thought that the best 2 triallers at the official 2YO heats at HQ back in the spring were Astoria and Jorda. Jorda’s won a Gimcrack, let’s see what Astoria can do on debut. 4. GO DADDY GO (N/R) is another Uncle Mo from the Anthony Cummings stable — he might have them all! Good trial behind Sanctioned into this.

RACE 3

IF the trials are anything to go by, it seems that 1. SWEET SERENDIPITY (73) is back in the kind of shape that he was when he was flying. Remember this horse? He won the Inglis 2YO Challenge on debut. The son of Excites is very fast and has a preset racing pattern of leading and going pretty quick wire to wire. This is 1000m at home and we know that most times when it’s very wet at the Farm that it’s best to be closer to first than last. Drawn 1 which means we know he’ll lead if he wants. 5. ALPEN ROSE (68) has the race fitness edge on the toppie and could end up right alongside him, or just behind, if ridden like she has been at her last two. The daughter of Swiss Ace is an absolute muddie with 4s 3w on heavy and placed 5 from 9 on slow. Hard to ignore 2. FIFTEEN SUNFLOWERS (72). She won at Wyong first-up with a big weight and late surge then came to HQ and swept aside Realise Potential and Glenall. She’s 5s 4w at 1000m and seems effective enough on wet.

RACE 4

11. TAMARACK (64) is a promising horse. He was $7 into $5.50 on debut at Wyong on Feb. 1 when 3.5-lens 2nd and basically ran out of ground. I mean, he was never ever going to pass Peaceful Sea (the winner) with the run she had. Tamarack went to Beaumont next time (raced handier) and thrashed two midweek city class horses in Think Like A Bird and Midnight Delight. That’s 1200m to 1350m and now a mile at home. The Gun on tomorrow again. Both wins on good but he’s got a wet trackers pedigree. 6. POTENT FORCE (66) was a shade disappointing first-up at Rosehill in that midweeker on Feb. 22. That said, he wasn’t humiliated by any means and you knew as they crossed the line that he was looking for the mile. Quite a few other chances here chief among them is 4. KARAVALI (70) whose only run on heavy was back home in NZ when she ran 4th in the G1 Sire’s Produce beaten 0.9-lens. Third-up here off two 2nds for new trainer Kris Lees. 9. EARTH (64) — big improver!

RACE 5

I REMEMBER thinking and writing how 10. OCTAVIAN AUGUSTUS (62) was going to win the Carbine Club. He didn’t, his stablemate Comin’ Through did but I still retain a soft spot for this fellow. He had two nice trials leading into the return at Rosehill (midweeker Feb. 22) which accounts for the $6 into $4.20 on the day. The horse ran 8th of 10 but he was only beaten 2-lens and while he didn’t necessarily make much ground, he didn’t lose any either. His second-up form is not flash and he’s a bit unknown on heavy but he handles slow. There are a good half dozen chances in this race not least 7. DRACHENFELS (65) who is lightly raced and rather talented. He beat 6. DORTMUND (66) second-up at Beaumont and we know the form was solid given that Dortmund himself has won since — well, he actually bolted in by 4.3-lens. Nods to 3. AJANI (68) and the always honest 4. STAR SHAFT (67).

RACE 6

1. JEMADAR (72) is a Godolphin bred Sepoy gelding that is also first-up. He is 4s 2-2-0 and 1 from 1 fresh. Loved his two trials — don’t worry about the 6th of 8 and 8th of 9 finishing positions, he was super both times. He has been placed 2nd from his only run on slow, this might be heavy and while Sepoy’s would be a risk on the slop as a general rule, every horse is different and he seemed to be sweet in that last trial on the heavy 8 at Rosehill. 4. BE LIKE DAD (67) is another of the first-upers here. He is 4s 0-2-0 fresh and what I like best about him is that his 4s 0-1-2 on heavy. One just cannot knock the Chris Waller trained 5. NOTHING BOX (67) on that big first-up win at Rosehill. Drawn 1 which will make it easy to lead or be in the top 3 if that is the plan which I suspect it is.

RACE 7

TRIAL horse again here folks — 9. FANTASIZE (67) from the Snowden camp. The daughter of Authorized was a super 2nd in her Randwick heat on Feb. 16 and we know she backs it up on race day given she is 3s 1-1-0 fresh and 7s 2-2-0 overall. Re the wet she is more than adept on slow and I’d have no worry about an Authorized on wet. 3. DIAMOND MADE (71) didn’t come up to any degree in the spring but we start again in the autumn now and cross fingers. It’s a very big risk to just assume she’s going to suddenly bounce back to form after a lot of ‘outs’ but she’s with a good trainer, she is at home, she likes the wet. Want big odds though. 2. COTTAGE (74) is 1 for 1 at the track and 2 for 2 at the trip. Two important stats on top of those are that she is 2s 1-1-0 and, or should that be BUT, she is 1s 0-0-0 on soft and no runs on heavy.

RACE 8

2. NEW UNIVERSE (67) is just about the most interesting runner all day. He is a Waller recruit who is 3s 2w and a 5th in NZ. Last run was the 5th at Ellerslie on Boxing Day so it’s not like he is first-up for months. The trial was really good, very Waller-esque — hit the line with a full tank! By Darci Brahma who is adored in NZ and the female line is huge 3rd Dam is Eau D’Etoile. It’s a fabulous race actually, six of the 15 are last start winners including 4. BRAVISSIMO (66) and 5. I THOUGHT SO (66). We know Bravissimo handles the slop, he won his maiden here on the heavy 10 On Feb. 8 beating two handy fillies in Red Hearts and Smart Amelia. As for I Thought So, well ‘I knew so’ that he would win at Randwick first-up; you don’t trial like it did and come out and lose. It was a good fighting win from a very gutsy and super handsome colt. Racing at home tomorrow. I am going to watch the flucs like a hawk and decide what to do after we see what the markets do with New Universe — surely they back him!

RACE 9

ANOTHER tough race, it sure is a competitive day tomorrow, let’s hope the sun comes out and we get a fair surface. Any one of a these horses could win this race, any one at all, seriously. I’m with 7. STEEL FROST (70) mainly because I was watching him coming up through the grades very quickly last prep. He has two big changes tomorrow in terms of gear; blinkers on, winkers off — first time both. The only time he raced on a rain affected track was a slow 6 at Canberra and he won by 5-lens. 11. OUR VENTURA (67) is a genuine muddie being 4s 1-2-0 on heavy tracks. She’s back from the paddock here with the aid of two trials. She is a big, big player with no weight at all. Sometimes the numbers say it better than words even can and that’s the story with 3. MONOGRAM (77) who is 4s 2-0-1 fresh and 1 for 1 on the heavy. She hasn’t raced in a far while (Jul. 2016) but trialled twice and without wishing to sound patronising, the stable know what they are doing.

RACE 10

A TRUE Get Out Stakes here, anything goes, value is the order of the day. Not many of us can afford to bet on three horses in the one race but I am so torn between my trio that it might be on the only way? That said, I am happy to have the Mark Newnham trained 10. RIGHTEOUS MATE (68) on top here. The 3YO is 4s 1-1-1 and you may remember that he won a Gosford maiden on Oct. 13 then on Nov. 3 he came from last to run 1-lens 2nd in a Listed 1800m race at Flemington at the carnival. Not flash in the ring Stakes first-up I concede, but went back to the drawing board and trialled enormous! I have a massive watch on 12. LEAD CHOREOGRAPHER (65) from the Waller camp. He was $21 first run for Waller in Oz and I could not fault it — he was 6th of 10 beaten 5.5-lens but he never yielded any ground in the straight, He just wants the mile now. 9. CANNON RUN (67) has a lot going for him. He has been racing in great form and is obviously a very fit horse.</p>
