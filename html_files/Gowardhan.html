  A look at our pick of the lot.

It's true that there's no dearth of campaigns celebrating women and speaking for their rights, but every year, brands go the extra mile on March 8 or International Women's Day to make them feel a lot more important and special.

Here are some campaigns that caught our attention this time...

UrbanClap

Picking up from where it left with its LGBT oriented campaign, 'Come Out for Love,' UrbanClap takes a step further this Women's Day by celebrating gender acceptance and inclusiveness. The video titled 'My First Women's Day' shows a woman celebrating her son's decision to go for a sex-change operation and how she welcomes him to an all-new world. It ends with the message that acceptance begins at home.

Brooke Bond Red Label

"A good man can make every day Women's Day," says the tea brand in its new Women's Day ad. And he can do so just by making a cup of tea for both himself and 'her'. Taking on stereotypes, this ad shows a little boy preparing tea in his toy kitchen. Yes, some of his toys are pink too, but that doesn't make him a girl! The campaign is called #Unstereotype.

Reliance Fresh

The retail chain's campaign, #JeeLeZara featuring actors Renuka Shahane and Sachin Khedekar prompts every woman to ask herself a very important question, "When will I go to Goa if not at 50?" The irony delivers the message with ease.

Star Sports

Star Sports' campaign #CheckOutMyGame takes reference from various sports such as cricket, badminton, kabaddi, gymnastics, swimming, boxing and wrestling in which women actively participate. The TVC features Olympic heroes PV Sindhu, Sakshi Malik, Dipa Karmakar, Mary Kom and other celebrated sportswomen who continue to be an inspiration.

Datsun redi-GO

On International Women's Day, Datsun India has announced a special offer for women thinking of buying a car. It has also rolled out an online campaign, #DrivenByHer to celebrate contemporary women and challenge existing mindsets towards women drivers in society.

Parag Milk Foods

As an expression of gratitude towards women, Gowardhan Ghee - the flagship product of Parag Milk Foods - has launched a campaign, #CookForHer that urges men to thank the ladies in their lives.

JSW Group

Indian conglomerate JSW Group which has footprints across core economic sectors, namely, steel, energy, infrastructure, cement, ventures and sports, celebrates the struggles and victories of women in a campaign featuring Sakshi Malik. Titled #EveryWomanStrong the ad builds on the thought that while it is easy to celebrate known achievers, for every woman who makes it to the spotlight, there are many more who continue to fight across every walk of life.

Urban Ladder

The brand's Women's Day campaign urges women to 'reclaim their space' and be where they belong, which is not the kitchen or the bar, but "wherever the hell they damn well please". The minimalistic execution makes use of sounds superimposed on the text which stands out against a bold red background.

#SheForHer by Gypsy Moth

Digital storytelling agency, Gypsy Moth has come up with a campaign, #SheForHer, which elucidates how the world can become a better and safer place for women, if only they stand up for and accept each other.

P&G

P&G's global campaign, #WeSeeEqual leverages the organisation's insights to uncover gender bias. It takes action to spark conversations and set new expectations that motivate change. The video descriptor on YouTube reads, "A gender equal world is a better world for all. Through our actions and the conversations that we spark, we aspire to build a better world for all of us - inside and outside of P&G - free from gender bias and with equal representation and an equal voice for women and men. A world where everyone sees equal."</p>
