  Internationally, Bracco had five points in seven games to help the United States win the 2017 world junior hockey championship.Today it was leaked that the Toronto Maple Leafs signed their 2015 draft pick Jeremy Bracco to an entry level deal:

The #leafs have signed Jeremy Bracco to a three-year, entry-level contract.
"They said 'welcome and the work just starts now and what you do to get here is great and all but you’re going to have to double the workload to be back,' " Bracco said, adding that the team told him that come mini camp he would be provided with nutritionists and trainers and "all the resources" he needed to become an NHL player for the franchise.

Jeremy Bracco and the Windsor Spitfires will take on Maple Leafs prospects J.J. Piccinich and Nicolas Mattinen and the London Knights in round one of the OHL playoffs.
"The Leafs were in the back of my mind as one of those storied franchises that would be great to be a part of and part of something that they’re rebuilding and becoming better with the younger players," Bracco said.

Bracco spoke with PPP after the draft in 2015 and wanted everyone to know he’d be on the Maple Leafs one day, and saw a bright future for the team:

For Bracco, that the team hasn't won is just more fuel, something added to accomplish.
