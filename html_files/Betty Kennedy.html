ABOUT KENNEDY CENTER JAZZ

Kennedy Center Jazz, under the leadership of Artistic Director Jason Moran, presents legendary artists who have helped shape the art form, artists who are emerging on the jazz scene, and innovative multidisciplinary projects in hundreds of performances a year.
"The John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts today announced the participants in BetTy Carter's Jazz Ahead (BCJA)-the international jazz residency, performance, and composition project discovering and presenting the next generation of jazz greats-to be held March 20-31, 2017 at the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C.
After Carter's untimely death in September 1998, the Carter family graciously granted the Kennedy Center the opportunity to continue her legacy by making the program an annual Kennedy Center event.
