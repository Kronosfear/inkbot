  “I’m sure as long as everybody is playing in the right way and giving 100 per cent, as we always do, we will be able to get through to the next round.”The Red Devils defender needed extra energy during the 1-0 win over Rostov, and was passed the fruit by manager Jose Mourinho

Manchester United's 1-0 win over Rostov at Old Trafford was far from the most entertaining game ever seen in the Europa League, but one moment stood out for fans at the ground and watching at home.
As a club, we’ve never won this competition so we’re looking to make history.”

Young played in a three-man defence against Rostov in the first leg and no matter what formation Mourinho chooses tonight United will be going for the win.
Jose Mourinho's men take on FC Rostov tonight in the second leg of their last 16 tie at Old Trafford after a 1-1 draw in the first leg.
“It’s an opportunity to get in the Champions League and we will be prepared, with everybody recovered and players coming back; players will be fresh come kick-off time on Thursday and it’s an important game.
Young added: "We’ve always said, every competition we’re in, we want to go and win,” he said.
