  A permanent dismissal can be triggered in five situations under the Constitution Act, 1867:

The senator is absent for more than two consecutive sessions

The senator goes bankrupt

The senator does not meet residency or property qualifications in the province they represent

The senator declares their allegiance or adherence to a foreign power

The senator is found guilty of treason, or is convicted of a felony

None of these situations apply to Meredith.
In any other workplace, Meredith would be fired, Cullen said, "The Senate's solution is to send him to a women's conference."
Can the Senate expel Don Meredith?6:01

"The Senate has all the powers that are necessary to protect its integrity and to assure its proper functioning, and that includes the power to discipline senators, and it can go all the way up to expelling members," Marc-André Roy, a constitutional law expert who spent several years working for the Senate, said in an interview.
Meredith has faced repeated — and very public — calls to resign over the past week in the wake of a report from the Senate’s ethics watchdog, who alleged that the 52-year-old senator had sexual relations with a teen once before she turned 18, and twice after she turned 18.
He has publicly called on Meredith to resign, and has mused about the possibility of expulsion.Canadian senators are reportedly mulling their options this week as they confront another scandal involving a member of the Upper Chamber, but expelling Sen. Don Meredith permanently may be easier said than done.
