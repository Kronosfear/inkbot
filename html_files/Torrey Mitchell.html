  <p class="newsbody"><b><i>Hudson, Texas:</i></b>
  VANCOUVER — The Canadiens extended their winning streak to six games and improved to 7-2-0 since Claude Julien took over from Michel Therrien as head coach on Valentine’s Day, with a 2-1 overtime win over the Vancouver Canucks Tuesday night at the Rogers Arena.

It has been pretty much a love affair ever since the coaching change for the much-improved Canadiens with Carey Price playing Cupid, but it was Paul Byron who scored the winning goal at 1:13 of overtime, deflecting a shot by Alex Galchenyuk.

Price made 27 saves to win his fifth straight start and has allowed only five goals during that span. The Canadiens outshot the Canucks 38-28.

Torrey Mitchell scored in the first period for the Canadiens and Michael Chaput scored for the Canucks in the third period.

The Canadiens increased their lead to six points over the second-place Ottawa Senators in the Atlantic Division. Ottawa holds three games in hand.

Mitchell ends long slump: The Canadiens went more than three minutes before getting their first shot on goal by Galchenyuk, but Mitchell opened the scoring shortly after when he deflected a point shot from Andrei Markov behind goalie Ryan Miller at 3:57 of the first period. Mitchell had gone 39 games without a goal. The last time Mitchell scored was Dec. 8 when he had two goals against the New Jersey Devils at the Bell Centre. The Greenfield Park native, who had five goals in the first 10 games, now has eight for the season. The Canucks outshot the Canadiens 11-10 in the first period.

Close call for Gally: There was no scoring in the second period, but Brendan Gallagher had the best chance for the Canadiens when he broke in alone on Miller with 2:35 remaining in the period and the goalie made a real nice glove stop. The Canadiens dominated the period, outshooting the Canucks 16-4.

Chaput ties it up: Chaput tied it up for the Canucks at the 12:49 mark of the third period when he was left alone in front of Price and deflected a point shot by Alexander Edler. It was the 23rd shot of the game for the Canucks. Chaput snuck in behind the defence pair of Jeff Petry and Brandon Davidson. The shots on goal were 37-28 for the Canadiens after three periods.

Habs debut for Davidson: Davidson made his Canadiens debut after being acquired from the Edmonton Oilers last week in exchange for David Desharnais. Alexei Emelin, who has struggled recently, was made a healthy scratch. The Canadiens were also without Alexander Radulov (lower-body injury) for the second straight game and Tomas Plekanec (upper-body injury). Plekanec had played in a team-leading 236 consecutive games dating back to March 29, 2014. Brian Flynn suffered an upper-body injury during the first period and didn’t return.

“Go, Habs, Go!”: It was almost like a home game for the Canadiens with all the Habs sweaters in the house and chants of “Go, Habs, Go!” and “Ca-rey! Ca-rey!” breaking out throughout the game. It can’t be easy for the home team when that happens in their own rink. What’s that again about the Maple Leafs being Canada’s team?

What’s next: The Canadiens flew to Calgary after the game. They have a practice scheduled for Wednesday afternoon at the Saddledome and will play the Flames Thursday night (9 p.m., SNE, RDS, TSN Radio 690). The Canadiens will enjoy an off day Friday in Edmonton, practise Saturday at Rogers Place and then wrap up their Western Canada trip Sunday against the Oilers (7 p.m., SN, RDS, TSN Radio 690).
