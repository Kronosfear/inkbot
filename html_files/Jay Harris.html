  “We will be working with all of them in different ways to think how they rethink elements of their practices to accommodate our mission.”

Other professors questioned Harris about the 75 minute class block and associated passing time, asking if existing classes would have to alter their length or if students would have too much passing time in if a professor did not use the entire 75 minutes.
“Sometimes this is done by questioning the motives and thus stigmatizing those who dissent from prevailing opinions; or by disrupting their presentations; or by demanding that they be excluded from campus or, if they have already been invited, disinvited.”

After leaving Harvard for nearly 14 years following a high-profile fight with then president Lawrence H. Summers, West returned at the beginning of the semester to become a “professor of the practice of public philosophy.”

Harvard-affiliated signatories of the statement include Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris and former Harvard Medical School Dean Jeffrey S. Flier.
Follow him on Twitter @wlwang20.Faculty pressed Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris on a new policy that would alter course schedules and increase standard class length to 75 minutes at the Faculty meeting Tuesday.
“Those students, it would seem, therefore have a reduced number of classes that they could attend.”

Responding to Engell, Harris said that many schools, including Stanford, begin classes at 8 a.m. and that athletic teams may have to adjust their practices to accommodate the proposed change.
University President Drew G. Faust ended discussion of the motion shortly after 5:00 p.m. and told Faculty that discussion will continue at April’s meeting, when the Faculty could potentially approve the motion.
