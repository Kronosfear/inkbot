  Mark Sampson's side have won just one of their last five games

England Women will name their 23-strong squad for Euro 2017 more than three months before the tournament begins in July, says head coach Mark Sampson.
"Mark's decision to name the squad early will give us the chance to prepare properly and focus on doing as well as possible come July," said Football Association technical director Dan Ashworth.
Sampson will name his squad ahead of friendly matches against Italy on 7 April and Austria three days later, as England prepare for Euro 2017, which begins in the Netherlands on 16 July.
Some of England's players are currently representing their clubs in the FA Cup, with the one-off Spring Series kicking-off on 22 April and acting as a transitional tournament due to the traditional WSL season being moved to a September start.
Ex-England boss Roy Hodgson named his men's squad less than four weeks before Euro 2016 but Sampson feels doing so early will "bring huge benefits".
The Lionesses - who finished third at the 2015 World Cup - were unbeaten in eight qualifying games but have won just one of five outings, including defeats to France and Germany at the SheBelieves Cup.Barclays no longer sees euro-dollar parity in 2017

"At the World Cup we prided ourselves on being one of the most united and together teams and we put a big part of our success down to that, so we'll be able to build on this even further over the next three months."
"As a coaching staff it also allows us to focus on working with the 23 players as early as possible and develop our game plans.
