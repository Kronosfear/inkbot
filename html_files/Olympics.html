  “I think getting your name on the Stanley Cup is something you dream about, but playing for your country in the Olympics and best on best, there is no better event, there is none,” said Babcock, who has coached Canada to back-to-back Olympic gold medals.
Meanwhile, last week Senators defenceman Erik Karlsson said he'd like to go to the Olympics, although Melnyk gave a "flat no" to the idea allowing Karlsson to go without NHL participation.
I’ve represented my country at the NTDP (U.S. national team development program), world championship and world junior and it is always pretty special to put on your country’s jersey.”



Marchand was asked whether he would be disappointed if it’s determined NHL players won’t be going to South Korea.
“For athletes to get themselves to that level where they can have the opportunity to play in the Olympics, and then for someone to take it away from them, I don’t think it’s really fair, but that is a long ways away.”



Marchand has represented Canada four times, but not in the Olympic games.
Time is running short on a decision to go in 2018, but the league didn't settle on attending the 2014 Games in Sochi until July of 2013.Players across the National Hockey League have been making it clear for awhile that they want to participate in the 2018 Winter Olympics in South Korea.
