  Heyfield timber mill could be taken over by Victorian Government if board chooses to close it

Updated

Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews says his government could take the "uncoventional" step of taking over the Heyfield timber mill to save more than 250 jobs, after months of uncertainty about the mill's future.

Updated

Workers from the Heyfield sawmill in Gippsland have gathered in Melbourne, arguing their industry is sustainable and urging the Victorian Government to increase the amount of timber supplied.
"I just sort of feel that it's a bit tricky in that if ASH and the present employers pull out, I don't know how that would leave the workers themselves with say the government running the factory or the mill," she said.
Premier Daniel Andrews said if ASH decided to sell the mill and another buyer could not be found, the Government would take the "unconventional" step of a takeover.
With the mill's future hanging in the balance, the State Government said it would take an "interventionist approach" to keep the site open.
