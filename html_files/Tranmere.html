  Rovers simply could not burst a solid defence who kept the likes of Andy Cook and Connor Jennings quiet.Injuries have played their part in that and the recent form, which stretches to four games without a win.Losing Ben Tollitt to damaged knee ligaments was a bitter blow, whilst Jake Kirby, Lois Maynard, James Wallace and Jack Dunn have all been missing too.The latter three should play again this season - but no date has been penciled in for a return yet.“None of the ones who are injured will be available for Tuesday,” Mellon added.“But they’re making decent progress.

Man of the Match: JAY HARRIS - Like a terrier in midfield.
“We’ll be going with the group that we have and we’ll just keep going and make no excuses.”TRANMERE Rovers aim to bounce back from defeat in the FA Trophy semi-final when they face North Ferriby United in national league action tonight.
Looking ahead to tonight's fixture in an interview on the club's website Mellon said: "It's a huge game, but they're all huge matches now until the end of the season.
Rovers, currently third on the table with 67 points, were denied a trip to Wembley on Saturday as Macclesfield dumped them out of the FA Trophy in a tight semi-final second leg at Prenton Park.
