GB SQUAD FOR QUARTER-FINAL AGAINST FRANCE Dan Evans, Kyle Edmund, Jamie Murray, Dominic Inglot

The days are gone when all hope is lost in Murray's absence but there will now be a huge onus on 22 year-old Kyle Edmund, by far Britain's most proficient clay court player.
Andy Murray was part of the GB team that won the Davis Cup in 2015

Davis Cup quarter-final: France v Great Britain Venue: Kindarena, Rouen Dates: 7-9 April Starts: 13:00 BST Coverage: Live on BBC One or BBC Two across all three days with extra coverage on BBC Red Button, connected TVs, the BBC Sport website and app.
Murray could also miss out on the Monte Carlo Open - his next scheduled tournament

The 29-year-old's absence makes hosts France the favourites for the Davis Cup contest

'Jamie (Murray) and Dom (Inglot) once again combine as our doubles team and will draw much confidence after performing so well recently to win key rubbers against Serbia and Canada.
Edmund and Evans are also in the top 50, but Evans has not contested a tournament on clay since May 2015.British Davis Cup captain Leon Smith confirmed on Tuesday that his side will suffer the huge blow of Andy Murray not being available for next week's quarter final away to France.
Big three miss out for France

There is no place in the France team for three of their top four players, with Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, Gael Monfils and Richard Gasquet not selected by captain Yannick Noah.
Andy Murray will miss Great Britain's Davis Cup quarter-final against France next month as he recovers from an elbow injury.
Analysis

BBC tennis correspondent Russell Fuller

There was no Murray in Canada for the first round tie, and Britain still won, but this French side hds six top 50 players to choose from - plus the world doubles number one Nicolas Mahut.
"In Dan and Kyle we have two top-50 singles players who are improving all the time on the tour and both with games capable of upsetting higher ranked opponents," added Smith.
