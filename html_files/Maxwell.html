  But keeping aside personal landmarks, Smith ensured that Australia finished the day on a high and in the company of Glenn Maxwell, who was playing only his fourth Test and first since November 2014, played an equally responsible knock as the two shared unbroken 159 for the fifth wicket on a good batting pitch – the highest partnership of the series so far.
India was on the offensive after lunch but ran into a roadblock in the form of Smith and Maxwell.Australia captain Steve Smith continued to lead from the front, as he did in the previous two sessions of the day to help his team reach a comfortable 299/4 at stumps on the opening day of the third Test at the JSCA International Stadium here on Thursday.
Two to tango

It takes two to tango, and Smith and Maxwell combined to lift the Aussies from a troubling 140 for four to a more secure 299 without the loss of another wicket on the opening day of the third Test.
On a day when he reached 5000 Test runs in only his 97th innings — he is the seventh quickest to achieve the feat in terms of innings played — Smith applied himself and absorbed the pressure.
There wasn’t much spin on the first day pitch — the little turn that the bowlers managed to extract was slow — but the odd ball definitely kept low.
