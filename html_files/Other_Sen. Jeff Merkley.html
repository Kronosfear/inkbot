  Sen Jeff Merkley says he's planning on holding the Senate floor *all night* to protest Judge Gorsuch & a 'stolen' SCOTUS seat —via @MSNBC pictwittercom/gNPB6oGOAv — Kyle Griffin (@kylegriffin1) April 5, 2017

On Tuesday afternoon, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) filed for “cloture” — to move to a vote — on Gorsuch’s nomination

All Republicans are expected to vote to confirm Gorsuch

When my colleagues say, “We’re not going to treat Gorsuch the way Republicans treated Garland,” what they’re saying is, “He’ll get a committee hearing; he’ll get vetted in committee” Knowing Republicans have control, they know he’ll get to the floor</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" align="center"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Sen.

Sen Jeff Merkley (D-OR) left his office in the Senate Hart Building at around 6 pm Tuesday afternoon, walked to the US Capitol, and took to the Senate floor to criticize Donald Trump Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch
That’s what’s at stake hereThe battle over President Trump’s Supreme Court nominee was on full display Wednesday morning in the Senate, where one Democratic senator was delivering a marathon speech against Judge Neil Gorsuch that started Tuesday evening
“I think it is crazy that we are considering confirming a lifetime Trump nominee to the Supreme Court at a moment when the president’s campaign is under the cloud of an active, ongoing FBI counterintelligence investigation that could result in indictments and appeals that will go all the way to the Supreme Court so that Trump’s nominee could be the deciding vote on whether Trump or his supporters broke the law and will be held accountable
The nuclear option — in this case, allowing high court nominees to be approved by a simple majority — may also further poison relations between Democrats and Republicans as each side is embittered by the other’s behavior
Over the next 12 hours, he portrayed Gorsuch as an extreme nominee, took aim at Trump and slammed Republicans for not moving ahead with President Barack Obama’s nomination of Merrick Garland to the court last year
