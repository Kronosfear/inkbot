  Even though his stance appears to have moderated Dimon said on Tuesday the bank is preparing for a so-called "hard Brexit" in which Britain loses access to EU's single market, disrupting access to its main trading partner

LONDON The head of US bank JPMorgan Chase (JPMN) said on Tuesday the bank is not planning to move many jobs out of Britain in the next two years in a softening of tone on the likely impact from Brexit
Staff were told today that Michele Colocci will be rejoining the bank from Morgan Stanley, where he was chairman of M&A across Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA), as well as co-head of healthcare investment banking</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" align="center"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">JP MORGAN:<br>June 2016: &#39;Leave could mean 4,000 jobs cut&#39;<br>April 2017: &#39;Not moving many people&#39; <a href="https://t.co/QQ9HN5wH7o">https://t.co/QQ9HN5wH7o</a></p>&mdash; Westmonster (@WestmonsterUK) <a href="https://twitter.com/WestmonsterUK/status/849525547436834818">April 5, 2017</a></blockquote>

"This does not entail moving many people in the next two years," he said in a letter to the US bank's shareholders
Jamie Dimon had said in a previous speech to employees in Bournemouth last year that as many as 4,000 of the bank's 16,000 jobs based in Britain may have to move
