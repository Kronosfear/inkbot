  It is not immediately obvious what the US Secretary of State meant when he said that the period of "strategic patience" with North Korea is over, or what President Trump had in mind saying that the US did not need China's help with North Korea
He has backed down on two threats--to cite China as a currency manipulator (on day one) and to abandon the US recognition of only one China
