  TERRIFIED locals have described how a “maniac” knifeman attacked two women and cops before turning the blade on himself in scenes similar to a “war zone”.

The suspect killed a woman in her 30s and left another fighting for her life during the rampage in Wolverhampton this morning.

Armed cops used stun grenades as they stormed the flat in a bid to "distract and detain the knifeman" after they were confronted by him wielding the blade.

Officers tried using a Taser, which failed, and the suspect slashed the arm of one cop and stabbed another in the leg while chasing the pair out of the flat.

He then turned the blade on himself and was pronounced dead at the scene.

Terrified residents said the scene was like a "war zone" as they barricaded themselves in their flats while armed police tried stopping the man.

One said: "There was a maniac running around and police were chasing him with firearms.

"Some people were told to get out by police while others just barricaded themselves inside. It was terrifying. There was lots of shouting and noise.

"We heard gunshots but I think it was stun grenades going off as they tried to distract and disarm him. There was blood in the corridors. It was like urban warfare."

Pauline Turner, who lives on the eighth floor, said: "The first I knew of it was when all the sirens started blaring and the helicopters landed. It was like a war zone.

"I heard the police trying to bash down the door to a flat just before 10. It was so loud, the sound shook right through my flat."

A man and a woman, both aged in their 30s have died, while another woman, aged in her 50s, was rushed to hospital with critical stomach wounds.

One cop was slashed in the arm, and the other was injured in the leg when he was "chased" by the knifeman.

Twitter 16 The major incident is still ongoing

Terrified residents were evacuated as emergency services scrambled to the flat in Merry Hill.

Some said the scene - swarming with cops and paramedics - was like something from a "disaster film".

Kelsey Nuttall told the Express and Star she was told to flee the building by police because of a "madman".

She added: "[An officer] told me to go run down the street and stay well away as ‘there is a madman on the loose.’

“Suddenly there was lots of police here - there must have been at least 10 vans and officers started running into the flats.”

A neighbour who didn't want to be named said: "At first we thought we had heard gunshots coming from a flat below us.

"But when we got outside and saw all the police and the smoke we realised it had been some sort of stun grenades.

"I've never seen anything like it in my life, there were armed cops everywhere and three air ambulances. It was really dramatic, like some sort of disaster film.

"We were told it was a domestic stabbing and two people had died. It is really tragic."

Sean Delaney, who lives on the ground floor, said police told him to "get out now" as he was getting ready to leave.

Nearby St Michael's School was put on lockdown during the terrifying rampage but has since reopened.

Speaking at the scene, Chief Superintendent Kevin Fraser said: "Two officers were injured. One has a stab wound to the arm and the other has a leg injury after being chased by the suspect.

"This is a really shocking incident and our sympathies go out to the families and friends of those involved."
