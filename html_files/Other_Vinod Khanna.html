  Veteran actor Vinod Khanna, who will be seen in Ek Thi Rani Aisi Bhi releasing on April 2, has been admitted to HN Reliance Foundation and Research Centre in Girgaon, Mumbai after he complained of discomfort
Vinod Khanna‚Äôs deteriorated health could be one reason why he missed the trailer launch of his movie, Ek Thi Rani Aisi Bhi, in which he is portraying the role of the king of Gwalior, opposite Hema Malini who is playing the role of Vijaya Raje Scindia, the queen of Gwalior
‚ÄúHe was admitted on Sunday, April 2, and not on Friday, March 31 (some reports came in that the veteran actor was hospitalised on Friday)
We are just wishing that he is out of the hospital soon‚Äù

An official from the hospital, however, stated that Vinod Khanna was admitted on Sunday</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" align="center"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">pray to <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/VinodKhanna?src=hash">#VinodKhanna</a> ji<br>for Recover Soon from All Salman Fans<a href="https://twitter.com/BeingSalmanKhan">@BeingSalmanKhan</a> always Love N Care Vinod Khanna ji<br>example üëâ Dabangg 1,2 &amp; 3 <a href="https://t.co/OUTBFWJUhD">pic.twitter.com/OUTBFWJUhD</a></p>&mdash; SALMAN ROCK (@skfrocks) <a href="https://twitter.com/skfrocks/status/849484025886584833">April 5, 2017</a></blockquote>
