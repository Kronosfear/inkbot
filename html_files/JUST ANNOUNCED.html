  WASHINGTON D.C., March 7, 2017 /3BL Media/ - PYXERA Global is delighted to announce the expansion of its relationship with Ethical Corporation. Building on the momentum of the two organizations’ partnership, this alliance will drive the movement for responsible business, CSR, and sustainability executives to link social purpose to profit.

Amanda MacArthur, Chief Program Officer at PYXERA Global, will present alongside The Rockefeller Foundation on the YieldWise initiative at Ethical Corporation’s 16th Responsible Business Summit Europe taking place in London on June 7-8. The session, Unlikely alliances: finding common ground when working from different agendas, will demonstrate how the use of tri-sector partnerships like YieldWise, a $130 million initiative launched by The Rockefeller Foundation to demonstrate potential solutions for how the world can halve food loss by 2030, can lead to unparalleled results.
