  “My wife and I went to a Cubs World Series game, and getting a picture with the mascot and here comes Chris Collins in his Cubs jersey and his wife,” said Drew.
“I wish we would have taken a group photo if we would have known this was going to happen,” said Wildcats head coach Chris Collins of the historic run-in with friend and Commodores’ coach Bryce Drew.
"We gave each other a hug, said, 'Go, Cubs,' and kept it moving," Collins said.
"He would make decisions I didn't agree with," Bryce Drew said.
"If he ever senses that he's overstepping his bounds, he backs off," Chris Collins said.
