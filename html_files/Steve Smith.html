  Away averages:

Steve Smith: 59.10 (nine of his 19 hundreds)

Virat Kohli: 44.61 (nine of his 16 hundreds)

Joe Root: 44.89 (three of his 11 hundreds)

Kane Williamson: 46.41 (nine of his 16 hundreds)

While these numbers might drop (or rise) a little on Friday depending on how much he eventually makes, Smith has shown himself to be adept at facing spin and equally comfortable against the fast bowlers in varying conditions.
Glenn Maxwell was batting on 19 at tea, having put on 54 runs for the fifth wicket along with his captain.Indian captain Virat Kohli went off the field for treatment after hurting his shoulder while diving to stop a run, as India put the brakes on the scoring after a high-scoring first session.
He didn’t look for quick runs, he just looked to stay at the wicket and the rest – like his batting technique – just fell into place.
Matt Renshaw (44) was going well and looked set to complete a hat-trick of half-centuries before falling six runs short with Umesh Yadav dismissing the opener in his second spell after a smart change of ends by Virat Kohli.
A flick off the pad from Renshaw raced to boundary for Australia's first runs on the board in the first over of Ishant Sharma.
