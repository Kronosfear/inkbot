  See Vermont is now 2lb lower than his last winning mark and has hardly been found an epic encounter in which to haul himself back on the straight and narrow.SEE the cards and full and fast results from Thursday’s meet at Hexham.
Spiritual Star was stealthily held up by his jockey before he was produced with what looked a potentially winning run inside the final three furlongs.
SEE VERMONT has constantly found winning hard to do since he struck at Musselburgh last August – but all that might change when he lines up for the Betway Sprint Handicap.
Yet with the momentum seemingly behind him, Lee Carter's inmate suddenly encountered a good deal of traffic problems inside the final 250 yards.
With the forecast set fair, he should find things highly suitable in what is not a particularly strong race, while John Kington claims a handy 3lb on board today's nap selection.
He cut no ice back on the Flat most recently but a mark of 90 looks beyond him these days and he will be more at home bossing inferior opponents over jumps.
He was not beaten at all far at Newcastle earlier in the month either and it is also pleasing to see jockey Danny Tudhope keep the faith.
In three previous starts over timber he has been second twice and won at Musselburgh – and it is notable he is being kept to sharp, flat tracks like this.
