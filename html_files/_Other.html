Clomiphene: used in women to treat some types of infertility;

Ketotifen: an add-on medication in the treatment of chronic asthma in children;

“The products are promoted to treat cancer, infertility, respiratory diseases, enlarged thyroid and erectile dysfunction and are labelled to contain various prescription drugs that may pose serious risks to the health of Canadians,” the health agency said in a written warning on its website.
The products include several prescription drugs used to treat women with breast cancer, a veterinary drug used to treat respiratory diseases in horses, and prescription drugs used to treat erectile dysfunction.
The agency says it seized the products from the distributor and is working with Canada Border Services Agency to stop the products from being imported.
The agency says it has seized 10 products from EPCA Shipping Inc., which it says is the Canadian distributor for Extreme Peptides, a company that sells health products online.
Health Canada says in a news release that the seized products are labelled to contain various prescription drugs that could pose a serious health risk.
