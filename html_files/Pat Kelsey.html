  "CINCINNATI -- The morning of March 5, during Winthrop’s shoot-around for the Big South Conference men’s basketball championship, coach Pat Kelsey had never seen a more focused Eagles team.
UMass will hire former Winthrop University head coach Pat Kelsey as its new basketball coach, the school announced today.
“There were so many serious things that he said that applied to teaching and life and basketball as well that were so prophetic.”

Pat Kelsey, head in hand in background, with his mentor at Wake Forest, the late Skip Prosser.
"Pat has been an important piece of some highly successful programs throughout his career, including the last five years leading the basketball program at Winthrop University.
“I recharged my batteries a bit and I was very fortunate to have the opportunity to become a head coach at a tradition-rich program at Winthrop.”

Kelsey was introduced as Winthrop’s head coach in 2012.
