The report contained a qualitative analysis of three post-determination native title agreements in WA: the 2013 ILUA between Yindjibarndi Aboriginal Corporation and Rio Tinto in the Pilbara; the 2005 ILUA between the Miriuwung-Gajerrong people, operating MG Corp, and the WA government in the Ord River valley, known as the Ord final agreement; and a series of right to negotiate or future acts agreements between the Gooiyandi Aboriginal Corporation and pastoral stations in the the Fitzroy Valley.
