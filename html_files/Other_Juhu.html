For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App nowMumbai: In a legal setback to Vijaypat Singhania and his son Gautam , the Bombay high court dismissed their appeal over an order requiring them to first vacate their luxury Juhu bungalow in a family dispute over property
A bench of Justices V M Kanade and Swapna Joshi held that an order directing execution of an arbitral award is not appealableThe order that Vijaypat Singhania and Gautam wanted to appeal was an order passed by Justice K R Shriram last year in one such arbitration matter
The court, after hearing their counsel, Milind Sathe and Virag Tulzapurkar and Zal Andhyarujina for the Kanpur group as well as the Kolkata group's counsel Dinyar Madon who raised preliminary objections to the maintainability of the appeal, held that execution orders were not appealable as if it was a decreeThe HC had last directed the Kolkata group to deposit Rs 46 crore which it did
An arbitrator had in 2008 divided the family properties of the Singhanias three-ways between the Mumbai, Kolkata and Kanpur branches of the family
The Mumbai bungalow was to go to the Kolkata group and some Kanpur properties to the Mumbai group
