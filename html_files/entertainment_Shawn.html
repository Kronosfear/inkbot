  Found this gem deep in the iPhone videos..lol i love the "killed that" face we both make at the end @camila_cabello A post shared by Shawn Mendes (@shawnmendes) on Mar 27, 2017 at 5:42am PDT

“We’re just really close friends,” Mendes — who is currently on his Illuminate World Tour — said of his bond with Cabello at the time.
“I get why people are interested in my love life, but I don’t want to give people that piece of me because it is the most important part,” she said in her Latina magazine cover story.Sixers center Shawn Long, taking a shot against the Celtics on March 19, 2017, has shown he belongs in the NBA.
Even if we just wrote for other people, I would be happy to do that because she’s such a thrill to write with and work with.”

For her part, “Bad Things” singer Cabello — who is preparing her first solo album since exiting Fifth Harmony in December — recently said she’ll never discuss her love life.
"He knows how to play," said Henderson, who is in his eighth NBA season.
"I just have to do what I do - that's just play hard," Long said of his role.
"He's an NBA player, man," Henderson said.
“Found this gem deep in the iPhone videos,” Mendes — who has cited Sheeran as an inspiration — captioned the clip.
NEW YORK - When he talked about Shawn Long, veteran Gerald Henderson got straight to the point about his 76ers teammate, who spent the bulk of his rookie season in the NBA Development League.
