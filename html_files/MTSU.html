Upshaw says thoughts of the finality are there, “When we go to play [Thursday], I’ll have a little bit of that thought, that this might be my last game, but once the ball gets up in the air and we get to be going up and down the court all of those nerves will be gone.”

Win or lose, Upshaw has already cemented his place in Blue Raider history with 98 wins in four years, including last year’s massive upset of Michigan State.

MILWAUKEE — Ten-year-old Eli Deml, an autistic trumpet player who plays alongside MTSU's pep band, is headed to the NCAA tournament.
Head coach Kermit Davis has grown to respect the man as much as the player and agreed with Dixon’s assessment, “He’s going to go down not only as one of the greatest players in the history of Conference USA, but one of the very best players in our school history.
"I am elated he will be playing with us; we aren't a complete pep band without him," pep band director Allen Kennedy said.
