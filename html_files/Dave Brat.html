  At the end of last week, Murphy, the top Democrat on the House Contracting and Workforce Subcommittee despite being a freshman, paired up with U.S. Rep. Dave Brat, R-Va., and U.S. Rep. Steve Knight, R-Calif., to unveil a proposal amending the Small Business Act to give “clear job description to Commercial Marketing Representatives at the Small Business Administration and help small businesses better compete for subcontracts.”

Brat, who made national headlines for beating former U.S. House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Va., in a major upset, chairs the House Economic Growth, Tax, and Capital Access Subcommittee and is the sponsors of the bill.
I look forward to working in a bipartisan manner with my colleagues on the House Small Business Committee to pass this important clarifying legislative language to ensure small businesses can continue to provide value goods and services to Americans.”

“Small businesses are the backbone of our economy and it is imperative that we reduce barriers to accessing contracting opportunities,” said Knight.
“I applaud Representatives Brat and Murphy for introducing this bipartisan measure that would provide clarity for our Commercial Market Representatives as they help our small business compete for subcontracts.”

The bill was sent to the House Small Business Committee on Friday.
As a member of the House Small Business Committee and as ranking member of the Subcommittee on Contracting and Workforce, I’ll continue to fight for small businesses in central Florida and across our country.”

“We must work to ensure Commercial Marketing Representatives (CMRs) require prime contractors comply with subcontracting requirements,” Brat said.
“The federal government spends about $500 billion a year on federal contracts for goods and services, and Congress must ensure our nation’s small businesses have a fair shot at federal contracts and subcontracts,” Murphy said when they brought the bill out.
