  A Kenyan-born lawyer placed in an unwinnable position on the Senate ballot paper at last year's election is expected to enter Parliament after the High Court ruled former Family First senator Bob Day was ineligible to be elected
Adelaide's Lunchtime Newsbyte 5/4/17 0:48 High Court rules Bob Day was not validly elected Man killed when his ute hit a stone wall and split Fire has damaged a unit at Davoren Park Car dumped after northern suburbs police chase Almost $1 billion worth of ice seized in police raid Josh Jenkins in doubt to play Saturday night Showdown Adelaide's Lunchtime Newsbyte 5/4/17

Why court asked to rule

The court was asked to rule on whether Mr Day’s links to the company that owned his taxpayer-funded electorate office in Kent Town breached the Constitution
THE High Court of Australia has ruled that former Family First senator Bob Day breached the constitution and was therefore incapable of sitting as a senator
"Family First, like the other parties and individuals who stood for the Senate at the last election, will now await for the decision of the Electoral Commission after a single judge of the High Court gives directions as to the recount</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" align="center"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Bob Dylan’s Triplicate is today’s album of the day on BBC 6 Music.

Mr Day's vacancy will be filled by a special recount of the Senate ballot papers, with Family First's second candidate Lucy Gichuhi expected to replace him
Ms Gichuhi, who said she would be an "independent-minded" senator, is expected to be a less predictable supporter of the Turnbull government than Mr Day, an economically dry former Liberal Party candidate who usually sided with the Coalition
South Australian Family First leader Dennis Hood told Fairfax Media the party was "absolutely satisfied" with Ms Gichuhi's eligibility after its lawyers closely examined the matter
But in their reasoning, the High Court justices found the argument that Family First's votes should be disregarded would "constitute a most serious distortion of the real intention of many thousands of voters" - particularly those who voted for the party above the line
