The Yogi Adityanath government in Uttar Pradesh is planning to negotiate with banks for a soft loan of Rs 2,000 crore to sugar mills that have failed to clear cane dues over the past three seasons, offering itself as a guarantor for the loan, to fulfill the BJP’s poll promise of ensuring timely payment to cane farmers
The note also states that in the event of the sovereign guarantee being granted, those mills, which use their absence of CCL as an excuse for not paying cane dues, will also be forced to pay their dues by either taking a loan on the backing of the state guarantee or manage it through their own resources
“We request that in order to get these sugar mills soft loans from banks, the state government would be needed to provide a sovereign guarantee of `2,000 crore,” the note said
But later fake currency notes with better quality paper started coming in, Rijiju saidStating that the government has adopted many new security features in the new currency notes, Rijiju said, "I can assure the House and the country that now no one can copy 100 per cent, as we have indigenous design and extra features
If the state government agrees to give sovereign guarantee to these mills, they would be able to get loans from the banks easily, which would help get their cane dues cleared on time
Batting for these sugar mills, the proposal states that the sugar mills are keen to pay off cane dues but are not able to do so because of their poor financial condition and absence of bank facility or cash credit
