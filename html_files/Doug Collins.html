(Teddy Greenstein/Chicago Tribune) Northwestern coach Chris Collins reacts after it was announced the team was selected into its first-ever NCAA tournament on March 12, 2017.
The fathers don't know each other well — Homer made his mark in coaching at Valparaiso while Doug worked in the NBA — but enjoyed each other's company last year when Bryce brought his Valparaiso team to scrimmage Northwestern.
"There is something to being the first," Doug Collins said, explaining what drew Chris to Evanston after 13 years as a Duke assistant.
In the same manner Doug finds a way to be around Northwestern as much as possible, Homer and his wife, Janet, moved to Nashville last fall to be closer to their grandkids — Bryce hired Casey Shaw, married to Bryce's sister, Dana, on his staff after taking over last March.
