  The Daily Mail responded to the criticism, saying it often commented on the appearance of male politicians "including Cameron's waistline, Osborne's hair, Corbyn's clothes - and even Boris's legs".
A spokesperson for the Daily Mail said Sarah Vine's piece had "appeared in an 84-page paper packed with important news and analysis, a front page exclusive on cost-cutting in the NHS and a health supplement devoted to women's health issues".This video shows the chilling moment a maid is caught on camera appearing to be possessed by evil spirits.
A spokesman for the first minister said the focus on Mrs May's and Ms Sturgeon's legs was "slightly surprising" when they had met to discuss Brexit and a second Scottish referendum.

The Daily Mail piece was part of more than a page of coverage on the two leaders' appearance.
The tabloid was scorned for focusing on the prime minister's and first minister's legs during talks on Brexit and a second Scottish referendum.

Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson contributed a shot of her "bit short" pins in the froth of a hot tub to the debate.
'Foetus in a jar'

Ms Vine also defended the piece saying the Mail was a tabloid newspaper and "that's what we do".
Ms Vine added: "There was quite a lot of serious stuff about this meeting and then we saw the picture and thought, 'Gosh, look at those kitten heels and look at those fabulous legs, let's write some words about it.'"
