Questions have been raised about why a leaked report detailing the drug culture inside the West Coast Eagles in the mid 2000s was kept secret for almost a decade.
West Coast to face more rounds of rain, mountain snow through end of week

By Faith Eherts, AccuWeather meteorologist March 21, 2017, 2:31:12 PM EDT



After rounds of storms and high-elevation snow during the start of the week, Californians will only get a brief glimpse of the sun before more storms roll into the state through the end of the week.
"Those most hurt by today's Herald Sun story are now Essendon coach John Worsfold, then the coach of the Eagles, and CEO of West Coast Trevor Nisbett, for clearly Judge Gillard felt they did not act strongly enough on compelling evidence," he said.
“Another storm will move into the West Coast to end the week and lead to a wet commute to and from work from Seattle to San Francisco on Friday,” said AccuWeather Meteorologist Brett Rathbun.
The 83-page report documents one of the best and worst chapters in West Coast's history, with the club winning the 2006 premiership but also forced to deal with a string of off-field problems.
