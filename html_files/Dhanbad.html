A FORMER deputy mayor of Dhanbad, a nephew of late coal mafia leader-turned-politician Surya Deo Singh, was shot dead along with three aides in Dhanbad district on Tuesday evening.
Stating that police are probing the “exact manner in which assailants intercepted the vehicle”, an officer said, “The vehicle is said to have slowed down near a speed breaker when the firing began.” He added that the assailants must have had clear information about the route Singh was taking, as they took the chance of intercepting them on a very busy stretch.
A special investigation team will be constituted for the case.” Neeraj Singh’s younger brother Eklavya Singh, also a Congress leader, is the current deputy mayor of Dhanbad.
Motorcycle-borne asssailants on Tuesday opened indiscriminate firing on Dhanbad’s former deputy mayor Neeraj Singh, his driver and two others, killing all four of them.
According to police, Neeraj Singh, in his mid-forties and the deputy mayor between 2005 and 2015, was returning home in an SUV — a Mahindra Scorpio – with two private guards (Ashok Yadav and Goltu) and his driver Munna when it was intercepted near Steel Gate intersection, around 7.15 pm.
