AARON HAMILTON:





Racing Bet of the Day (Sandown)





Aaron’s got two horses to follow at Sandown and is expecting each to prove hard to beat
"When it gets a bit closer (to the end of the season) I might start getting a bit more serious thinking about it, but at the moment I'll just relax and if it happens it happens, but at the moment just going to keep doing what I'm doing"
Mertens took his season's tally to 48 winners with victories aboard See Line Woman and Single Note
Beau Mertens continued his stunning run with another city double at Ladbrokes Park (Sandown) on Wednesday, but he is adamant his eyes are not on the Victorian Metropolitan Jockeys' Premiership
