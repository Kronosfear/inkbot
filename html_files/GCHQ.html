  A Royal Charter is all about raising the profile of an information security professional – they’re not just IT people Chris Ensor, NCSC

They come to work for us because it’s public service ethos but it’s also deeply fascinating, you get to play with great technology and learn all sorts of secret stuff which is absolutely brilliantGetting people to understand cyber security has been the biggest challenge for outgoing GCHQ director Robert Hannigan since he took charge at the intelligence agency in 2014.

“The one criticism has been that we didn’t say enough about it – and they were correct, so we have tried to put that right in recent years, which has been a big change.” Hannigan, who, in an article in the Financial Times in November 2014, criticised big US tech companies for aiding terror groups by not co-operating sufficiently with intelligence agencies, said that although this continues to be a problem, things have improved.
“People may not like bits of it, but it is absolutely transparent and involves judges in a new way, which is a huge step forward,” he said, echoing the view of former GCHQ head David Ormand, who told a security conference in London last October that the UK would be the first country in Europe to bring the secret surveillance activities of the state fully under modern rule of law.
