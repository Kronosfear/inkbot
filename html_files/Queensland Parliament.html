  Gay panic defence scrapped by Queensland Parliament after lobbying by Catholic priest

Updated

Lobbyist Catholic priest Paul Kelly has welcomed Queensland Parliament's move to scrap what he called a "homophobic, archaic and outdated law" that allowed gay panic as a partial defence for murder.
"If Gerard Baden-Clay's, if the appeal hadn't been overturned by the High Court and manslaughter had stayed and he was charged under this new offence, it certainly could have meant that he would have served more time in prison," Ms D'Ath said.
"Just as we have committed to no body, no parole, I hope that this is one of those provisions that if there is an unlawful killing, if it was an accident, that people will think twice about in any way touching the body and interfering with evidence, knowing that it now could lead to further imprisonment," Ms D'Ath said.
"It sends a message Queensland's criminal code does not condone or encourage violence against the lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans, intersex community," Mrs D'Ath said.
"I'm absolutely thrilled that the 290,000 signatures on my change.org petition and support from Queensland Attorney-General Yvette D'Ath led to the axing of this homophobic, archaic and outdated law," Father Kelly said.
