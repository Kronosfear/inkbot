  The day after Brooks re-signed with the club on a two-year deal, Gould, the Penrith Panthers’ supremo, declared star player agent Isaac Moses secretly believes Brooks and Mitchell Moses may need to be separated in order for them to reach their potential
He said he expects Cronk, turning 34 this year, will look back at the end of this season with the Storm and be satisfied with his career, rather than feel the need to build something from scratch in SydneyBrisbane Broncos v Sydney Roosters – 750pm (AEST), Thursday, April 6 @ Suncorp Stadium

Broncos: 1
Tigers withdrew his offer due to salary cap @9NewsSyd — Danny Weidler (@Danny_Weidler) April 5, 2017

The @WestsTigers say that they may re-visit the offer to Mitch Moses - but Tedesco and Woods are the priorities
Whether or not he can convince them that they need to be together in the long term”

It comes as Gould also chastised the Tigers over a report indicating the club has tabled an offer to star fullback James Tedesco worth $4</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" align="center"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Mitch Moses management: we&#39;ll get you the best price, no other SIGNIFICANT half is on the market...

But if you’re managing a salary can properly, given the salary cap offers that we’ve had from the NRL going forward, I can’t see a $1 million player in the game if you’re going to take it out of the salary cap
He said there is currently not one player in the game that deserves to be taking up more than $1 million per season on an NRL club salary cap
