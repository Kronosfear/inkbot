WASHINGTON, April 4 (Reuters) - Top US labor leader Richard Trumka on Tuesday blasted the Trump administration's initial plan to revamp the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), calling it "very timid"


CTVNewsca Staff





Former Progressive Conservative prime minister Brian Mulroney will have a seat at the table at an upcoming Liberal cabinet meeting to discuss the North American Free Trade Agreement, the pivotal deal he helped negotiate more than 20 years ago that now faces an uncertain future
Speaking before an audience at the National Press Club, Trumka said that the administration could leave the "most oppressive pieces" of NAFTA in place despite President Donald Trump's harsh criticism of the 23-year-old trade deal with Mexico and Canada
Other participants at the Thursday meeting include Derek Burney, the former Canadian ambassador to Washington who helped negotiate NAFTA, and current Canadian ambassador to Washington David MacNaughton
But the AFL-CIO has long been critical of NAFTA and Trumka, the labor federation's president, met with Trump after the election</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" align="center"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Mulroney tapped for NAFTA negotiations Grand &amp; Toy shares up as plain brown envelope sales expected to grow <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/cdnpoli?src=hash">#cdnpoli</a> <a href="https://t.co/zta7ID79c3">https://t.co/zta7ID79c3</a></p>&mdash; ReadyToLaunch (@DrArleigh) <a href="https://twitter.com/DrArleigh/status/849603402988494848">April 5, 2017</a></blockquote>

Trumka said there are dozens of changes to the trade pact that unions favor, such as making its labor standards fully enforceable and scrapping the entire dispute resolution system for antidumping and antisubsidy cases
The discussion is expected to centre around the future of NAFTA -- a trade agreement that US President Donald Trump intends to renegotiate
Mulroney helped negotiate NAFTA back in 1990 with George H W Bush and Mexican President Carlos Salinas, and Liberal officials hope to tap his knowledge on the inner workings of the deal
