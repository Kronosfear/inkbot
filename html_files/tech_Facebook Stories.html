Facebook Stories will look exactly like Instagram Stories with little circular profile photo of the user and their friends appearing on top of the News Feed.
According to TechCrunch report, Facebook Stories will look exactly like Instagram Stories with little circular profile photo of the user and their friends appearing on top of the News Feed.
"We hope that with the new Facebook camera, Stories and Direct, it will be easier than ever to see the world through each other's eyes, and we can't wait to see the photos and videos you create," the company's blog post said.
Facebook has reportedly started rolling out Stories, a feature similar to Instagram Stories, for its users in Chile, Greece and Vietnam.
As for Facebook Stories, users will be able to share multiple photos and videos as part of a visual collection on top of News Feed.
Of course, Facebook Stories is a rip-off of Snapchat Stories, one that features photos that disappear in 24 hours.
To add a story, users will need to click on the Your Story icon in the Stories bar on top of the News Feed.
