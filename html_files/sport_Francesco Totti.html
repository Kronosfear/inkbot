  The gaffer

Five league titles with Milan and Real Madrid, not to mention a Champions League win with the former, meant Fabio Capello was one of Europe’s most highly regarded coaches.

Remembering the perfect 3-5-2 that won Francesco Totti his only league title

James Robinson

Robert Huth has triple the amount of league titles as Francesco Totti.
The quartet combined for 49 league goals, with Batistuta finishing as Roma’s top scorer but trailing to Hernan Crespo, Andriy Shevchenko and Enrico Chiesa in the battle to be Serie A’s Capocannoniere.
Let’s remember that one, special, league title success in 2001, achieved using an almost perfect 3-5-2 formation.
Zanetti would interchange with Brazilian Emerson throughout the season, protecting the back three and dropping in when Cafu and Candela streamed forward.
Brazilian A.C. Zago, Argentinian Walter Samuel and Frenchman Jonathan Zebina combined for a back three boasting pace, power and ability on the ball.
The 30-year-old, one of five Brazilians at Roma, played 31 times in the league, more than making up for the lack of wingers in Capello’s squad.
The Roma and Italy legend is 40-years-old and still contracted with his boyhood club, though he has started just one Serie A game this term.
