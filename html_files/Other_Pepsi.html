  This commercial makes me want to gouge my eyes out lmao pictwittercom/M6eevDa9gj — karla (@spiritb0red) April 4, 2017

The “second image” referenced above image was captured at last summer’s demonstrations in Baton Rouge, where protestors were reacting to the shooting death of Alton Sterling, a black man, by a white police officer
Many of the recent protests across America have followed the deaths of black men at the hands of white officers, and a famous person handing a hunky police officer a Pepsi doesn’t seem like it’s going to solve this significant issue, despite what this “short film” might want us to believe
like them or not, half the protests in the last year have been against police — jack wagner (@GrimmKardashian) April 4, 2017

Pepsi, what were you thinking?
As one observant Twitter user notes, it looks like the company is trying to recreate the most iconic photograph to come out of a protest in recent years</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" align="center"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">What are all these Pepsi and black jokes about?</p>&mdash; God (@tinyybev) <a href="https://twitter.com/tinyybev/status/849603535071318017">April 5, 2017</a></blockquote>

So, what we have here is a two-minute “short film” — Pepsi’s words, not ours — in which a bunch of millennials have taken to the street for some protest or another
The advertising pros responsible here likely thought they were producing a modern version of Coca-Cola’s famous “Hilltop” ad — which Don Draper might have created — but they missed the mark by, oh, several million miles
Oh, it seems Kendall Jenner just happens to be doing a photo shoot right next to the protest route
The ad’s climactic moment comes when, after throwing off her blonde wig and wiping away her lipstick, Jenner quickly joins the march of protestors and moves to the front of the pack as the crowd nears a wall of hostile-looking policemen
