  Ian Paisley Jnr, who as a junior minister worked alongside his father and the Sinn Fein veteran during their time jointly leading the Stormont executive, said he had gone from viewing Mr McGuinness as the "godfather of the IRA" to considering him a personal friend.
John Eaglesham, whose father - a postman and part-time soldier - was shot dead by the IRA in 1978, said: "People say about what he has done for the peace process - they seem to forget that for a very, very long time he wasn't part of the solution he was part of the problem, in fact he was the main part of the problem."
But Stephen Gault, whose father Samuel died in the IRA's notorious Poppy Day bombing in Enniskillen in 1987, said he would remember Mr McGuinness only as a "terrorist".
During their time in office as first and deputy first minister, Mr Paisley and Mr McGuinness earned the nickname the "Chuckle brothers".
Prime Minister Theresa May, Irish Taoiseach Enda Kenny, ex-US president Bill Clinton and former Democratic Unionist first ministers Peter Robinson and Arlene Foster all praised Mr McGuinness's contribution to peace.
