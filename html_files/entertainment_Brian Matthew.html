  Michigan State didn't get that next-level quarterback play that's been critical to the program's success since Dantonio's arrival in 2007
Mr Matthew was one of Radio 2’s first DJs, and has presented Sounds of the 60s since 1990EAST LANSING, Mich — Michigan State quarterback Brian Lewerke is "the guy right now"

“I also think our other quarterbacks are good players, too, but right now he’s the guy," Dantonio confirmed afterward
"Every time he takes a snap in an environment where there are people there or something of that nature he’s going to get better and better and better</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" align="center"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Brian Matthew, former host of Sounds of the 60s, dies aged 88 <a href="https://t.co/1YBTUF18AE">https://t.co/1YBTUF18AE</a></p>&mdash; Pickles U Fat Get (@torysmasher) <a href="https://twitter.com/torysmasher/status/849603394629251072">April 5, 2017</a></blockquote>

"He’s much improved," Dantonio said
If Michigan State is going to bounce back on the field in 2017, then Lewerke will have to show signs of that next-level play that helped make the program successful in the past
"He’s still going to mess up signals, and call the wrong play when it’s supposed to be a different play, those type of things which are elementary mistakes that he will get past
