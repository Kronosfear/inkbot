  Philadelphia's top prosecutor was charged Tuesday with taking more than $100,000 in luxury gifts, Caribbean trips and cash, often in exchange for official favors that included help with a court case, according to a bribery and extortion indictment unsealed Tuesday.The indictment caps a nearly two-year investigation into Philadelphia District Attorney Seth Williams' financial affairs.
They also said he took $7,000 for helping a business owner friend meet with an airport police official in an attempt to avoid enhanced screening when returning to the U.S. from foreign trips.Williams, who was known to frequent cigar bars and dine at the city's ritzy Union League private club, also spent $20,000 in funds earmarked for a relative's nursing home care, the indictment said.Williams was spending Tuesday huddled with family, a spokesman said, and was expected to surrender and be arraigned on the charges Wednesday.
"During my tenure, I have made regrettable mistakes in my personal life and my personal, financial life that cast an unnecessary shadow over the district attorney's office," Williams said during that announcement.
Williams, a Democrat and career prosecutor who makes $175,000 in the top job, has said he ran into financial trouble after a divorce and while paying private school tuition for his daughters.The indictment described gifts that included trips he took with his then-girlfriend to a Dominican Republic resort, where they stayed in a presidential suite; a custom $3,400 sofa; and a used Jaguar convertible, with insurance coverage to match.In exchange, authorities said, Williams offered to help a friend's friend seek a reduced jail sentence in a criminal case.
"My poor judgment caused distractions, and made the already difficult job of my ... staff even more difficult," Williams said.During his seven-year tenure, his office filed the first charges against several Roman Catholic priests and earned a trial conviction against the first U.S. church official ever charged over the handling of priest sex-abuse complaints.
