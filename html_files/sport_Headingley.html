The plan includes a new south stand on the rugby ground and a new joint stand overlooking both the rugby pitch and cricket ground.

An investor prepared to invest £35m in Leeds' Headingley stadium has been found, the city council says.
The club plans to start "stripping out" the stand at the end of May and work should be finished before the 2019 cricket season, allowing the ground to host games in that year's world cup, said Mr Arthur.
The details of the latest investment are still to be discussed at a meeting of senior councillors in April.Headingley's shared stand is due for redevelopment

Yorkshire's chief executive says there is real urgency to address a funding shortfall that could see Headingley lose international cricket.
Gary Hetherington, chief executive of rugby league side Leeds Rhinos that is also to invest about £5m, said it was the sort of decision "made once every 100 years" and there was "still some work to be done".
The council had withdrawn a £4m grant from the work, leaving Yorkshire County Cricket Club facing being unable to host international matches after 2019.
Mr Arthur said the new deal "would safeguard international cricket at Headingley for the foreseeable future".
We are working hard to try and solve the situation, but fundamentally my priority is to maintain the status of Yorkshire County Cricket Club and if we have to do without international cricket then so be it."
