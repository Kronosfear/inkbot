‚ÄúThe industry must halt these endless branch closure programs and open their eyes to what these closures are doing to rural communities, their disabled customers and the small business customers who depend on access to a local branch‚Äù

The news comes less than 24 hours after the firm announced a huge overhaul of its network - with plans to "shrink" some stores down to just two members of staff as the brand adapts to 'digital banking'</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" align="center"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">No wonder Lloyds Bank are closing branches.
