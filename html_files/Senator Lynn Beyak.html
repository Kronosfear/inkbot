"The senator has stated unequivocally, many times over the years, in noting certain positive aspects of residential schools, as also recorded in the Truth and Reconciliation Commission report, one can never excuse or minimize the suffering that victims have experienced," Beyak said in her statement, written in the third person.

In her first public remarks since CBC News reported her comments more than a week ago, Beyak said she has many Indigenous friends and those that read her speech "recognize her knowledge, compassion and expertise" on the First Nations file.
In a separate meeting of the Senate's Aboriginal Peoples committee last month, Beyak said, "I was disappointed in the Truth and Reconciliation Commission's report in that it didn't focus on the good.
