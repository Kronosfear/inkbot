  "Minutes later he had left the Assembly.Vijay Sardesai, chief of regional party Goa Forward, has alleged that the Congress had attempted to contact him as the party scrambled to ensure a defeat for Mr Parrikar in today's trust vote.Digvijaya Singh claimed till last evening that the Congress had the numbers to stall the BJP, but by this morning the party had clearly given up as Mr Sardesai and other allies reconfirmed their allegiance to Mr Parrikar, who resigned as the country's defence minister earlier this week to return to Goa.New Delhi: Vishwajit P Rane, the Congress MLA from Valpoi and the leader of opposition in the outgoing Goa Assembly on Wednesday wrote a letter to party’s Vice-President Rahul Gandhi and questioned mismanagement in the state.

It would have been 17 had Mr Rane stayed and voted.This morning as he headed into the Goa assembly, Mr Rane said he would vote for the Congress, stating, "As of now I am with the Congress, why are you asking me anything...
"Mr Rane's presence would not have affected the result of the trust vote; Chief Minister Parrikar sailed through with 22 votes in his favour, one more than he needed in the 40-member house.
