The projects on the river Ganga will boost the economies of West Bengal, Jharkhand, Bihar and Uttar Pradesh.\n\nUnder the National Waterways Act of 2016, the government has committed to developing 111 designated national waterways. Of these, NWs-1, 2, & 3 are partially operational. The national waterways would not only reduce logistics costs, but also lessen congestion on the road and rail networks, having a multiplier effect on the Indian economy.\n\nWork on NW-1 had been pending since 1990 due to hurdles posed by siltation. The shipping ministry has finally pushed the development of the Haldia-Varanasi stretch (1620 km) with projects for construction of multi-modal terminals at Varanasi, Haldia and Sahibganj, strengthening of the river navigation system, conservancy works, and development of information systems and night navigation facilities, besides construction of a navigational lock at Farakka.\n\nAmitabh Verma, till recently the chairman of the Inland Waterways Authority of India (IWAI), says \u201cthe Prime Minister\u2019s project monitoring group is looking at the work on a day-to-day basis and all projects have to be completed in a time-bound manner.\u201d\n\nFull operationalisation of the Haldia-Varanasi stretch would allow the navigation of vessels with a capacity of 1,500-2,000 tonnes, he says. The development of the waterway, expected to cost Rs 4,200 crore, has been taken up with assistance from the World Bank.\n\nConstruction work for the multi-modal terminals at Haldia, Sahibganj and Varanasi has commenced. The terminal at Haldia would become a hub for transportation of cargo to the North East. The terminal, according to Verma, has already received a commitment of 5.92 million tonne per annum of cargo once it becomes operational in 2018. IWAI also plans to build a new navigational lock and modernise the existing one at Farakka.\n\nThe terminal at Sahibganj in Bihar would further the transportation of coal to power plants. The terminal is expected to be operational by 2018. This project, according to IWAI officials, would help in the de-siltation of the river.\n\nYou May Also Want To Watch:\n\nIn Bihar, the IWAI also envisages investment in terminals at Kalughat and Gaighat, ferry and RO-RO services and dredging. The Kalughat terminal would boost transportation of cargo from Kolkata to Nepal, reducing costs by 26% and 13% compared to the railways and road, respectively. An analysis by the World Bank has concluded that the project would lead to extensive economic and social development along the banks of the Ganga in Bihar.\n\nWork on the multi-modal terminal at Varanasi (Ramnagar) commenced in August 2016. Estimated to cost R170 crore, it is\n\nexpected to be operational by August 2018.\n\nThe NW-1 projects are expected to create 1,60,000 direct and indirect jobs, Nitin Gadkari, union minister of shipping, has said. Besides being cheaper to develop than railways and roadways, waterways cost 25-30 paise per km of transport, as against R1 for railways and R1.50 for roadways. From the abysmal 3.5% at present, IWAI is aiming to increase waterway transportation of cargo in India to 15% by 2019. Even this would be low compared to countries like China, South Korea, UK, Germany, France where it is in the range of 35%-40%.",

        "body1": "Have you ever learned something the hard way? Gone out on your own and fallen flat on your face? I\u2019ve not only done it once, but several times with dividend investing.\n\nI still remember sitting there, going over one of stock lists when I noticed a fairly popular company was down by about 20%. As I looked into the details, the size of the price drop seemed overblown\u2026 and like a good buying opportunity. So, I picked up some shares because \"Mr. Market\" (From Chapter 2 of this story) seemed to be having one of those days.\n\nUnfortunately, a few days later the news worsened and this falling knife cut deep. It dropped another 50% from where I purchased it and to top it off, the company completely eliminated their dividend. A double whammy.\n\nIn a similar case, I purchased some shares of a company that was paying a 10% dividend. It had a decent track record of payments, and yes there was some chatter about a potential dividend decrease, but that had been public knowledge for years.\n\nWell just my luck, a few months after owning it, the dividend was cut in half. As a result, the value of the shares dropped by about 60%. Ouch!\n\nDiscussing investment mistakes isn\u2019t anywhere near as much fun as sharing success stories but there are key lessons for investors to walk away with.\n\nFirst, owning individual stocks isn\u2019t riskier than other forms of investing if you take steps to manage it. One consideration to keep in mind is to limit the value of any one holding to 3-5% of the portfolio\u2019s value. In other words, if you have $100,000 to invest, each holding should be between $3,000 - $5,0000 in value. This will ensure that if any one company drops by 50% or 60%, the damage to your overall savings won\u2019t be catastrophic. This form of diversification is referred to as managing single stock risk.\n\nAlong the same lines, there are 11 different sectors in the S&P 500. By owning at least 8 of them, investors can minimize the impact that a downturn in one or more areas of the economy has on their portfolio. Sectors can move in and out of fashion without much notice. One year banking and healthcare could provide the most return, only to drop to the bottom of the list as utilities and energy outperform. By spreading their risks across 8 or more sectors, investors can avoid costly concentrations or trying to guess which sectors will do the best or worst in any given year.\n\nAnother important ingredient to understand is a company\u2019s payout ratio. This number lets an investor know what percentage of company profits that it returns to its shareholders. The lower the percentage, the more likely a company will be able to maintain their payments. For example, assume Company A has a payout ratio of 40% and Company B has a payout ratio of 89%. If there is a slowdown in the economy, sector, or some negative company news, which company will be able to continue paying their dividend if profits go down?\n\nTrack records are also important when it comes to dividend investing. Nearly every time I stepped outside of tried and true companies with a history of increasing their dividend payments each year, I struck out. Yes, I may have made a few extra bucks at the get-go, but it always seemed to come back and bite me. Fact of the matter is, there is no benefit to owning mediocre companies when you can own high-quality ones that reward you for sticking around.\n\nFinally, I think it\u2019s important for each investor to understand the concept of homegrown dividends. This is when you buy a dividend stock and sell it for a profit, effectively creating cash flow equivalent to one of two years worth of dividend payments, for example. It turns out that many investors develop the means for evaluating and buying dividend stocks but forget to figure out what would cause them to sell them. While there are no perfect rules, simply establishing a price point in which to re-evaluate a given stock can help. For example, when the stock price goes up by double the annual dividend, it can serve as a good point in time to make sure the reasons you bought it remain intact.\n\nOverall, I have come to truly love and appreciate the art of investing in individual securities. From the point when mutual funds and annuities first failed me, to understanding the ups and downs of Mr. Market, and from the mistakes I made with falling knives, the entire journey has been fun and educational to say the least. I hope you found it valuable too!\n\nRetirement today is more about you than your money, take our retirement priorities quiz now, & then access our free non-financial guides & resources at RetirementProject.org",

Meri Pyaari Bindu Chapter 3: Ayushmann Khurrana has a small role in this clip but Parineeti Chopra doesn\u2019t fail to amaze us.\n\n\u2018How would I be a singer with a name like Bindu Shankar Narayan,\u2019 Bindu aks Abhi. But his woes are more heart-rending for his name is Abhimanyu Bubla Roy. Confused about what we are talking about here? Well, it is the innocent romance of Bindu (Parineeti Chopra) and Abhi (Ayushmann Khurrana) and we have just reached chapter 3 of Meri Pyaari Bindu.\n\nParineeti Chopra is debuting as a singer with Meri Pyaari Bindu. Her character Bindu is a budding vocalist who wants to be \u2018Kalkatte Ki Madonna\u2019 but takes her inspiration from Lata Mangeshkar. She claims that she would have millions of fans one day, but to practice, Bindu relies on her best buddy Abhimanyu, who is a bad singer. Interestingly, in reality, Ayushmann is an amazing singer with a list of hit numbers to his credit.\n\nMaybe this is what he meant when he mentioned how hard it was for him to unlearn singing. The actor said, \u201cI had to unlearn singing to play the character in the film. Since I am playing a writer who does not know how to sing, I actually had to act that up!\u201d However, dear Ayushmann, you just cannot go wrong with those musical notes even though you tried pretty hard.\n\nCheck out Meri Pyaari Bindu Chapter 3:\n\nThis video takes you on a ride through iconic musical eras of Bollywood.

It's understood that Meaney will begin training for the role immediately and will even receive a small puppy that studio executives will then viciously murder (they won't really, but they'll make it look like they did) in order to help Meaney get into character.\n\nSpeaking on his decision to exit the role of John Wick, Reeves said that it was time for a change. \"Personally, it's tough trying to balance playing a cold-blooded assassin and being an actual cold-blooded assassin. Colm's a great guy and I loved him in The Commitments, so this all works out. Excuse me, I have to go stab someone in the face with a pencil.\"\n\nIt's also believed that Reeves has to return to the Fountain of Youth every 129 years to rejuvenate himself, and that taking on John Wick: Chapter 3 would have clashed with it.\n\nAlthough Meaney was unavailable for comment, his representatives said that his experience playing Chief Miles O'Brien in Star Trek: The Next Generation and Star Trek: Deep Space Nine has more than prepared him for the role. \"He was acting alongside Patrick Stewart for nearly four years. That's basically the same thing as being able to jump over people and shooting them at the same time,\" said one industry insider.\n\nJohn Wick: Chapter 3 is expected in Irish cinemas on April 1st, 2019.\n\nVia Totally Reputable Source",

        "body1": "Jio made a not-so-surprising announcement on Friday. The company extended its Prime membership deadline to April 15. This means users can continue using the free services till April 15. The company said that out of its 100 million free users, more 70 million users have already registered for the membership.\n\nAlongside the extension of deadline, Reliance chairman Mukesh Ambani also announced the launch of one more new offer-the Summer Surprise. March 31 was a transitional date for company as it saw the end of its the then going Happy New Offer and start of Summer Surprise offer.\n\nWhat happens now? While the company calls this new offer as the largest and easy mode of transition from paid to free services in history, the fact is that it has only confused the \"poor\" Jio users. They have many questions. Like what happens to the money that they have already invested in Prime subscription and plans below Rs 303? Well, we try and answer all these questions here.\n\nWhat is Jio Summer Surprise offer?\n\nReliance Jio has extended its free services for 3 more months as Jio Summer Surprise offer. Users get this offer only if they become a Jio prime member and recharge any prime plan above Rs 303 before April 15.\n\nAlso Read: End of free Jio, new Prime deadline, Summer Surprise offer: Read full text of Mukesh Ambani's letter\n\nWhat does Jio Summer Surprise offer to you?\n\nThe new Summer Surprise offer is basically a continuation of Happy new Year Offer with different FUP limits for different recharges. This means you get free unlimited calls, free SMSes and free 4G data with different data limits for the next three months.\n\nWhat if you take only Prime subscription and no recharge, are you then eligible for Summer Surprise?\n\nAlso Read: Jio extends Prime membership deadline to April 15, ends free service & offers Summer Surprise\n\nIn case you have paid only Rs 99 and made no other recharges, your number will continue working for a stipulated period of time and after that will be discontinued. To avail Summer Surprise offer, it is mandatory to recharge with a recharge plan of Rs 303 and above.\n\nWhat do you get in Rs 303 plan under Summer Surprise offer?\n\nIf you have recharged with 303 plan, then you will get 1 GB data per day until 30th June and your 303 plan will be activated from 1st July up to 28th July, 2017.\n\nWhat if you have already taken the Rs 149 plan?\n\nUsers who have taken the Rs 149 plan will not get the Summer Surprise offer although they are eligible to get one. You have to take Rs 303 or above plan to become a Summer Surprise subscriber. This Rs 149 plan will kept as voucher and activated after three months plus one more month of Rs 303 plan after the Summer Surprise offer ends.\n\nIn other words, this means that if you have taken the Prime membership and has a done a recharge of Rs 149, you should now do a recharge of Rs 303. This will give you the Summer Surprise offer, which will last until July 15. From July 16, you will get the Jio services through the Rs 303 plan, for which you paid in April. This will end on August 15. From August 16, you will get the services through the Rs 149, the plan that you have already bought.\n\nSo essentially, the idea here is that your existing Rs 149 will be used. But if you take the Summer Surprise offer, it will be used only in August.\n\nWhat does Summer Surprise offer under Rs 99+ Rs 499 plan?\n\nUnder this you get free unlimited calls, SMSes and 4G data with 2GB FUP limit.\n\nWhat if you've taken the plans like Rs 4999 or Rs 9999 that are for more than 90 days?\n\nThese plans will kick in after three months, until then you can continue using Jio free services till July 15.\n\nHow much in total do you have to pay for Summer Surprise offer?\n\nThe minimum amount required to avail the Summer Surprise offer is Rs 99 plus Rs 303. So in total Rs 402.\n\nAnd extra 100 GB for big spenders...\n\nThis is something Jio hasn't talked about much but there is also extra benefit under the Summer Surprise offer for people who are going to recharge with Rs 999 or more. These users will get extra 100 GB data for 3 months, above what they will get with the recharge plan. So this mean if a user recharges with Rs 999, not only he or she will get the Summer Surprise offer but will also get 100 GB above 60GB data that the plan provides. Essentially, this means in a month a user will theoretically end up getting little over 90GB data per month with Rs 999 plan, at least for first three months.",

But for Mumbaikar Sushil Narsian, what he half-suspected was a prank turned out to be a true story.\n\nNarsian was charged with a whopping Rs 149 crore bill for a simple Mumbai ride that should have cost a couple of hundred rupees at the most.\n\nHere's what happened.\n\nNarsian booked an Ola cab from where he stays in Mulund West to Vakola Market on April 1. He was assigned a cab. Unfortunately, the cabbie's mobile phone got switched off, and he wasn't able to find the residence of Narsian on Google Maps.\n\nTo Narsian the cab looked to be stationary on the Maps, and so he decided to walk towards it. On reaching the driver's location, he did not find the cab.\n\nWhat he did eventually find out was that the cab had been cancelled by the driver a while back, and he was charged a preposterous sum of Rs 149 crore for the trip he did not even take.\n\nHad Ola played the sickest of jokes with him, he wasn't sure, for he had only booked a journey of around 22 KMs, which would have roughly costed him Rs 200-250.\n\nEven the Rs 127 in his digital wallet linked to Ola had been debited.\n\n@SushilNarsian Thanks for pointing out the glitch, Sushil. We've corrected the issue at our end. Here's a small token of our gratitude. Pls check your DM pic.twitter.com/jxeJ3unlLD \u2014 Ola (@Olacabs) April 4, 2017\n\nHe complained to the cab-aggregator's social media team, and they instantly credited the Rs 127 from his account, and removed the Rs 149 crore bill that was charged to him.\n\n\"Initially, I thought it was an April Fools' prank,\" Narsian told NDTV.\n\nNarsian will also be given a discount for the next 25 rides he takes till May 31.\n\nEven though he faced a Rs 149 crore ordeal, he has become a mini celebrity in social media.\n\n\"Soon, you will be called for panel discussions on NDTV.

        "body2": "Announced last year in September, Jio made headlines for its free offers. All those free offers end now. In other words, Jio will become a paid service from April 1, that is tomorrow, because today Jio Happy New Year offer will end.\n\nSo in case you are using Jio SIM cards, what are the options in front of you? A lot has been reported about what happens next, after you take the Prime subscription or if you don't take the Prime subscription. Most of Jio users, by now, know what is Jio Prime and what all it offers. But for, those who still are little confused about Jio Prime postpaid, Jio Prime prepaid, non-prime postpaid plans and similar things, here are some answers.\n\nTake Jio Prime membership: This will get you entry into the Jio special membership club and that will give you access to special Jio plans. Needless to say, this also means you will be able to continue using Jio services. It costs Rs 99 for one year. Once you take Jio Prime membership, you will still have to subscribe to some monthly, weekly or a day plan.Use Jio without Prime: This is also possible but you will pay more for data and services. Plans are explained down in this article.\n\nDon't recharge after Prime subscription: The Jio SIM will continue to work. You will get SMS. You will receive calls. But you won't be able to make calls or send messages. This will work until 90 days. After that your SIM will be deactivated.\n\nNo Prime, no recharge: This will mean no service on your Jio SIM. If you don't recharge then after a stipulated period -- possibly 90 days -- your SIM will be deactivated.\n\nNow the plans...\n\nJio Prime postpaid plans: Reliance Jio offers three recharge plans to its Prime postpaid users. The three plans are- Rs 303, Rs 499 and Rs 999. Under Rs 303, you get unlimited free voice calls and SMSes, unlimited data, 30GB 4G data with 1GB per day limit and subscription to Jio apps. For Rs 499, you get unlimited free voice calls, SMses, 60GB 4G data with 2GB per day FUP. Rs 999 plan will get you unlimited voice calls, SMSes and 60GB 4G data with no FUP limits.\n\nJio non-Prime postpaid plans: Non-Prime members who have taken postpaid connection will also get the same three prices of plans but with different data limits. Rs 303 gives 2.5GB 4G data, Rs 499 gives 5GB data and finally the Rs 999 plan that offers 12.5GB.\n\nNote for Jio postpaid users: Bill will generated monthly. Also, Jio will keep a refundable amount of Rs 4000 as security deposit for the connection. Applicable taxes will be extra for all Postpaid tariffs plans.\n\nJio Prime prepaid plans: Jio offers total ten plans to its prepaid customers. However, the prime members have an advantage over the non-prime members. The Prepaid plans for Jio Prime members starts from Rs 19 and goes all the way up to Rs 9,999. Below are the details of these plans:\n\n-- Rs 19 plan: The pans has a 1 day validity and offers unlimited voice calls - 200MB 4G data.\n\n-- Rs 49 plan: You get unlimited free voice calling, SMSes and 600 MB 4G data. Validity is for three days.\n\n-- Rs 96 plan: This is a seven-day pack with free voice callings, SMSes and 7GB data with FUP 1GB per day.\n\n-- Rs 149 plan: You get unlimited free voice calling, SMSes and 2GB 4G data for 28 days.\n\n-- Rs 303 plan:This is 28 days valid pack that offers unlimited free voice calls, SMSes and 28GB 4G data with FUP limit of 1GB per day.\n\n-- Rs 499 plan: User gets unlimited free voice calling, SMSes and 56GB with FUP of 2GB a day for 28 days.\n\nAlso Read: Jio Prime offer to expire tomorrow, and here is what you gain or lose from it\n\n-- Rs 999 plan: Under this plan, the prime members get unlimited free voice calling, SMSes and 60GB 4G data. The plan is valid for 60 days.\n\n-- Rs 1999 plan: You get unlimited free voice calling, SMSes and 125GB 4G data with a pack validity of 90 days.\n\n-- Rs 4999 plan: There's unlimited free voice calling, SMSes and 350GB 4G data with a validity of 180 days.\n\n-- Rs 9999 plan: Under this plan you get unlimited free voice calling, SMSes and 750GB 4G data with a pack validity of 360 days.\n\nJio non-Prime prepaid plans: Non-prime members again get ten packs for their prepaid connection. Here are they:\n\n-- Rs 19 plan: This is the cheapest recharge offered by Jio and comes with a one-day validity. You get unlimited free voice calling, SMSes and 100MB 4G data in this.\n\n-- Rs 49 plan: You get unlimited free voice calling, SMSes and 300MB 4G data for three days.\n\n-- Rs 96 plan: This is a seven-day pack with free voice callings, SMSes and 0.6GB 4G data.\n\n-- Rs 149 plan: You get unlimited free voice calling, SMSes and 1GB 4G data with this recharge. It has a validity of 28 days.\n\n-- Rs 303 plan: The non-Prime members subscribing to this offer get free voice calling and SMSes and 2.5GB data. The plan is valid for 28 days.\n\n-- Rs 499 plan: User gets unlimited free voice calling, SMSes and 5GB 4G data with this plan. It is valid for 28 days.\n\n-- Rs 999 plan: Under this plan, the non-prime members can enjoy unlimited free voice calling, SMSes and 12.5GB 4G data for a month.\n\n-- Rs 1999 plan: You get unlimited free voice calling, SMSes and 30 GB 4G data for a month with this recharge.\n\n-- Rs 4999 plan: There's unlimited free voice calling, SMSes and 100GB 4G data for a month under this plan.\n\n-- Rs 9999 plan: Under this plan you get unlimited free voice calling, SMSes and 200GB 4G data for a month.\n\nJio Prepaid top up vouchers: There are three top ups available for Jio prepaid users. Rs 10 which gives a balance of Rs 7.7, Rs 20 that gives a balance amount of Rs 15.39 and Rs 50 will claim you Rs 40.48 balance.\n\nJio prepaid full talktime: There are nine full talktime recharge options given on Jio.com - Rs 100, Rs 150, Rs 200, Rs 300, Rs 500, Rs 750, Rs 1000, Rs 2000 and Rs 5000.\n\nNote for Jio prepaid users: Prepaid tariffs are inclusive of all applicable taxes.\n\nHow Jio fares against Airtel and Vodafone\n\nAirtel and Vodafone launched two aggressive plans to match against Jio Prime. Airtel's Rs 345 plan offers 28GB of high-speed data for 28 days. The FUP is set at 1GB but the users will be able to use only 500MB of data during the day, while the remaining 500MB can be used between 12am to 6am. For no limits on timings, users can go for Rs 549 recharge. Also calls beyond the 1,200 bundled minutes will be charged at 30 paise per minute. This pack is available only for prepaid users.\n\nVodafone offers Rs 346 pack under which user gets 28GB of mobile data and unlimited free calls. FUP is 1GB per day and once the limit is reached, user will be charged. The interesting bit here is that the Jio plans are available to all users. However, the Airtel and Vodafone plans, along with those offered by others, are only available to select users. It's like a lottery. Some users get them, most don't.",

(Source: Reuters)\n\nThe Yogi Adityanath government in Uttar Pradesh is planning to negotiate with banks for a soft loan of Rs 2,000 crore to sugar mills that have failed to clear cane dues over the past three seasons, offering itself as a guarantor for the loan, to fulfill the BJP\u2019s poll promise of ensuring timely payment to cane farmers. In a proposal submitted with the principal secretary for sugar by the UP cane commissioner\u2019s office, it has been stated that only 46 out of the 91 private sugar factories in the state have a cash credit limit (CCL), while the remaining 45 sugar factories have been refused the CCL by banks due to their negative net worth. Consequently, these 45 mills unable to pay off the farmers\u2019 cane dues.\n\nBatting for these sugar mills, the proposal states that the sugar mills are keen to pay off cane dues but are not able to do so because of their poor financial condition and absence of bank facility or cash credit. If the state government agrees to give sovereign guarantee to these mills, they would be able to get loans from the banks easily, which would help get their cane dues cleared on time.

It may be mentioned that cane arrears had been a major poll plank of the BJP during the state assembly elections with Prime Minister Narendra Modi hitting out categorically at the previous SP government for failing to get the distressed farmers their cane dues on time.\n\nHowever, reacting on the probability of the government providing sovereign guarantee to the defaulting mills, a miller having strong presence in the state said on condition of anonymity that this would be a \u201cdisaster\u201d as it encourages defaulters.",

The MBBS degree will be awarded by IIT-Kharagpur, which is yet to formulate the admission process. \"We will be at liberty to conduct our own entrance examination and not necessarily admit students from NEET.

We want this to be a research hospital and patients should benefit from the technological developments at IIT.\"The super-specialty hospital will include departments, such as cardiology, neurology, orthopaedic, out-patient, besides a medical diagnostic centre and an emergency ward. \"The hospital will run as a special purpose vehicle under a registered society with a Board of Governors at the helm.

        "body2": "diagnosed with autism +\n\nBENGALURU: Om was born in October 2009 without any complications. However, two years later, the boy's parents and playschool teachers noticed that he preferred to play alone, was not focusing and didn't like to be part of the rhymes circle.The child's speech wasn't developing and he wouldn't cry. Doctors, however, said the child was fine and would catch up soon. In fact, his pediatrician was a senior doctor from a superspecialty hospital in the city. Eight months later, as suggested by a special educator, the boy's parents took him to a psychiatrist. That is when little Om was diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), a complex developmental disability. The signs typically appear during early childhood and affect a person's ability to communicate and interact with others.Om, now seven, is among many children who areafter much delay. This is primarily due to lack of orientation and training among MBBS students about the developmental disorder. While autism finds only a passing mention in MBBS course, it's only an introduction in MD pediatrics.\"If all the pediatricians we visited were more aware and alert, we could have diagnosed his problem 8 months earlier and could have immediately put him on therapy . Earlier the therapy begins, greater the chances of improvement,\" said Geetha V M, Om's mother.\"Brain development is maximum in the first three years of life, and that's when the therapies have an impact on a child with autism. Early intervention through communication and speech therapy could even help a child overcome autism,\" says pediatrician and autism specialist Dr Shilpa Rao. Dr Rao is herself a mother of a 17-year-old boy who has almost recovered from autism. If a child doesn't pick up speech, fails to socialize, and doesn't imitate or is lacking in efforts to communicate, then parents must inform the pediatrician about the child's behaviour.Dr Karunakara B P, former president of Indian Academy of Pediatrics, Karnataka chapter, says the need of the hour is to train pediatricians and general practitioners on telltale signs of autism. \"Unless we diagnose early, a child with autism doesn't get better,\" he says.According to Dr Nandini Mundkur , autism specialist and director of Centre for Child Development and Disabilities, cases of autism are only increasing. \"I get to see 3-4 new cases a day. Though no survey has been done, we can say that one in every 125 children suffers from autism. Not tracking mental milestones is a major lacuna. Pediatricians should not just ask about a child's sitting, standing and walking activities, but also check if the kid smiles, likes to mingle and expresses emotions,\" she says.\"Saying rhymes, numbers and alphabets isn't speech. A child has to express hisher emotions through language. Parents' doubts must be addressed by pediatricians who also need to educate themselves,\" adds Dr Nandidi.",

He is also the co-founder of Ravvish, a project which endeavours to build peace between different religions.\n\nHowever, in the entire process he claims to be overwhelmed with the type of support he has received. His friends and professors from University of Chicago along with Fulbright officials have been very supportive. \u201cPeople I barely knew before also reached out me,\u201d he said.\n\nSyed has been given an official leave of absence till the start of the new semester in September. \u201cI have all the relevant documents just need a visa now [to go back to continue his education at the university]\u201d he said.\n\nThe reasons why he was stopped remain unclear, soon after this incident Trump\u2019s administration had announced ban on seven Muslim countries (in which Pakistan was not included).\n\nIn 2014, he also went on a US government-sponsored undergraduate cultural exchange programme to American University in Washington.\n\nWhen asked how he is dealing with the situation, he told Geo.tv an anecdote. He said that in his university, students had to write reflection journals but he did not follow the practice regularly. Going through the phase, his friends encouraged him to start writing reflection journals again.\n\n\u201cWhen I opened my reflection journal, I found the word \u2018Patience\u2019 written on it,\u201d The word was enough to remind him of the Sufi path he has chosen to take. A Sufi's path is riddled with pain, he said.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to blame anyone or hold anyone responsible for this.\u201d However, through this incident he wants to raise awareness about the importance of speaking about the injustice.\n\n\u201cI want all the people who have dealt with injustice to raise their voice. One decision can have a lasting impact on others\u2019 lives. Authorities with decision making powers should realise that one decision can affect someone\u2019s life, career, family among others.\"\n\nAs for his future plans, he is going to wait till September and apply for visa once again. However, if that does not pan out then he hopes to go to UK for further studies.\n\nSadly, many UK universities do not take transfer credits, he remarked, adding that he will again have to apply to universities from scratch.\n\n\u201cIn the meantime, I have settled in Karachi at my family home and started working for The Citizens Foundation. I hope to start working with students and teachers in interior Sindh near my hometown in Thatta over the summers under Ravvish,\u201d he shared in a Facebook post.\n\n\u201cThere is still hope that things will sort out soon and I will continue my education.

Tomorrow, you have to wake up bright and early for an open-air party Equal Streets , as promised, is back.The movement, supported by TOI, returns this Sunday to make cars vanish for three hours. By closing off a 2.1km stretch from Juhu Circle to Mithibai College to vehicles from 6am to 9am, the movement will help you stretch, run, cycle, play and, above all, reclaim that evasive road space. On offer are a bouquet of activities including on-the-spot portraits, mini tennis, zumba and origami. You can even have your face read by a 90-year-old seasoned cartoonist and face reader.While having fun, Mumbaikars are now becoming aware of one of the biggest goals of the movement that was born in 2014\u2014helping unclog Mumbai's car-blocked arteries. Equal Streets was initiated in 2014 as a way to facilitate the importance of sustainable transport in our community. Already, the citizen-led movement, supported by the Times of India, has started showing results. In a survey conducted by the movement, it emerged that Equal Streets has inspired at least 22% of 600 respondents to purchase a cycle and 72 percent to start walking or cycling for short trips.Public transport too is a positive force that can significantly transform our cities into environmentally sustainable and economically equitable ones, say urban planners. They point out that by 2050, the global urban population will increase by at least 2.5 billion people. While emissions from industry are decreasing, emissions related to transport are expected to rise more than 50% by 2030. \"We hope to raise awareness around public transport use in Mumbai, direct people towards easily accessible information, while also encouraging them to use buses to access Equal Streets,\" says Dhawal Ashar, senior associate, EMBARQ India and founding member, Equal Streets.The Equal Streets loop is well-accessible by three stations on Western Railway line\u2014Bandra, Khar, and Santacruz. Additionally, on Sunday mornings, a total of 21 bus routes also provide access to the area by connecting to major residential areas such as Colaba, Lower Parel, Dadar, Wadala, Dharavi and Andheri. BEST buses from any of these destinations have an average frequency of every 10 minutes, and can be used for a comfortable and convenient journey. \"As Equal Streets grows, more people are realizing this is more than just a fun Sunday event, but rather a sustained movement to make Mumbai healthier, happier and more inclusive,\" says Sachi Aggarwal of EMBARQ India.Want to do your bit for Mumbai's lungs?

A bench of Justices V M Kanade and Swapna Joshi held that an order directing execution of an arbitral award is not appealable.The order that Vijaypat Singhania and Gautam wanted to appeal was an order passed by Justice K R Shriram last year in one such arbitration matter. An arbitrator had in 2008 divided the family properties of the Singhanias three-ways between the Mumbai, Kolkata and Kanpur branches of the family. The Mumbai bungalow was to go to the Kolkata group and some Kanpur properties to the Mumbai group. The Kolkata group had given Rs 46 crore to both.The Kolkata group, comprising the family of Singhania's late brother, had sought execution of the award to get possession of the Mumbai bungalow.Last year, Justice Shriram had directed the Raymond Group chairman emeritus Singhania, to honour the arbitral award and hand over vacant possession of Kamla Cottage, his Juhu bungalow to the Kolkata branch. The bungalow is considered a veritable museum filled with valuable art, artefacts and furniture. The order to vacate the bungalow was the first setback to Singhania. It was on a plea by the family of Singhania's late brother from the Kolkata group for execution of the arbitral award, to get possession of the Mumbai property.The judge had asked the Mumbai group, which includes Singhania, to pursue separate proceedings to get its due from the Kanpur group. The Singhania family ran JK Bankers, a partnership firm. In 1987, a family settlement dissolved it. Disputes arose, and in 2008 an arbitrator had finally split all immovable properties three-way.Singhania resides at Bhulabhai Desai Road.Singhania, son Gautam and Sushila Singhania, filed an appeal. Their case was that the exchange of properties be simultaneously done. Besides, the tenanted Kanpur property was also encumbered by the Kanpur group, argued the Mumbai group. The court, after hearing their counsel, Milind Sathe and Virag Tulzapurkar and Zal Andhyarujina for the Kanpur group as well as the Kolkata group's counsel Dinyar Madon who raised preliminary objections to the maintainability of the appeal, held that execution orders were not appealable as if it was a decree.The HC had last directed the Kolkata group to deposit Rs 46 crore which it did. Justice Shriram had held that Singhania cannot refuse to hand over the Juhu bungalow as he had not received properties due to him from the Kanpur group.The HC had earlier upheld the award in 2009 and then again, in appeal, in 2013.

Also, the patient\u2019s family members have asked us not to reveal more details, but there is definitely an improvement in Vinod Khannaji\u2019s health,\u201d the official said.\n\nVinod Khanna\u2019s deteriorated health could be one reason why he missed the trailer launch of his movie, Ek Thi Rani Aisi Bhi, in which he is portraying the role of the king of Gwalior, opposite Hema Malini who is playing the role of Vijaya Raje Scindia, the queen of Gwalior.\n\nA sitting MP from Gurdaspur, Vinod Khanna has changed fields and is rarely seen in films. With a career spanning almost five decades, the actor has appeared in a number of blockbusters and was considered competition to Amitabh Bachchan in his heydeys. Having done over 141 films, he also appeared in the television show Mere Apne, produced by Smriti Irani.\n\nHere\u2019s wishing Vinod Khanna speedy recovery!\n\nFor all the latest Entertainment News, download Indian Express App now\n\n\u00a9 IE Online Media Services Pvt Ltd",
