        "body0": "Less than a year ago  an international team of astronomers put the star TRAPPIST 1 in the news  TRAPPIST 1 itself is unremarkable  belonging to the class of small  dim stars known as  ultracool dwarfs   Rather  it was the presence of three planets orbiting the star that made the news  While they probably orbit too close to support liquid water  TRAPPIST 1's proximity to Earth it's less than 40 light years away makes detailed observations of any planetary atmospheres a realistic possibility   But the orbit of the outermost planet  TRAPPIST 1d  wasn't well defined by the initial observations  causing its discoverers to go back for some followup observations  Those turned up four more planets  three of which are likely to be in the habitable zone of their host star  As the orbit of the outer one is  once again  uncertain  more observations will undoubtedly be in the works  Who knows what they'll turn up   The TRAPPIST family  TRAPPIST 1 got its name from the telescope that first spotted the planets  the Transiting Planets and Planetesimals Small Telescope  although researcher Emmanu l Jehin noted   By the way  Trappist is the name of a famous Belgian special beer   It's a Belgian project that searches nearby dwarf stars for the presence of planets  since the dim star would make observations of planetary atmospheres much easier  The team's first telescope is based in Chile's Atacama desert  but it has since added a second in Morocco   Both telescopes were used to try to sort out the orbit of TRAPPIST 1d  which was thought to be the outermost planet in the system  Other instruments joined in the observations  including the 3 8 meter UK InfraRed Telescope  UKIRT  in Hawaii  the 4 meter William Herschel and the 2 meter Liverpool telescopes at La Palma  Spain  and the South African Astronomical  Observatory 1 0 meter telescope  Unfortunately  the additional data only confused matters   these light curves showed several transit like signals of unknown origins that we could not relate to a single  orbital  period    So  they brought in the big guns  NASA's Spitzer space telescope  The initial results were so intriguing that Spitzer provided 20 days of near constant imaging of TRAPPIST 1  This imaging identified 34 individual transit events  combined with ground based data  it was possible to clearly identify six orbiting planets   Two of the transits previously thought to be TRAPPIST 1d turned out to be from different planets entirely  another turned out to be three planets transiting simultaneously   A seventh was only observed a single time  so further observations will undoubtedly follow  our catalog of planets surrounding TRAPPIST 1 may not be complete yet   The six inner planets  TRAPPIST 1b g  are tightly packed around their host star  with orbital periods of 1 51  2 42  4 04  6 06  9 1  and 12 35 days  That means they also orbit close enough to exert gravitational influences on each other  which may speed up or slow down individual orbits  These create what are called transit timing variations  where a planet may appear in front of its host star a few minutes earlier or later than would be expected if it is orbiting on its own   These orbital interactions may have been key to stabilizing the TRAPPIST 1 system  The ratios of the time it takes for neighboring planets to orbit are all ratios of integers  8 5  5 3  3 2  3 2  and 4 3  Integer ratios provide interactions that help prevent the sort of planetary chaos that can launch planets out of the exosolar system or send them spinning into the host star  When we see resonances like this  it's taken as a sign that the planets formed farther from their host star and migrated inward due to friction from the disk of material they formed within  Orbital resonances check this inward migration and produce tightly packed systems like TRAPPIST 1   Rocky  maybe Earth like   The orbital interactions tell us a lot more than the planets' history  though  Since the transit timing variations depend on gravitational interactions  and gravitational attraction depends on mass  the data provides some constraint on the mass of the planets  While the current numbers aren't very exact  the precision will go up with further measurements  Most of them have masses similar to Earth's with a high of 1 4 times Earth  and a low of 0 4 times  The amount of starlight blocked during their transit provides a measure of the planets' size  Their radii range from 75 percent of Earth's size up to 113 percent   On their own  these numbers suggest Earth like proportions  Combined  they give us the density  which hints at their composition  The six inner ones appear likely to be rocky with the exception of planet f  which has a lower density that may reflect a lot of volatiles either a larger atmosphere or a more water rich composition   But a key question is what state that water is in  ice  liquid  or vapor  All of the six well characterized inner planets orbit at distances far shorter than Mercury orbits the Sun  If TRAPPIST 1 were the Sun  all of them would be baked  But it's only eight percent of the Sun's mass  and it burns hydrogen very slowly  As a result  there is a sharp drop off in the amount of radiation reaching the planets from TRAPPIST 1  Even the closest gets a bit over four times the amount of light that Earth receives  the most distant receives only 0 13 times  Or  as the authors put it   planets c  d  and f have stellar irradiations very close to those of Venus  Earth  and Mars  respectively    As a result  every single one of the six inner planets is within what's called the temperate zone  where the right conditions mean that water could exist on the surface  Climate models  however  suggest that the three inner planets would end up in a runaway greenhouse warming  By contrast  TRAPPIST 1e  f  and g could all have oceans on their surface  Of course  the planets are almost certainly tidally locked  keeping a single face turned toward their host star  This may turn them into what has been termed an  eyeball Earth   see sidebar    The other big factor to consider when it comes to habitability is the geology of these planets  Not only are some of them big enough to potentially have sustained plate tectonics  but their close proximity may allow gravitational stresses to warm their interiors through tidal forces  much as happens with Jupiter's large moons  So  there's a chance that these planets are being heated both from within and without  Active geology can also have a large influence on the composition of a planet's atmosphere   We may not have long to wait to start finding out  Remember  TRAPPIST 1 was chosen for observations because it's a dim star that makes observations of planets easier   Maybe the most exciting thing here is that these seven planets are very well suited for detailed atmospheric study   said team member Micha l Gillon  Amaury Triaud  another researcher involved in the work  said initial observations are already under way   We're trying to rule out that the planets have a large hydrogen envelope   Triaud said during a press call   This is to make sure that the planets are indeed earthlike    Once launched  the Webb Space Telescope will make these observations even easier  which left Triaud optimistic about future work   If there is life there   he said   maybe  we'll know  within a decade    Nature  2017  DOI  10 1038 nature21360  About DOIs  ",

million  Rs100 2 crore   respectively  My Name Is Khan  2010  and Chennai Express  2013  rank among the top 10 Bollywood grossers in the overseas markets  Even Khan s tepidly received outing Fan  2016  managed to make more than Rs67 crore abroad  His 1998 Mani Ratnam romantic drama Dil Se was the first Indian film to enter the top 10 in the UK box office charts even though it remained a commercial failure in India    There are films that may not have done too well in India but have done reasonably well abroad  There is a fan following that is ready to see anything that has Shah Rukh Khan in it   said trade analyst Komal Nahta   While actors like Aamir Khan and Salman Khan may have slowly crept into the territories formerly dominated by Shah Rukh abroad  the Raees star is supposed to have started the trend as early as the mid 90s and even today  with the exception of a dedicated fan following for someone like Rajinikanth  remains fairly ahead of the pack among Bollywood actors when it comes to wooing NRIs    At an international level  Shah Rukh Khan epitomized the song and dance  Bollywood  romantic hero at the end of the late 1990s   said film critic Raja Sen   For the Indian diaspora  he typifies what they want from a Hindi movie larger than life romance  arms spread out  twinkling eyes and great music which other actors might not always give  I m sure they all have big overseas niches now  but with someone like Shah Rukh  I think audiences are just buying into the idea of what they want Bollywood to be    It was a few years into Khan s career when directors like Subhash Ghai and Karan Johar realized  with their films Pardes  1997  and Kuch Kuch Hota Hai  1998   respectively  that the market was actually abroad  Sen added  The two films made about  1 7 million and  6 3 million  respectively  overseas and solidified Khan s image as someone who played characters that remained Indian at heart despite living outside the country    It was almost a throwback  old school Bollywood in a new  glossier package  And I think that s what people really took to   Sen said   The fact that he s a huge romantic hero and has a massive fan following among women helps take the myth and iconography of it forward    The rise may have been phenomenal but keeping at it hasn t been easy  Unlike most Indian actors  Khan s overseas markets have moved from being conventionally North America  UK and UAE driven to cover regions like Latin America  Peru  Malaysia  Singapore  Netherlands  Belgium  Germany  France  Norway  Denmark and even Middle East countries like Jordan  Palestine  Egypt and Iraq  Constantly capturing audiences there remains a challenge    It is critical to work again and again to engage that audience and our effort is always to go beyond the diaspora   said Gaurav Verma  chief revenue officer at Red Chillies Entertainment  Khan s production house that spearheaded the overseas distribution and marketing campaigns for many of the actor s recent releases that he co produced   The idea  Verma emphasized  is to localize the content in exactly the same way as Hollywood studios try to woo India  Firstly  it is a matter of pushing the availability of the film and distributing it wide enough to get numbers that only come when people other than South Asians turn up   Compared to the 15 20 screens Hindi films typically get in a country like Malaysia  Dilwale was taken to 90 and Raees to 45 50  The latter is the first Indian film in recent times to go to Ukraine and Uzbekistan and is also due for release in Iraq and Egypt which most Bollywood studios don t look at  In more mainstream territories like the US and the UK  trade experts say a Shah Rukh starrer can command nearly 30  more screens than a regular Hindi film   Secondly  it means customizing the marketing and content for local audiences  making it available on platforms that they are on  not just in theatres but across television  Internet and transitional avenues  Verma added it s an important strategy to get Khan s films  either dubbed or subtitled  on local channels in overseas territories    We try and offer the content in the local language and reach out to as many consumers as possible outside the diaspora   Verma said   There are challenges but with him being there  it becomes much easier for us  You need a star with that kind of traction in that market and he s probably the only one    Meanwhile  as younger actors like Ranbir Kapoor  Ranveer Singh and Varun Dhawan struggle to find a foothold abroad  the following that stars like Shah Rukh command becomes stronger by the day    Overseas  he s become bigger than the industry around him   Sen said   You don t have to watch tennis to know how big Roger Federer is  Similarly  people might not know Bollywood per se but if they are into movies internationally  they will have heard of Shah Rukh Khan even if they haven t seen his movies    All figures in this story have been sourced from
