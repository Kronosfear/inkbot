        "body1": "Apple has announced the successor to the iPad Air 2. It isn't called the Air 3, but instead just '9.7-inch iPad'. Here's what you need to know about its price, specs and release date in the UK. See also: Best tablet 2017.\n\nThe new iPad 9.7 was announced in a press release alongside a slightly updated iPad mini 4.\n\nClick here to read the latest version of this article.\n\nWhen is the new iPad 9.7 release date?\n\niPad Air 3 release date: 27-31 March\n\nYou can pre-order a 9.7-inch iPad from 24 March. They will go on sale in Apple stores 'next week'. That could mean as soon as 27 March, or as late as 31 March. In any case, there's not long to wait if you're itching to buy one.\n\nHow much will the new iPad cost in the UK?\n\nWe expected the new iPad to cost \u00a3399 for the Wi-Fi-only 32GB base model - Apple's standard price for the full-size iPad. But the tablet actually costs \u00a3339, which is the lowest price for a new 10in iPad.\n\nIf you want more storage, there's a 128GB version which costs \u00a3429.\n\nThe Wi-Fi + Cellular model costs \u00a3469 for the 32GB model. Pricing for the 128GB 4G version is not yet known.\n\nAll models are available in Silver, Gold and Space Grey. There's no Rose Gold option.\n\nSee also: iPad mini 5 release date, price and spec rumours\n\nWhat's new about the iPad 9.7-inch?\n\nWe didn't expect Apple to change the design of the iPad when it launched the iPad Air 2, but the company surprised us by making the already thin and light device even slimmer. It's 6.1mm thick compared with the 7.5mm of the original iPad Air.\n\nThe new iPad 9.7-inch has returned to that 7.5mm thickness, possibly using exactly the same chassis as the original Air (it looks the same in Apple's photos). The main upgrade is the A9 processor with embedded M9 co-processor. This is the chip originally seen first in the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus. We are assuming that Apple has increased its speed for use in the new iPad, but it never releases these figures officially.\n\nThe only other change is that the screen is now brighter. Apple hasn't said how much brighter, and doesn't quote a figure in the Tech Specs section on its website. Resolution remains the same at 2048x1536 pixels, meaning a 264ppi pixel density. The True Tone screen didn't make it to this low-cost iPad and is one reason to pay more for the Pro model.\n\nNaturally, the tablet will come with iOS 10.\n\nPodcast discussion",

        "body2": "Get daily updates directly to your inbox + Subscribe Thank you for subscribing! Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email\n\nThe iPad mini has been a firm favourite among tablet users for a few years now.\n\nThe bag-friendly little tablet was last given an upgrade in September 2015. And experts are speculating on whether or not it will be brought into the 'iPad Pro' fold in 2017.\n\nAs such, we could see the unveiling of an \"iPad Pro mini\" this year rather than the iPad mini 5. That could mean it comes with its own, smaller, version of the Apple Pencil stylus.\n\nHere's everything we know (or think we know) about the next mini iPad. Keep checking back as we'll update this page when we know more.\n\nLatest news\n\nSupply chain sources seem to be suggesting we could see the next iPad mini unveiled in a matter of days.\n\nApple doesn't publicise its events until the last second, but sources on its supply chain have been talking to Apple-focused site MacRumours .\n\n\"Apple is expected to announce new products later this month, most likely between Monday, March 20 and Friday, March 24, according to reputable supply chain analysts we spoke to who wish to remain anonymous,\" the site reported.\n\nUnfortunately, the sources stopped short of revealing exactly which products are to be revealed.\n\nApple's online store is currently down for scheduled \"maintenance\", suggesting the new iPad Mini is about to be unleashed.\n\nRelease date\n\n(Photo: Getty)\n\nApple almost certainly has a new version of the iPad mini ready to roll - even if production hasn't yet ramped up.\n\nAccording to Taiwan-based DigiTimes, which cites those ever-reliable unnamed \"supply chain workers\u201d, Apple started production in December 2016 for an early 2017 launch.\n\nTraditionally, Apple holds its first event of the year in March. Last year, Apple used an event in March to reveal the 9.7-inch iPad Pro.\n\nIt holds true that the company may take the same approach in 2017 and that would square nicely with the latest rumours mentioned above. However, Apple usually launches its products swiftly after revealing them.\n\nConceivably, the next iPad Mini could be available to buy by the middle of April.\n\nPrice\n\n(Photo: Getty)\n\nApple is expected to introduce a new iPad Mini at the current pricing and shift the iPad Mini 4 down the chain.\n\nThat would mean it would launch at \u00a3379 for the 32GB model and \u00a3469 for the 128GB version. Of course, when Apple does put up its prices, it does so nice and quiet-like. So we can\u2019t guarantee the same pricing, but it\u2019s a good base estimate.\n\nYou can also expect to add an extra \u00a3100 on top if you want to have 3G compatability.\n\nDesign\n\n(Photo: Getty)\n\nAccording to Neurogadget , the new iPad mini will only be 5mm thick, meaning Apple will have shaved 1.1mm off the iPad mini 4.\n\n\"This news has pleased some fans, but others are worried that a thinner body is not really the best idea, because the battery must be reduced in order to fit inside the carcass,\" writes the site.\n\nMeanwhile, other reports have suggested that Apple will trim the bezel around the edges of the tablet and introduce and OLED display for the first time. Broadly speaking, that means better colours because each pixel provides its own illumination rather than needing a backlight.\n\nWhat will be really interesting to see is whether Apple decides to echo the iPhone 7 and drop the headphone jack for the next iPad. There\u2019s been no reports of it so far but we\u2019ll update this piece if and when that changes.\n\nSpecs\n\nApple\u2019s newest iPads will undoubtedly be the most powerful yet.\n\nSeveral Apple specialist sites are suggesting the iPad mini 5 will come with an upgraded A9 processor. That means it'll run faster and there will be better graphics for gaming.\n\nHowever, the camera is heavily rumoured to stay the same. That means, there's likely to be an 8MP camera on the back and a 1.2MP camera on the front. But then again, if you're using a tablet to take pictures you've got bigger problems.\n\nAccording to Cult of Mac, there's a chance of a smaller battery being fitted to the iPad mini 5. This isn't necessarily a bad thing as battery tech has improved to a point where a smaller battery is still as efficient as last year's larger ones.",

The incident took place on a busy road in an area under Saraidhela police station\u2019s jurisdiction. According to police, Neeraj Singh, in his mid-forties and the deputy mayor between 2005 and 2015, was returning home in an SUV \u2014 a Mahindra Scorpio \u2013 with two private guards (Ashok Yadav and Goltu) and his driver Munna when it was intercepted near Steel Gate intersection, around 7.15 pm. The assailants opened fire from the front, and fled thereafter. His aides died on the spot. Singh died soon after he was taken to the nearby Central Hospital.\n\nA police official on condition of anonymity said that a feud in the extended family of late Surya Deo Singh could have led to the killings. Family members and supporters of Neeraj Singh, who was a Congress leader and unsuccessfully contested the 2014 Jharkhand Assembly elections from Jharia seat in Dhanbad district, blamed the police and administration for lapses. Outside the hospital, a large, agitating crowd began protesting, and the police had a tough time controlling them.\n\nThere were reports suggesting AK-47 was used in the firing, but ADG (Operations) and Jharkhand police spokesperson R K Mullik said the police will have to wait for forensic examinations to confirm or deny it. \u201cAt least a dozen rounds were fired. The police are busy with security and law and order. Things will be clear as the investigation progresses,\u201d he said. Late in the evening, Jharkhand Chief Minister Raghubar Das directed the state Director General of Police to ensure that the investigation is carried out quickly.\n\nStating that police are probing the \u201cexact manner in which assailants intercepted the vehicle\u201d, an officer said, \u201cThe vehicle is said to have slowed down near a speed breaker when the firing began.\u201d He added that the assailants must have had clear information about the route Singh was taking, as they took the chance of intercepting them on a very busy stretch.

        "body2": "The Indian Air Force has come under heavy criticism for denying study leave to a airman on the grounds that only officers are entitled to the privilege.\n\nThe airman had sought the leave to pursue an M Tech from IIT Dhanbad after topping the entrance exams.\n\nThe incident comes at a time when the armed forces are facing issues of strained relations between officer and soldier. There is a growing demand for ridding the force of the archaic British-era rules and working to ensure equal benefits for officers and jawans.\n\nThe Indian Air Force has come under heavy criticism for denying study leave to a corporal-rank airman on the grounds that only officers were entitled to the privilege (file pic)\n\nTaking a strong view against the 'discriminatory policy', the Delhi high Court in its February 20 order reprimanded the air force and asked it to frame fair rules for both officers and men.\n\n'Don't deny them equality by refusing them leave to pursue higher studies only on the grounds of rank and status,' the bench headed by Justice Indira Bannerjee said in the order.\n\nAnkur Chhibber, the counsel for corporal BK Verma, told Mail Today that Verma had sought permission for pursuing his M Tech from IIT Dhanbad, after appearing for the graduate aptitude test in engineering exam with permission from Air Force authorities.\n\n'However, that was rejected by Air Force on grounds that there was no provision for sending air force jawans on study leave and this was allowed only for officers,' Chhibber said.\n\nThe IAF grants leave of maximum 28 months to its officers who have completed 15 years of service for pursuing courses in institutions which are approved and certified by it and the knowledge gained from them can be utilised by the service.\n\nAggrieved by the decision of the senior authorities despite recommendation by several of his officers to allow him to proceed for the course, Verma approached the Delhi High Court.\n\nVerma's counsel said the airman was a meritorious student and had completed his B Tech degree while carrying out his duties as a soldier in the force and had even secured a gold medal in his B Tech course.\n\nIndia's Institute of Technology campuses are for the brightest and best students in the country\n\nThe Delhi High Court bench took a favourable view of the petition observing that the Air Force should appreciate the intellect and erudition of the soldier and give him the opportunity to enhance his knowledge and skills.\n\nThe court stated that It is very difficult to appreciate the rationale behind different rule for officer and airmen in the matter of granting study leave.\n\n'It is, in our view, preposterous to assume that only officers would have aspirations of improving their knowledge and educational qualifications, and not the airmen,' the two-member bench said.\n\nThe court observed that the discrimination between officers and airmen for grant of study leave was 'totally discriminatory and violation of the article 14 of the Indian constitution'.\n\nSetting aside the Air Force order to deny study leave to the soldier, the High Court ordered it to frame 'non-discriminatory leave rules and reconsider the application of the soldier for study leave in light of the observations made (by the court).'\n\nVerma, according to his lawyer, is going through his first semester in Dhanbad as he was granted interim relief by the court.\n\nThe Air Force is now considering whether it should go against the court order in the Supreme Court or not.\n\nGenerally, the Air Force is considered to be more lenient than the Navy and Army while dealing with its men.",

She asked if member states would continue to allow it to be part of the bottom-up approach, with involvement of NGOs and civil society. A member of parliament responded that people throughout society should be involved in the governing process. Another regular European urged parliament to work with youth organizations and to not discriminate based on age. She was assured by an MEP that youth employment was a parliamentary priority.\n\nMcGuinness, after the youth unemployment discussion, asked how many thought Europe was doing enough to combat youth unemployment. The room remained still. How many thought Europe could and must do more? Almost all raised their placards.\n\nAnd so perhaps the symbolic event was just that \u2014 a symbolic event, but one that demonstrated that Europeans, dissatisfied though they may be, are still turning to Europe to make life better for Europeans. And with Brexit officially beginning next week and France\u2019s high stakes in the first round of elections just a month away, an event showing that the European Parliament is listening to European people 60 years after the Treaty of Rome was likely a welcome symbol.\n\nIt may also have been a sign of the times. A recent poll by CSA-La Croix shows 66 percent of French people are attached to the European Union, perhaps suggesting that, provided Europe continues to listen to its people for more than two hours, it can make it past the challenges presented to it around its 60th anniversary.\n\nPhoto credit: FREDERICK FLORIN/AFP/Getty Images", 
        "body0": "Prime Minister Narendra Modi is upset with BJP lawmakers skipping Parliament sittings, sometimes causing embarrassment to the treasury benches.\n\nThe BJP with 282 parliamentarians has absolute majority in the Lok Sabha, but there have been instances of sessions being deferred for want of quorum. At least 10% of the House strength should be present to conduct proceedings.\n\n\u201cAttending Parliament is your basic responsibility \u2026 I cannot be present on your behalf,\u201d Modi said at the weekly meeting of the BJP parliamentary party on Tuesday.\n\nHis remarks followed parliamentary affairs minister Ananth Kumar\u2019s reference to incidents and problems arising out of lack of quorum.\n\n\u201cI can call any of you any time,\u201d Modi said, reprising that MPs should not be requested to perform their basic responsibility of attending Parliament sessions.\n\nRead more\n\n\u201cIt is important that you are present in the House.\u201d\n\nParliamentarians are required to mark their attendance in Parliament, a task the Prime Minister is exempted from. MPs get allowances to attend Parliament during sessions, but attendance is largely thin during post-lunch sittings.\n\nKumar and his predecessor M Venkaiah Naidu have repeatedly asked BJP MPs to attend proceedings, but it hasn\u2019t cut much ice.\n\nModi\u2019s tough talk on Tuesday was his first detailed intervention as he advised party MPs not to have other engagements during the Parliament sessions.\n\nHe recalled remarks of an RSS functionary that the Hindutva organisation had spread far and wide, and its members had a lot of work to do, but did not have time to attend the shakha.\n\nLikewise, MPs too seemed to have so much of work that they do not have time to attend Parliament, which should not be the case, Modi said.\n\nHe informed the MPs about a proposed nationwide campaign to make party leaders, including state legislators and office-bearers, well-informed about the goods and services tax (GST) that is expected to be introduced this June.\n\nThese leaders will broadcast the information to the people.\n\nThe GST is showcased as a path-breaking initiative of the Modi government for a \u201cone nation, one tax\u201d regime, which is expected to promote business by doing away with multiplicity of taxation.",

And they print 3 copies of every law.\n\n(Photo: 2015 Bloomberg Finance)\n\nBut despite the cost and the fact that we live in the 21st century, then-Cabinet Office Minister Matt Hancock stepped in, pledging government funds to keep alive the tradition of printing such documents of historical importance as the Brechfa Forest Wind Farm Connection (Correction) Order 2017 on the flesh of a farmyard animal.\n\nUnfortunately for Parliamentary purists, there\u2019s apparently a constitutional problem with the Government paying for bills to be printed.\n\n(Photo: YouTube/BBC)\n\nSo in late January, a backroom compromise was reached. Record copies of laws will be printed on archival paper, and the House of Commons will pay for a vellum cover for every bill, complete with calligraphic titling.\n\nMany argue that it is only because of vellum that we can still read historic documents like the Magna Carta.\n\nAlthough in the time of Magna Carta the chief reason for printing on vellum was not longevity, but because Britain's first paper mill would not be built for roughly 300 years.\n\nIn March last year, the Houses of Parliament stopped using Betamax to archive video recordings of the House of Commons.",

He suggested the government should have brought a separate Bill for the purpose.\n\nLater, Communist Party of India (M) General Secretary Sitaram Yechury said several Bills had been smuggled into the Finance Bill; the move was a subversion of the Constitution, to bypass the Rajya Sabha as the was a money bill.\n\nThe Opposition\u2019s objections were overruled by Speaker Sumitra Mahajan, who ruled that the \u201cincidental provisions\u201d involved in the amendments constituted a money Bill and therefore could be considered as part of the Bill.\n\nDefending the amendments, Jaitley said if a substantial portion of a Bill dealt with imposition or abolition of taxes, then, even if it had incidental provisions, it could still be introduced as a money Bill. \u201cNo tax can be imposed without reference to courts or tribunals.

The Cyber Appellate Tribunal and the Airports Economic Regulatory Authority Appellate Tribunal will be merged with the Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal.

It also introduced one permanent tribunal for interstate water disputes by merging existing ad-hoc bodies.\n\nThe government\u2019s move follows a February 2015 report of a parliamentary standing committee that noted the absence of uniformity in the conditions of service of tribunals.

If someone had asked me this question 20 days back I would have been able to tell something completely different,\" Kher tells PTI.\n\n\"Now, nepotism is what Kangana has said or what Karan is saying. So, anything that I'll say will be either taking her side or his side. But, I think a lot of self-made people are there,\" he adds.\n\nKher, who had no godfather or family background in Bollywood when he did his first movie \u2018Saaransh\u2019 in 1984, says he has gone through a lot of ups and downs in life to achieve what he has today.\n\n\"Life does not offer you a smooth path, you have to go through all bends of ups and downs. It took me three years before I got my first film 'Saaransh' and 10 days before the film, I was thrown out of it.\n\n\"And I fought back to get that. So, just like in real life, there are some people in this industry as well who like you and then there are some who don't like you. But I think as long as you're a self-made person, it's a great quality,\" he says.", 
        "body0": "Anupam Kher talks about being a spy. Anupam Kher talks about being a spy.\n\nBaby was an instant success. Naam Shabana is showing promise. And Anupam Kher, who played the doom-and-gloom Shuklaji in both the films, has a suggestion to make \u2014 why not make Naam Shukla next. The man is a wizard with a computer in both the films but that is not why Anupam wants a full-fledged film on Shukla. His reasons are very different and very hilarious. \u201cNaam Shabana is one of a kind film, which has never been attempted before. A character from a film (Baby) being transformed into a full-fledged commercial film, this gives me an optimistic hope that one day they will also make Naam Shukla. I would like to know from Neeraj (Pandey) why Shukla wears a wig,\u201d Anupam Kher says with a smile.\n\nThe 61-year-old says that Naam Shabana is an exciting concept and hopes it inspires other filmmakers to experiment with their films, \u201cNeeraj is a fine writer. The script is very important. I\u2019m sure it will do really well. We do compare films with Hollywood and they are our benchmark but I think we have our own take on films. We hope this film encourages people to explore more of such concepts.\u201d\n\nSpeaking about the kind of spy he would like to play, the actor rues how the Hindi film industry does not have a legendary detective figure like Sherlock Holmes or James Bond. He said, \u201cI would make a funny spy film like Pink Panther. Such characters are strongly etched in my mind. As a schoolboy, I used to read a lot of Hindi detective novels like Ved Prakash Sharma, Colonel Ranjit and many others. In terms of English, I would read all the commercial writers. But whatever I have seen of Pink Panther, that would be interesting to portray.\u201d\n\nIn terms of spy movies, Anupam feels Bollywood has a lot of catching up to do. \u201cMy character in Naam Shabana is a technical agent who gets things done through the computer and can easily get information by cracking some codes. However, we have to agree that our assumption of a detective is somebody who follows someone or tries to solve a mystery, you know we have strong James Bond kind of association. Real detectives are not so fascinating, they are very normal people. In all the films we are talking about, detectives are so noticeable, usually, it\u2019s the opposite way. In Sherlock Holmes, you spot the detectives from a mile away. These are celebrated detectives. But those who work with agencies like RAW, FBI and all, they can mix with the crowd whenever they want. We (Indian film industry) don\u2019t have a legendary detective figure except for Byomkeysh Bakshi. In India, this sphere is not yet explored properly. There are no original heroes. We don\u2019t have a James Bond kind character yet. Maybe in the future, we will.\u201d\n\nNaam Shabana is also special because, despite such supportive strong characters, it is Taapsee who leads the film. Anupam Kher feels it has a lot to do with the opportunity that has come her way. \u201cIf Neeraj wouldn\u2019t have thought to make the film, this wouldn\u2019t have happened. There are films like Kahaani, Mardaani and all, in the eighties and nineties, Madhur and Sridevi portrayed so many women-driven films\u2026 these films were always being made but the ratio has always been comparatively very low. Strong women have always got strong roles,\u201d he continues adding how CBFC\u2019s ban on women-centric films is purely unfortunate. \u201cThere are many issues which shouldn\u2019t happen. But why to look at negative? Look at where women are today. Women are in front making our country proud. They are doing amazing work. But to say that it (ban on women-centric film) is happening only in India is not true. It has a lot to do with the society. I am being optimistic and trying to change rather than pointing at the problem.\u201d\n\nAlso read | Naam Shabana most obvious step for Baby franchise: Neeraj Pandey\n\nKher also voiced his opinion on Padmavati row, \u201cThe violence is sad. But also, we should not give these people the mileage they are being given because somewhere we have to understand that the attention is making them excited and giving them power that they can do whatever they want.\u201d\n\nFor all the latest Entertainment News, download Indian Express App now\n\n\u00a9 The Indian Express Online Media Pvt Ltd",

The top court was not in agreement with Sahara\u2019s counsel senior advocate Kapil Sibal that the amount should be realised in accordance with the roadmap provided by the group, which suggested the deadline of July 2019 will be adhered to.\n\n\u201cNo small token amounts,\u201d the bench observed, adding that the balance amount of over Rs 14,000 crore can be realised by public auction of Sahara\u2019s unencumbered properties which are free from litigations, mortgage and any charge.\n\n\u201cThe fundamental question is that the court (Supreme Court) found that the money collected by you from XYZ etc was in violation of the rule,\u201d the bench observed while not accepting Sibal\u2019s plea that he should be given at least a minimum of two hours to explain that the apex court judgement against Sahara was \u201cex-facie erroneous\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a question of a core verdict,\u201d the bench said, while referring to the August 2012 judgement by which the Sahara Group was asked to make refund to the investors.\n\nSibal said the court should refrain from passing any order as the review petition against the August 2012 judgement was pending and he would demonstrate the \u201cerror on the face of the records\u201d.\n\nThe bench, which was not impressed with his contentions, said, \u201cYou talk about the attachment of the property. We have no option. You give the list of unencumbered properties which are good enough to bring Rs 14,000 crore. Then we will let you (take back) the Aamby Valley (property) and we will hear you.\u201d\n\nThe bench also said the question of consideration of the interest amount would be taken up after the principal amount has been realised.\n\nWhen the Sahara Group pleaded that it should be given an opportunity to explain its case to satisfy the court that its orders were erroneous, the bench said, \u201cThere is no question of going back.\u201d\n\nSibal submitted that there was a need for \u201cbreathing time\u201d for making the payment and contended that no bank or investor was claiming the money from Sahara Group.\n\nThe senior advocate also raised the issue of demonetisation and liquidity crunch in generating the money. It was following this submission, that the bench asked him to make effort for public auction of the unencumbered properties and expressed its intention of seeking placing a list of properties which are free from litigation and mortgage.\n\nWhile the bench was deliberating on the issue of the list of properties and wanted to know about the Aamby Valley, senior advocate Shekhar Naphade, who is assisting the court as amicus curiae, and SEBI counsel, said the hill resort was approximately worth Rs 39,000 crore.\n\nThe bench noted that the SEBI counsel and Naphade were of the view that the Aamby Valley property was substantial for realising the amount and they favoured its attachement as such a move would press Roy and other directors to endeavour for depositing the amount in the SEBI-Sahara account. This was opposed by Sibal.\n\nHowever, the bench said, it was convinced that the property should be ordered to be attached.\n\nDuring the hearing, Sibal said if the bench was dealing with the issue of Aamby Valley what was the need for seeking a list of properties. When he raised the issue of demonetisation and sought more time to arrange the money, the bench said, \u201cEither you speed up or we will go for your property.\u201d \u201cWe are talking about attachment when we have no option. So, give us the list of properties which are good enough to bring Rs 14,000 crore,\u201d it said.\n\nThe bench had at the last hearing granted liberty to the Sahara Group chief to transfer 35 million pounds, equivalent to Rs 285 crore, deposited in a bank in London to SEBI-Sahara account as part of Rs 600 crore payment required to be made. That order was complied with today.\n\nThe apex court had on November 28 last year asked Roy to deposit Rs 600 crore more by February 6 in the SEBI-Sahara refund account to remain out of jail and warned that failure to do so would result in his return to prison.\n\nThe apex court had on May 6, 2016 granted a four-week parole to Roy to attend the funeral of his mother. His parole has been extended by the court ever since.\n\nRoy was sent to Tihar Jail on March 4, 2014. During the last hearing, the bench had scrutinised the repeated extension of Roy\u2019s parole and said too much indulgence had been shown to him by the court.\n\nBesides Roy, two other directors \u2013 Ravi Shankar Dubey and Ashok Roy Choudhary \u2013 were arrested for the failure of Sahara group\u2019s two companies \u2013 Sahara India Real Estate Corporation (SIRECL) and Sahara Housing Investment Corp Ltd (SHICL) \u2013 to comply with the court\u2019s August 31, 2012 order to return Rs 24,000 crore to their investors.
