        "body0": "The U.S. women's national team entered Tuesday's SheBelieves Cup finale with a chance to win the competition for a second straight year. Instead, it's finished dead last.\n\nGoals from France's Camille Abily and Eugenie Le Sommer within the first 10 minutes set the stage for a 3\u20130 victory under the rain at RFK Stadium in Washington, D.C., giving France the championship of the high-profile friendly tournament. With Germany beating England 1\u20130 in their finale, the combination of points and goal differential sent the U.S. to fourth place, when a win would've launched the Americans to the top of the table. Such are the fine margins of a competition featuring four of the top five teams in the world.\n\nDespite the unofficial nature of the tournament, the consecutive losses on home soil for the first time in over 17 years (February, 2000) will be a cause for concern for the U.S., especially coming off a worst-ever showing at the Olympics. As the USA goes through its transition in the 2019 World Cup cycle, and with few truly meaningful games to play until qualifying commences, it's clear there's plenty of work necessary for the team to get back to its 2015 World Cup-winning level.\n\nHere are three thoughts on the finale and the implications for the U.S. women:\n\nPsychological edge over France disappears\n\nNo matter how many strides France has made in the women's game, it always seemed to fold on the big stage, especially against the U.S. Whether it was in the Olympics last summer, in the SheBelieves Cup that preceded it or the 2015 Algarve Cup final, despite playing the U.S. tight, France would eventually wilt. This is a big win both on the field and on the psyche for Les Bleues going into the 2019 World Cup that France will host. Under new manager Olivier Echouafni, perhaps France can turn its great generation into a trophy-winning power after all. Talent was never the issue under his predecessor, Philippe Bergeroo.\n\nThe SheBelieves Cup trophy may not be the most prestigious piece of silverware, but given who else was involved in the competition, it's not too shabby of a building block, either. For the French, it's aptly named. They certainly believe they can play on the USA's level\u2013or vastly exceed it\u2013when it matters now.\n\nThe 3-5-2 has a ways to go\n\nA lot of this competition was about experimentation for all four teams involved, and with manager Jill Ellis trying to refine the USA in a 3-5-2 formation, there were bound to be some hiccups. On top of that, Ellis elected to keep the likes of Julie Johnston, Alex Morgan, Crystal Dunn, Lindsey Horan and rising star Mallory Pugh on the bench until the result was largely in hand. Once Pugh and Dunn entered at halftime, the USA's attack was vastly improved, though it didn't result in anything on the scoreboard. So before hitting every panic button in sight, take in the result with the proper perspective.\n\nThat said, if the 3-5-2 is going to be the way of the future, there's a ways to go on the learning curve. France wisely exploited the space with its speed and picked its spots precisely. It beat the U.S. in all facets and absolutely earned its result.\n\nLe Sommer's goal, for example, came seconds after a U.S. possession in France's final third. It took no time at all to identify the weakness and attack it.\n\nEug\u00e9nie Le Sommer = really fast. #USWNT in trouble early in the final match of the #SheBelievesCup https://t.co/hxISesDHH7 \u2014 FOX Soccer (@FOXSoccer) March 8, 2017\n\nThe third was an instance of shambolic spacing and defending, with the U.S. late every step of the way. That kind of play isn't going to cut it at the highest level.\n\nAbily makes it 3!\n\n\n\nFrance in control with a 3-0 lead with 20 minutes remaining. #SheBelievesCup https://t.co/ZeQZICvYIa \u2014 FOX Soccer (@FOXSoccer) March 8, 2017\n\nCommunication appeared to be a disaster across the back. Whereas the Johnston-Becky Sauerbrunn central pairing flanked by Ali Krieger and Meghan Klingenberg was largely unbeatable at the World Cup, the trio Tuesday was a polar opposite. As to be expected from an experimental squad, chemistry and cohesiveness were lacking and it showed in a big way.\n\nThree questions that persist\n\nIs Alyssa Naeher the heir apparent to Hope Solo? In her audition to replace Solo, Naeher didn't cover herself in glory in the opening of the de facto final. Between fouling Le Sommer to concede the opening penalty and deciding to stay rooted to her line as Le Sommer charged ahead on the counter, that's a tough sell. Now, she wasn't done any favors by the three-player back line and she did shut out Olympic champion Germany in the opener. Getting the nod in the final would signal that she's ahead of Ashlyn Harris, who started in the 1-0 loss to England, in Ellis's pecking order.\n\nWhich players helped themselves? Casey Short, Allie Long, Rose Lavelle, Sam Mewis and Lynn Williams were a handful of players who received ample opportunities to prove themselves against top competition. Williams scored the USA's only goal of the competition, a winner vs. Germany, but also plays in the age of Morgan, Dunn and Pugh. Mewis and Lavelle generally fared well in the midfield, Long appeared miscast in the back and Short endured plenty of pains against France. While a Long-Short tandem makes for great puns and potential headlines, it's not necessarily a reflection of who should play in the back. How Ellis views all of their performances, and through what prism, is all that matters at this juncture, but it was far from a sweeping success across the board.\n\nIs a CBA resolution in sight? The hope was that it'd be done and dusted before this competition. It wasn't, and now there isn't exactly a pressing target date to hit. A significantly improved deal would go a ways in restoring some good morale across the U.S. women. It'll be a while before they'll be able to achieve that feeling on the field in an environment with some real stakes together after Tuesday's setback.",

        "body2": "Kevin Bolger (Minocqua, Wis.) of the University of Utah wins gold in the classic sprint at the L.L.Bean U.S. Cross Country Championships at the Soldier Hollow Nordic Center near Midway, Utah.\n\nI\u2019ve had cold hands before. Usually, once the starter shoots the gun, it\u2019s kind of full-on, and I\u2019m not really thinking about much else but racing. I didn\u2019t realize there was a problem until about 3 (kilometers) left.\n\nSALT LAKE CITY \u2014 Kevin Bolger knew his hands were cold.\n\nBut then, the lifelong cross-country skier had plenty of experience with weather-related discomfort.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had cold hands before,\u201d Bolger said. \u201cUsually, once the starter shoots the gun, it\u2019s kind of full-on, and I\u2019m not really thinking about much else but racing. I didn\u2019t realize there was a problem until about 3 (kilometers) left.\u201d\n\nThe Wisconsin native is also not one to let anything, even pain, distract or derail him from a goal.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s an extremely affable, rather calm, very nice individual,\u201d said Utah director of skiing Kevin Sweeney. \u201cThe one thing I think he really has a great talent for is when he turns on his game face, or gets into that pre-race protocol, you know a switch is flipped and he\u2019s an incredibly focused individual. I think that\u2019s why he got into trouble in Alaska because he\u2019d made a commitment to that race, and not only for himself but really more so for the team.\u201d\n\nThe senior captain for Utah\u2019s nordic team was racing in his last competition of the week-long meet in Girdwood, Alaska, in early February, and he hoped to finish the 20-kilometer race the same way he\u2019d finished his other events this season \u2014 on the podium.\n\n\u201cIt was the one race of the season, I finished off the podium,\u201d said the Utah senior. \u201cI was fourth. I was still really happy with the performance, though.\u201d\n\nVery quickly, it became clear that there was a much bigger issue than missing out on a medal for the first time this winter.\n\n\u201cI looked at my hands out of my gloves, and I was like, \u2018My hands are frozen,\u2019\u201d he recalled. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t really think that much about it, like I didn\u2019t think about frostbite or anything. They were just really, really cold.\u201d He crossed the finish line and sought help from Utah\u2019s athletic trainer.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t take my skis off,\u201d he said. \u201cI still didn\u2019t think it was anything like frostbite, so I took my gloves off and my hands were completely white. I was like, \u2018Whoa!\u2019\u201d\n\nBolger was told to warm his hands slowly, so he wrapped them in a jacket. As they thawed, it became clear that he\u2019d suffered frostbite.\n\n\u201cIt was painful at first,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I thought, in like three or four hours, I\u2019m going to be fine. I didn\u2019t think it was going to be close to a three-week process with a giant question mark on my season.\u201d That question mark remains, despite the fact that the senior, who was enjoying the best season of his nordic career is planning to compete with his teammates in the NCAA Championships this week in New Hampshire.\n\nBolger, who was named Rocky Mountain Intercollegiate Ski Association (RIMSA) MVP with two wins and six podiums this season, as well as a U.S. National Championship victory, wears gloves that protect his hands and hide the red, raw and peeling skin. On the eve of his final opportunity at an NCAA national championships, his hands still look swollen and sore.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s still a question,\u201d he admitted of whether it will be warm enough to allow him to compete this week. \u201cI do have to make a decision depending on if it\u2019s warm enough or not. It could impact my life further down the road if I make the wrong decision. My hands are just vulnerable right now.\u201d\n\nThat decision is made more complicated by Bolger\u2019s success this season, which included winning his first U.S. National title in January.\n\n\u201cI won U.S. Nationals sprint race this year,\u201d he said of the races that were held in Midway in January. \u201cThat was a giant motivator. That was one of those things that showed me I can compete with those athletes. When I did win the U.S. Nationals, it wasn\u2019t a goal of mine. I wanted to go there. I wanted to race strong. But I wasn\u2019t prepping to race fast there like a lot of the skiers are.\u201d\n\nIt isn\u2019t just the possibility of an NCAA championship that Bolger has to consider. He\u2019s hoping this winter is more of a launch pad for his dreams rather than a final chapter.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to make a big push, absolutely, to try and make (the 2018 Olympic team),\u201d he said. \u201cIt will take a jump in my training. I\u2019ll have to refocus, set different goals, and obviously, it\u2019s different than collegiate skiing.\u201d\n\nSweeney said the season has been successful, in large part because of the leadership of his seniors and the willingness to work and adapt of his new skiers. Just whether or not the season will exceed his expectations remains to be seen this week.\n\nAs for Bolger, however, Sweeney said he\u2019s accomplished more than expected this winter.\n\n\u201cI would say he\u2019s exceeded it,\u201d Sweeney said. \u201cYou know, that\u2019s the irony of what happened with the frostbite and literally the potential of him not being able to go to the championships because he\u2019s exceeded my expectations in being one of the top-ranked skiers from the west in both disciplines.\u201d\n\nBolger hasn\u2019t just competed in both classic and freestyle, he\u2019s skied his way onto the podium \u2013 regardless of discipline.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that common because you tend to see somebody who is a little more of a specialist in one or the other,\u201d Sweeney said. \u201cFor Kev to come in and be as balanced and able to strike in both disciplines has been quite an accomplishment.\u201d\n\nUtah\u2019s skiers begin their quest for NCAA glory on Wednesday with men\u2019s and women\u2019s giant slalom. Nordic hits the snow Thursday with 5K classic and men\u2019s 10K classic. The races conclude Saturday with men's 20-kilometer and women's 15-kilometer freestyle races.\n\nOf the 12 skiers representing the Utes in New Hampshire, two are defending NCAA title holders \u2014 slalom champ Julie Mohagen and men\u2019s giant slalom champ Endre Bjertness.\n\nUtah hopes to better it\u2019s third place finish from the last two seasons, and in order for that to happen, the team\u2019s leaders, Bolger and Natalia Muller, who earned All-American honors last year in freestyle, will need to lead their younger counterparts to some of their best results of the season.\n\n\u201cI think (this year) has been very positive,\u201d Sweeney said. \u201cAnd I do attribute that to leadership, and you know, to the younger athletes being open minded. I think we\u2019re set up for a good performance.\u201d",

The video titled 'My First Women's Day' shows a woman celebrating her son's decision to go for a sex-change operation and how she welcomes him to an all-new world. It ends with the message that acceptance begins at home.\n\nBrooke Bond Red Label\n\n\"A good man can make every day Women's Day,\" says the tea brand in its new Women's Day ad.

Yes, some of his toys are pink too, but that doesn't make him a girl! The campaign is called #Unstereotype.\n\nReliance Fresh\n\nThe retail chain's campaign, #JeeLeZara featuring actors Renuka Shahane and Sachin Khedekar prompts every woman to ask herself a very important question, \"When will I go to Goa if not at 50?\" The irony delivers the message with ease.\n\nStar Sports\n\nStar Sports' campaign #CheckOutMyGame takes reference from various sports such as cricket, badminton, kabaddi, gymnastics, swimming, boxing and wrestling in which women actively participate. The TVC features Olympic heroes PV Sindhu, Sakshi Malik, Dipa Karmakar, Mary Kom and other celebrated sportswomen who continue to be an inspiration.\n\nDatsun redi-GO\n\nOn International Women's Day, Datsun India has announced a special offer for women thinking of buying a car. It has also rolled out an online campaign, #DrivenByHer to celebrate contemporary women and challenge existing mindsets towards women drivers in society.\n\nParag Milk Foods\n\nAs an expression of gratitude towards women, Gowardhan Ghee - the flagship product of Parag Milk Foods - has launched a campaign, #CookForHer that urges men to thank the ladies in their lives.\n\nJSW Group\n\nIndian conglomerate JSW Group which has footprints across core economic sectors, namely, steel, energy, infrastructure, cement, ventures and sports, celebrates the struggles and victories of women in a campaign featuring Sakshi Malik.

Brands have rolled out an ad campaign to break the gender inequality and the stereotype mentality among people while many others urged the audience to do something special for the women in their lives. All brands aimed to honor women with their campaigns.Here\u2019s a look at the various ad campaigns based on women-centric themes by the brands in 2017.Raising the issue of gender inequality, the channel owned by Star India has released a Women\u2019s Day special of \u2018Nayi Soch\u2019 \u2013 their on-going brand campaign. The campaign is created by Ogilvy and directed by Nitesh Tiwari of Dangal fame. The film features Aamir Khan as Gurdeep Singh, a sweet shop owner in a small town. When a customer praises his business, he attributes the success to his children who have taken the business online. Now the customer assumes that the children are boys, so he is surprised to see two young girls supervising the delivery of online orders. As the customer walks outside the shop, he sees the changed signboard written \u2018Gurdeep Singh & Daughters\u2019.With this campaign, the channel not only questions the gender discrimination that still exists, but also iterates the belief that it is time for fathers to step up and inspire their daughters with confidence and self-belief.For #CheckOutMyGame!, Star Sports took reference from various sports where women actively participate and play such as Cricket, Badminton, Kabaddi, Gymnastics, Swimming, Boxing and Wrestling.

Television footage showed some of them trapped on the ledge of a top-floor window.\"Attackers are inside the hospital.

I had to jump over the barbed wire to escape.\"At least two other loud explosions -- including what the defence ministry called a car bomb in the hospital's parking lot -- were heard as Afghan special forces launched a clearance operation that lasted around six hours.The attackers were gunned down after special forces landed on the roof of the hospital in a military helicopter.\"More than 30 people were killed and around 50 wounded in today's attack,\" defence ministry spokesman Dawlat Waziri told AFP. \"Most of the victims are patients, doctors and nurses.\"Afghanistan's warring parties , including government forces, have repeatedly targeted medical facilities, decimating the country's fragile health system and preventing conflict-displaced civilians from accessing life-saving care.\"This is a criminal act.

The country is bracing for an intense fighting season in the spring as the government's repeated bids to launch peace negotiations with the Taliban have failed.Afghan forces, already beset by record casualties, desertions and non-existent \"ghost soldiers\" on the payroll, have been struggling to beat back insurgents since US-led NATO troops ended their combat mission in December 2014.Kabul last month endorsed US General John Nicholson's call for thousands of additional coalition troops to hold off the militants before the spring offensive.Extra troops were needed to end the stalemate in the war, Nicholson, the top US commander in Afghanistan, told the US Congress in what could be President Donald Trump 's first major test of military strategy.",
