        "body1": "This is the red carpet stretch of Peter V  Ueberroth s life   Ueberroth will receive the Los Angeles Sports Council s Lifetime Achievement award Monday night in a ceremony at the Beverly Hilton  an affair similar to last month s Golden Globes at the same venue minus the booze  cleavage and snark  Fourteen months earlier Ueberroth  San Jose State  59  received the Theodore Roosevelt Award  the NCAA s highest honor   Ueberroth 79  has also been bestowed with something of a lifetime achievement award by Merriam Webster  a recognition that views with both humor and pride    The Contrarian Group when we formed it  contrarian was not in the dictionary   Ueberroth said recently referring to the Newport Beach private equity firm he helped found in 1989    Now it s in the dictionary as a noun  as an adjective  as an adverb  contrarian minded    Sure enough there it is  Contrarian  a person who takes a contrary position or attitude  specifically  an investor who buys shares of stock when most others are selling and sells when others are buying   Ueberroth has described himself as a  mountain climber by nature   the contrarian who took the Olympic movement  Major League Baseball and the U S  Olympic Committee to new heights by charting his own course  defying the skeptics  the experts almost every step of the way   Sports account for a quarter of his nearly 60 year career   Fifteen years of staying out of my natural habitat of being a businessman   he said  But as head of the 1984 Olympic Games  MLB commissioner and USOC chairman showed his contrarian streak  investing  staking his reputation on three entities at a time when no one else was buying   Much of Major League Baseball was financially and morally broke when Ueberroth took over as commissioner in October 1984  Ueberroth negotiated landmark TV deals with CBS and ESPN and steered the game through a series of drug scandals  When he took over only five franchises were profitable  By the time he left before the 1989 season  every franchise was either making a profit or breaking even and baseball as a whole was profitable for the first time since 1973   Twenty years later  Ueberroth was convinced by five U S  senators to become chairman of a USOC in crisis  The combination of escalating administrative costs and a drop in fundraising left the USOC facing a financial disaster that one USOC executive said was like a  a railroad train coming dead at us    Ueberroth streamlined the organization and within four years was able to double the funding to U S  athletes   But mainly Ueberroth will be remembered as the man who saved the Olympic movement by shepherding the record shattering 1984 Games in Los Angeles at a time when many thought the Olympics were on the verge of extinction  Los Angeles won the Games by default when Tehran  the only other bid city  dropped out following the Islamic revolution    We followed all the M s and the M s had difficulties  You just go through those and each had of them had huge problems   Ueberroth referring to the 1972 Games in Munich  terrorism   1976 Olympics in Montreal  financial problems  and the 1980 Games in Moscow  the U S  led boycott    We were a turning point for the Olympic movement and re establishing that it could be viable  That was the 30 000 volunteers we had  our 20 000 employees that did that    The International Olympic Committee finds itself once again in a state of crisis  Budapest last week became the eighth city to withdraw its bid for the past two available Olympic Games  Still Ueberroth remains bullish on the Olympic movement    I think the Olympic movement is very healthy and it s got two great cities bidding and they re both terrific   Ueberroth said referring to 2024 Games bid candidates Los Angeles and Paris   I obviously have my favorite  but I m not involved nor should I be    Ueberroth has known LA 2024 chairman Casey Wasserman since Wasserman was a young boy  Wasserman s grandfather  Lew Wasserman  the Hollywood executive  was part of a group of wise men that also included political power broker Paul Ziffren  lawyer and businessman John Argue and Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley that Ueberroth frequently turned to in the years leading up to the 1984 Games    I would talk to Lew about something and he would say  don t worry about that  That s not going to be a problem a week from now    Ueberroth said   But Ueberroth has resisted playing a similar role to the younger Wasserman    He s not asking me for any advice and we chat but he s got a great group   Ueberroth said    LA 2024 chief executive  Gene Sykes is fantastic  is a very skilled executive  So I think this team is best I ve seen  The U S  has a good chance because of the people they ve put together    Ueberroth once told the Register   I don t have the skill to live in the past     I don t have the clock   Ueberroth said   The look back clock is not very strong in my small brain  I live in the present and the future  and I m excited and activated by what s going on today  tomorrow    The thing about lifetime achievement awards is they force you to at least slow down long enough to glance in your rearview mirror even if at 79 you re still in a hurry to find out what s around the next corner   The other day Ueberroth told how San Jose State water polo coach Ed Rudloff changed the life of an undersized high school player by offering him a scholarship in a sport he was only vaguely aware of    Without that I wouldn t have gone to college   Ueberroth said   In a way Ueberroth returned the favor a quarter century later  helping change the course of the lives of thousands of Olympians and millions more  The 1984 Games produced a  225 million surplus  Forty percent went to the USOC Endowment Fund and continues to subsidize American Olympians  Another  93 million was used to create the LA  84 Foundation  which through Ueberroth s vision and Anita DeFrantz s leadership benefited more than 3 million young athletes and 1 100 sports organizations in the Southern California region  All of which gives a new definition  a special meaning to the term lifetime achievement award    There s thousands of young people that has been provided a new path to their lives   Ueberroth said   A new path to education  a new path to participation as citizens    New paths created by a man who has spent a lifetime charting them   Contact the writer  sreid scng com",
