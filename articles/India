        "body1": "In a comical turn of events, Wriddhiman Saha pounced on Steve Smith, was Ravindra Jadeja's delivery lodged itself between the Aussie skipper's legs. (Photo: BCCI)\n\nRanchi: India and Australia have had an intense two Test so far, in the four-match series. However, things took a lighter turn on the first day of the third Test in Ranchi, when Steve Smith was just three short of a century.\n\nWhile the Aussies were attempting to mount a comeback after losing four early wickets, a rather hilarious incident took place.\n\nRavindra Jadeja\u2019s delivery took a sharp turn and went on to lodge itself between the Australia Skipper\u2019s legs.\n\nIndia wicketkeeper Wriddhiman Saha, thinking that Smith had edged the ball, immediately pounced on the Aussie skipper, to get hold of the ball, as both the cricketers fell to the ground in the melee.\n\nWriddhiman did manage to get what he desired in the end, and even went up in appeal. However, umpire Ian Gould, who could not stop laughing, immediately waved off the appeals, as the ball is considered dead, once it gets stuck in the pads \u2013 or in this case, between Smith\u2019s legs.", 
        "body0": "This home season, we have had the privilege of watching the best batsmen of the current generation. Kane Williamson, Joe Root, Virat Kohli and now, Steve Smith. So, perhaps, one might say that we are in a position to judge. Of the lot, the Australia skipper stands out the most \u2013 well, he literally does.\n\nWhile the others seem pretty conventional \u2013 in terms of technique at least \u2013 Smith could possible conduct an orchestra with his movements.\n\nAt last count, there are at least 19 distinct movements before he finally gets into his stance to face the bowler. He fidgets and he fidgets. Then, as the bowler runs in, he fidgets some more. The bat seems to come from gully (as against the norm of being somewhere between the off-stump and first slip), the stance opens up (exposing the back leg) and he almost seems side-on. But then, magically, amidst all that chaos, it all comes together just in time for the bat to meet ball.\n\nIt isn\u2019t pretty to look at but it is efficient\u2026 brutally so. Smith\u2019s career average after 53 Tests is 60.73 \u2013 in line with the greatest to have ever played the game, only Bradman stands in a different league. In this series, one that has been dominated by bowlers on raging turners, his average stands at 72.25 (289 runs). At Ranchi, he calmly worked his way to another century \u2013 117 off 244 balls and helped Australia reach 299/4 on day one.\n\nThere are many batsmen who are very good at home. It\u2019s understandable as well. The conditions are known and you always have the advantage over the opposition in that sense. But what marks Smith out is how he fares away from home.\n\nAway averages:\n\nSteve Smith: 59.10 (nine of his 19 hundreds)\n\nVirat Kohli: 44.61 (nine of his 16 hundreds)\n\nJoe Root: 44.89 (three of his 11 hundreds)\n\nKane Williamson: 46.41 (nine of his 16 hundreds)\n\nWhile these numbers might drop (or rise) a little on Friday depending on how much he eventually makes, Smith has shown himself to be adept at facing spin and equally comfortable against the fast bowlers in varying conditions. Not bad at all for a player who started his Test career as a bowler and batted at No 8 in his first Test. The difference in averages, honestly, is stark. Can someone be so much better than the rest?\n\nCan someone be so much better than the rest? (AFP)\n\nGoing beyond the numbers\n\nThen, some might argue that sometimes numbers do not tell the whole story. But take into account the kind of build-up he had to the Ranchi Test to see another facet of his genius.\n\nThe DRS controversy had refused to blow over in the break between the Bengaluru and Ranchi Tests, the series was tied at 1-1 and Virat Kohli\u2019s side was increasingly looking like one that had discovered it\u2019s joie de vivre. Smith was enemy No 1 and he seemed rather remarkably nonplussed about it.\n\nOn the eve of the match, Smith had dismissed Kohli\u2019s \u201ccheating\u201d claims as ridiculous. But the hatchet was far from buried. If anything, there seemed to be a silent ratcheting up\u2026 silent because the boards had decided they wanted peace.\n\nThe toss saw both skippers studiously avoid each other, no eye contact and just a cursory handshake. They clearly wanted to settle this on the ground.\n\nIn total control\n\nAfter a quick start, David Warner threw his wicket away. Smith walked in, buckled down and decided to bat. He didn\u2019t look for quick runs, he just looked to stay at the wicket and the rest \u2013 like his batting technique \u2013 just fell into place. Lesser batsmen would have been distracted by the ruckus, but the 27-year-old always seemed in total control.\n\nFor over an hour on day one of the Ranchi Test (between the 69th and 83rd over), Steve Smith was stuck in the 90s. Being that close to the landmark might have made other batsmen nervous, but the Australian skipper was more than happy to watch Glenn Maxwell hog the strike. He seemed comfortable \u2013 as comfortable as all the fidgeting can make him seem.\n\nWhen the last ball of day one was bowled, the duo were still standing, having stitched together a 159-run partnership, with Smith as the junior partner \u2013 67 runs to Maxwell\u2019s 82.\n\n\u201cBrain-fade\u201d artist or not, this bloke can bat. Almost reluctantly, acting skipper Ajinkya Rahane shook his hand, congratulating him. Today, India had been trumped.\n\nIt is a simple game\n\nAs they were walking off the field, Michael Clarke asked Smith what he thought of Maxwell\u2019s innings and his answer, while not getting into specifics, revealed how he sees the game.\n\n\u201cHe had a plan, he stuck to it and put the bad ball away. It\u2019s simple, really.\u201d\n\nWell, it\u2019s rarely ever that simple. But, perhaps, in Smith\u2019s mind it is. Most people have a problem sticking to their goals but the Australian skipper somehow almost never seems to have a \u201cbrain fade\u201d while batting \u2013 at least not when it is related to his batting itself.\n\nBeing able to control what you want to do on the pitch is a huge part of Test cricket and more than anything Smith seems to have mastered that aspect of his game. He will, however, know that his job is far from done.\n\nThe Ranchi wicket is good for batting and will probably stay that way for at least a couple days more. If Australia want to put India in a spot, they will have to bat big and in their captain, they probably have the best man for the job.", 
        "body2": "\n\n\n\nAustralian captain Steve Smith kept the Indian bowlers at bay to carry his side to 194/4 at tea on the first day of the third Test at Ranchi.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEarlier, starting off positively after opting to bat first, Australia cruised to 50 for no loss in 9.3 overs but with the introduction of spin bowlers at both the ends, the visitors lost three wickets for a little over 100 runs on the board.\n\n\n\nRavindra Jadeja struck in his first over with David Warner (19) offering a simple return catch to the left-arm spinner.\n\n\n\nMatt Renshaw (44) was going well and looked set to complete a hat-trick of half-centuries before falling six runs short with Umesh Yadav dismissing the opener in his second spell after a smart change of ends by Virat Kohli.\n\n\n\nIndia's in-form off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin then dismissed Shaun Marsh (2) after India brilliantly used the DRS in their favour.\n\n\n\nAt lunch, skipper Steve Smith was batting on 34 and Peter Handscomb was giving him company at six.\n\n\n\nAussie skipper Smith had criticised the pitch on the eve of the match, terming it mud rolled together, but all the three dismissals did not show any devil in the 22-yard strip.\n\n\n\nBut Australia started well and were happy to score in boundaries on a quick and small outfield. A flick off the pad from Renshaw raced to boundary for Australia's first runs on the board in the first over of Ishant Sharma.\n\n\n\nRenshaw's first 24 runs came only in boundaries as once he cleared a fielder the ball raced past the rope.\n\n\n\nWarner took his time and hit his first boundary after 22 balls with an elegant cover drive off Yadav.\n\n\n\nWith Warner looking to break free, Kohli employed spin attack at both ends and Jadeja was welcomed by the Aussie vice-captain with another crunching drive.\n\n\n\nBut in the next ball, a juicy full-toss, Warner offered Jadeja a return catch, even as his lean patch on the Indian tour continued.\n\n\n\nAfter Warner's departure, India slowly pegged things back.\n\n\n\nSix shy of a half-century, Renshaw edged a simple catch to Kohli at the first slip in Yadav's second over in his second spell.\n\n\n\nAshwin also struck from the other end as India made a fine review to reverse the umpire's call and Marsh was on his way back to the dressing room. Cheteshwar Pujara took a diving catch at forward short leg after the ball took off from the bat and pad.\n\n\n\nEarlier India made one change, bringing back a fit-again Murali Vijay in place of Abhinav Mukund.\n\n\n\nThe Aussie made the two forced changes with Glenn Maxwell and Pat Cummins figuring in the playing XI in place of the injured Mitch Marsh and Mitchell Starc.\n\n\n\nThe four-Test series is locked 1-1 with the last match in Dharmasala from March 25-29.\n\n\n\n\n\nSmith was unbeaten on 80 as Australia scored 85 runs in the second session for the loss of one wicket. Peter Handscomb was the only casualty, falling lbw to pacer Umesh Yadav for 19. Glenn Maxwell was batting on 19 at tea, having put on 54 runs for the fifth wicket along with his captain.Indian captain Virat Kohli went off the field for treatment after hurting his shoulder while diving to stop a run, as India put the brakes on the scoring after a high-scoring first session."

Now, the Council will work out rules on composition, valuation, tax collected at source and transitions. It has already approved rules on refunds, invoices, returns, payments and registration.

I will be quitting the party soon,\" Rane said.\n\nWhen Parrikar was asked to react to Rane going missing during the trust vote, he said: \"Why are you asking me, ask him.\"\n\nThe Congress has alleged that the BJP-led coalition government was legitimate.\n\n\"They have bought over MLAs. They have not allowed us to speak in the assembly or discuss the motion, they have even foisted a Speaker who formerly was reporting to Manohar Parrikar as Chief Minister in 2012.\n\n\"There is no legitimacy for this government,\" Congress spokesperson and MLA Aleixo Reginaldo told IANS.\n\nThe former Defence Minsiter later told reporters that portfolios to the 10-member cabinet would be announced on Saturday.\n\n\"Expansion of the cabinet will be done after the budget session is over. The budget session will begin on March 22,\" Parrikar said.\n\nThursday's trust vote was ordered by the Supreme Court following a petition by the Congress which alleged that Goa Governor Mridula Sinha had played a partisan role in inviting the BJP to form a government although the Congress was the single largest party with 17 MLAs in the 40-member assembly.",

The other 10 seats have been won by the regional political parties with Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party (MGP) winning 3 seats, Goa Front winning 3 seats, Nationalist Congress Party winning one seat and the independent candidates emerging victorious in the remaining three seats.\n\nAfter the formation of Modi government in 2014, the BJP\u2019s high command took a decision of transferring Parrikar to Delhi and gave him the helm of defence. Parrikar, before being the defence minister of India, was the chief minister of Goa.\n\nPolitical pundits believe that BJP\u2019s poor performance in Goa was because of CM Laxmikant Parsekar as he did not handle the CM post properly.

At present he is fully conscious and better. He is kept under observation for further evaluation,\" medical superintendent Dr A K Gadpayle said.\n\nWho will be the new UP CM?\n\nSuspense continued over who will be the new Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, four days after the BJP's resounding triumph in the key Hindi heartland state, where the party won 325 seats with its allies.\n\nWhile the BJP scrambled to form its governments in Goa and Manipur, where it was not even the single largest party, hurriedly cobbling together post-poll alliances, amid the charge of \"stealing\" the mandate, the party leadership is taking its own sweet time to decide the Chief Minister of the country's most populous and politically significant state.\n\nUnion Home Minister Rajnath Singh, the tallest party leader from Uttar Pradesh and a former Chief Minister to boot, is said to be among the frontrunners for the coveted job, but he was dismissive about the possibility.\n\n\"Kya faltu baat kar rahe hain (what nonsensical talk are you doing),\" he retorted when asked by reporters outside Parliament House whether he was a contender. He described the speculation about his return to state politics \"unnecessary and futile\".\n\nSingh has vast administrative experience, including as UP Chief Minister in 2000-02. As speculation swirled about the possibility of a BJP legislature party meeting tomorrow, the party's state unit chief Keshav Prasad Maurya said, \"The picture will be clear in the next two to four days.\" When asked whether all 312 newly elected BJP MLAs will meet here tomorrow as reported in the media, Maurya, a Lok Sabha MP and himself in the running for the top job, said, \"No such meeting has been convened in the first place. So, there is no question of holding or putting it off.\" He said the meeting will take place whenever the party leadership decides.\n\nHowever, at the daily media briefing of the Home Department, IG (Special Task Force) Ram Kumar, while responding to a question said Prime Minister Narendra Modi could visit Lucknow on March 17.\n\n\"Prime Minister Modi may visit Lucknow on March 17. Preparations are going on (in anticipation). IG (Lucknow Zone) is monitoring all the preparations,\" he said. He, however, maintained he had no knowledge of whether it was in connection with the swearing-in of the new government.\n\nThe names of a host of leaders, including some sitting MPs are doing the rounds in political circles.\n\nAmong them is that of Manoj Sinha, an upper caste Bhumihar from the 'Poorvanchal' belt where Prime Minister Narendra Modi's constituency Varanasi is also located.\n\nSinha, MP from Ghazipur, is serving his third term in the Lok Sabha and was given independent charge of Communication Ministry by Modi last year after he impressed him with his performance as Minister of State for Railways.\n\nWhile Singh and Sinha are upper caste Thakur and Bhumihar respectively, Maurya has emerged as the OBC face of the party.\n\nHis elevation as state BJP chief, many feel, helped rally non-Yadav backward castes around the party.\n\nGiven the sheer sweep of BJP's victory which extended beyond geographical and caste boundaries, the party can have the luxury of nominating a person for the top job who can deliver on Modi's development agenda and the promise of putting down alleged lawlessness in the state under Samajwadi Party.\n\nRajnath Singh, a senior leader said, fits the bill because of his stature and administrative experience. He was also capable of bridging caste faultlines.\n\nTop party sources told PTI in the national capital that barring Modi and BJP chief Amit Shah, who have been holding consultations over government formation, hardly anybody had any real clue as to what was happening behind the scene.\n\nBesides the three leaders, some in the party are also\n\nhopeful about the prospects of Suresh Khanna and Satish Mahana, two MLAs who have been elected to the state assembly for eighth and seventh time. Khanna was the BJP legislature party leader in the outgoing assembly.\n\nNames of Shrikant Sharma and Sidharth Nath Singh, two party national scretaries elected as MLAs for the first time, are also being mentioned as probables by a section of leaders, largely because of their proximity to the central leadership.\n\nHowever, their inexperience is seen as a handicap in a large and complex state like Uttar Pradesh. Though firebrand five-term Lok Sabha member Yogi Adityanath (44) is the choice of the more vocal among the party workers, the seasoned ones believe that his brand of politics might not be beneficial for the party in the long run. Also, his hard line 'Hindutva' may not help in carrying along all sections.\n\nThe name of amiable Lucknow mayor and party's national vice-president Dinesh Sharma (53) is also being discussed.\n\nHe is a Brahmin.\n\nWhen contacted, some newly elected MLAs told PTI they have not been officially communicated about any meeting of the legislature party.\n\nMukut Bihari and Janmejai Singh, who have been elected from Kaisarganj and Deoria respectively, said they have no information about the meeting.\n\nApna Dal(S) leader and Union minister Anupriya Patel said very soon the people of UP would get their new CM.\n\nApna Dal(S) is an alliance partner of BJP-led NDA and has won 9 seats.\n\nModi, in one of his election speeches, had said that allies would get a chance in government when BJP came to power\n\nWith inputs from PTI and ANI"

        "body1": "After the high-steam civic polls in Mumbai last month, all eyes are now set on the elections to the three municipal corporations in the National Capital, which will be held on 22 April.\n\nWhile the municipal corporation polls are being seen as a popularity test for the ruling Aam Aadmi Party, they are a prestige issue for the BJP which will be looking to return to power for a third consecutive term. The political exercise will also grab eyeballs due to the political bickering between the Aam Aadmi Party led-Delhi government and the BJP led-Centre and the three civic bodies, both of which have been trading barbs as issues galore.\n\nImportant dates, facts and figures\n\nThe erstwhile unified Municipal Corporation of Delhi was trifurcated in 2012 \u2014 just ahead of the previous election \u2014 into North, South and East Municipal Corporation or NDMC, SDMC and EDMC respectively, which the BJP has been ruling since 2007.\n\nCounting for the polls will take place on 25 April while the nomination process will begin from the 27 of this month. 3 April would be the last date for filing nominations and the scrutiny of the nominations filed will take place on 5 April. State Election Commissioner SK Srivastava said that the last date for withdrawal of nomination is 8 April for 272 wards municipal elections.\n\nThe much-awaited polls will decide the fate of 272 councillors, with the NDMC and SMDC have 104 seats each, while the EDMC has 64 seats.\n\nThe total number of electorate for the civic polls stands at 1,32,10,206, which include 73,15,915 men, 58,93,418 women and 793 voters in the other category, the state election commission said.\n\nWith the announcement of the date for MCD polls, the Model Code of Conduct has come into force in the national capital.\n\nNumber of seats reserved for woman in North MCD is 42 while in South MCD is 45. East MCD has 27 seats reserved for women. According to the commission, around 17,000 personnel will be deployed for the polls. In North Delhi, 5,170 polling stations will be set up, while in SDMC and EDMC, 5,074 and 2,990 polling stations will be set up respectively.\n\nThe State Election Commission said that voters can exercise their franchise after producing photo electoral rolls, electors photo identity cards and photo voter slips. During poll campaigning, loudspeakers will not permitted at night between 10 pm and 6 am.\n\nAn election with many firsts\n\nAs Delhi prepares to choose its corporators, the elections will mark several firsts. AAP enters the fray for the first time transforming a thus far bipolar election into an intense three-way contest, although it also contested the MCD bypolls in 2016 and surpassed BJP, Congress in performance.\n\nYogendra Yadav and Prashant Bhushan's Swaraj India is another first-time entrant, however, the party's chances remain dim as it is locked in a legal battle with the State Election Commission which has denied to issue a common symbol for its candidates. Swaraj India was floated by Yadav and Bhushan, who were expelled from Aam Aadmi Party after they questioned Arvind Kejriwal's leadership.\n\nThis will also be the first time that the voters will be able to exercise the \"None of the Above\" (NOTA) option.\n\nThe State Election Commission has also increased the expenditure limit for a candidate from Rs 5 lakh to Rs 5.75 lakh, at a time when the Congress party is alleging that the BJP has hijacked the thrones of Manipur and Goa using \"money power.\"\n\nExpect high-drama politicking\n\nEven though the electioneering has not started, with BJP yet to announce its candidates, political bickering has started in the high-stake elections.\n\nThe upcoming polls are being seen as crucial for the AAP as it has \"failed\" to perform in Punjab and Goa elections. The BJP, which has been ruling all three MCDs for 10 years, is desperate to regain a third consecutive term. The Congress party on the other hand, sour with the recent defeat in the recent Assembly elections, will put all its might in trying to improve its performance in the civic polls.\n\nEarly signs of a high-drama polling exercise are already visible with the BJP dropping all its sitting councillors from the list of candidates, in what it terms a move to \"infuse fresh blood\" into civic body polls. The AAP on the other hand has expressed reservations about electronic voting machines (EVMs), after Mayawati alleged rigging in UP elections, seeking the use of ballot papers in the civic polls. The poll panel, however, has turned down the request stating that the time is less to entertain such a request. \"Voting through EVMs is very safe. And, if the polls are to be held through ballot then some of the rules have to be amended,\" the poll panel chief has said.\n\nMeanwhile, it is also expected that the recent electoral defeat that the AAP faced in Goa and Punjab may have bearings on its prospects in the civic polls in the national capital. While AAP Delhi convenor Dilip Pandey welcomed the announcement of poll dates and exuded confidence, another party leader requesting anonymity told PTI, \"Poor performance in the state is bound to dampen the party workers' spirit. We were expecting that the results in Punjab will give a shot in arm to the organisation in the MCD polls.\n\nThe AAP has already released a list of 248 candidates, with the BJP and Congress still choosing to hold their cards close to their chest.\n\nSwaraj India has also put out a list of 109 candidates, which it shortlisted after inviting applications from the masses and subjecting them to the scrutiny of a three-tier selection process.\n\nWith inputs from PTI",

        "body1": "As I found myself through most of last Saturday being battered in TV studios by the election results as they inexorably poured in, there was one illuminating moment when I suddenly understood what this election was about. Asked why the BJP had not found one candidate to contest any of 403 seats in UP, Swapan Dasgupta replied that it was perhaps because they were not able to find any Muslim who \"adhered\" to their programme.Amazing! Of 40 million Muslims in UP, who constitute about a quarter of the population of the state, the BJP were unable to find even one Muslim to field who, adhering to their programme, could win a seat for them. Yet, the BJP won 324 seats of 403. All those who did field Muslims lost badly, and those who won did so because they wrapped all Hindu communities into a single Hindu saffron flag. That was Savarkar's \"idea of India\" - the marginalization of the minorities to promote the unity of Hindu India. The UP outcome is the first major political triumph in nearly a century of the Hindutva Idea of the Indian nation. It is that which we have to fight. This moment of disaster is not, therefore, the moment to surrender. We have to remain in the contest. But how?The starting point is to underline that while both in 2014 at the all-India level, and now even more in UP/Uttarakhand, the BJP has made a clean sweep of the seats, our electoral system is such that a clear majority of the electorate - 69 per cent in 2014 and 58 per cent in UP in 2017 - did not fall for Modi, the BJP, or the ideology of Hindutva. This is not new, it is the nature of the system. It was the scattering of the non-BJP vote that handed a clear majority of seats to the BJP. Therefore, moving towards a higher Index of Opposition Unity might at present be the only feasible way of retaining the Idea of India that won us our Independence, and assured our unity and integrity over the initial decades of nation-building in independent India. The challenge is not one of merely winning another election to wrest power from the current dispensation, but of preserving the Idea of an inclusive India that has motivated our sense of nationhood since at least 1857, and certainly since the founding of the Congress in 1885.The differences of the Congress with several of those who have bitterly fought it all these years are, of course, real - but underlying these differences is a shared distaste for the kind of India that the saffron brigade stands for. The challenge today comes not from the Congress - that is no longer the natural party of governance - but from the forces that seek to secure the unity of Hindu India by \"othering\" those who fall outside the Hindu fold. It is the unacceptability of their undermining our Idea of India that provides the philosophical basis for uniting the alternative forces who do not accept the saffron concept of a Hindu India, but constitute together the majority of the Indian electorate both at the national and at the state levels.Till the Pachmarhi chintan shivir in 1998, the Congress believed in going it alone because it considered itself with reason as the \"natural party of governance\", a role it had won for itself during and in the aftermath of the Freedom Movement. Basically, this was because the Congress promoted the concept of an \"inclusive\" party in which all Indians had a place, none was excluded, anyone was welcome, and all interests were subsumed in a common drive towards freedom first, then building modern, post-Independence India. That was the secret of Mahatma Gandhi's success in wresting freedom, and then of the leadership of Jawaharlal Nehru, who had nurtured and given expression to the \"Idea of India\". His masterpiece, The Discovery of India, traced the evolution of our composite civilization over millennia and portrayed with magisterial brilliance the vital importance of including all sections of our society in the forging of our contemporary nationhood.Notwithstanding the trauma and communal horrors of Partition, the electorate responded avidly to this inclusive view of India, decisively rejecting in three successive general elections - 1952, 1957 and 1962 - the alternative sectarian or special interest views espoused by the Bharatiya Jana Sangh, the Hindu Mahasabha and several others, even though many of the latter were led by men of great eminence such as Rajaji, Ram Manohar Lohia, Jayaprakash Narayan, Acharya Narendra Dev, Chaudhury Charan Singh and CN Annadurai.That started changing from the fourth general election of 1967. Many of the hitherto marginalized parties of the Indian polity rose to the fore, so much so that it was said you could travel from Wagah on the West Pakistan border to Jessore on the East Pakistan border without traversing an inch of Congress territory. There were, of course, specific reasons for this huge change in the fortunes of the Congress, notably the dramatic defeat in the India-China war of 1962 and Nehru's demise two years later. But underlying the circumstantial reasons was the far more enduring fact that the Congress as an \"inclusive party\" was no longer attracting the kind of nation-wide endorsement it had enjoyed through the seven decades of the Freedom Movement and the first two decades of Independence. The constituent communities of the Congress accepted that while indeed they had been \"included\", they had not all been taken forward at an equitably equivalent pace. Some sections and some individuals had, indeed, blossomed and bloomed, but whole communities, such as the Other Backward Classes, had been left where they had been. Muslims had certainly received a measure of security, dignity, constitutionally-guaranteed rights and national acceptance that was astonishing, given the emotions stirred by the slicing off of Pakistan from Mother India, but in economic and social terms, they wallowed in worse conditions than before Independence and Partition, particularly because most well-off Muslims had departed for Pakistan with their carpet bags, leaving behind in India the vast majority of poor and very poor Muslims. But special attention to the special needs of this very deprived community attracted the charge that later led to the spiteful politics of 'mandir-masjid', 'tushtikaran' and 'vote-banks'. In the south, the Dravidian formations leveraged linguistic nationalism to definitively oust the \"inclusive\" Congress, starting a trend in language-based identity politics that has only gathered momentum into the 21st century, and now spans most of the east coast states and other non-Hindi-speaking regions.Thus, for the last half-century, the USP of the Congress as the sole \"party of inclusion\", encompassing all classes, all castes, all creeds, and all languages, has been chipped away. Specific events, such as Indira Gandhi's stunning election victories of 1971 and 1980, and Rajiv's massive win in 1984 after his mother's assassination, obscured, from time to time, the trend towards moving away from an \"inclusive\", all-India party towards avowedly exclusivist, identity-based formations. And since 1989-90, the Congress and its brand of \"inclusion\", as well as its claim to, and self-image of being, the \"natural party of governance\", has been slowly and surely eroded.This is at the heart of the existential crisis in which the party finds itself. Where the Congress sought, and still seeks to be, a party of everyone, many in our electorate believe it has therefore become a party of no one. The fractionating of the Indian polity has left the Congress picking up the left-overs. How fractionated is our polity is well-illustrated by the fact that while the Dravidian parties are totally dominant in Tamil Nadu, none of them can secure a seat in Andhra Pradesh; similarly, the Telugu Desam might carry all before it in AP, but cannot win a seat in Odisha; in Odisha, the Biju Janata Dal wins again and again and again, but cannot even contest a seat in West Bengal; in West Bengal, Didi rules but has not been able to encroach into neighbouring Bihar; in Bihar, Nitish is unbeatable from Purnea to Mughalsarai, but cannot win Varanasi on the other side of the Bihar-UP divide, despite the language being the same on both sides; equally, neither the Samajwadi Party nor the Bahujan Samaj Party have been able, in any meaningful sense, to cross the frontiers of Uttar Pradesh. This is why, even on its worst day (May 16, 2014), the Congress, despite its most terrible drubbing ever, emerged as the largest single party of the Opposition with a mere 44 seats in the Lok Sabha. This points to the need to replace, at least for the present, a single \"inclusive party\" with a wide-ranging \"inclusive alliance\", a coalition of the willing, as it were, whose most important common bond that distinguishes them for Hindu nationalism is that they are jointly and severally committed to the quintessence of the \"Idea of India\", that is, the emotional integration of the Muslim and other minority communities within the composite nationhood of India.This is precisely what Sonia Gandhi achieved when in 2004 she led her \"party of inclusion\" into a \"coalition of inclusion\" - the UPA, a rainbow coalition comprising most of the votaries of special interest politics. It so successfully ran UPA-I that the voters rewarded the alliance with a second successive victory in 2009 that carried the Congress from about 140 seats in 2004 to a new high of 206 in 2009. The existential crisis of \"inclusive politics\" through the dominance of a single national party was overcome by giving a ten-year further lease of life to \"inclusive politics\" through an alliance of parties that provided a stable government for a full decade. It was the unraveling of that coalition in 2014, with the Congress fighting it all alone, that brought on not only its own crushing defeat, but that of its erstwhile partners as well. Opposition disunity, not the Modi miracle, was the fundamental cause of the BJP's stunning victory with only 31 per cent of the electorate voting for them. This has now been repeated in UP, where the BJP has won over three-quarters of the seats, but with an overwhelming majority of 58 percent of UP's voters decisively rejecting the BJP. If the Bihar victory has not been replicated, it is precisely because Bihar saw a Mahagathbandan (a Grand Alliance), while UP witnessed a mere gathbandan (a partial alliance). Where Nitish and Lalu came together in Bihar, Mayawati remained separated from Akhilesh. The BJP was thus able to sneak past both (and the Congress), taking the breath away from most its opponents.What, therefore, is now required is a restoration of the spirit of 2004. Inclusive India lost in 2014 because the rainbow alliance of the decade 2004-2014 withered away. What could restore Inclusive India is for the UPA's rainbow alliance to come together again. There are, admittedly, many hurdles in the way - but not many more than there were in 2004 when \"India Shining\" seemed to be holding sway. Then, it was a bogus publicity campaign that needed to be stopped. Now, far more seriously, it is the undermining of the Idea of India that needs to be stopped. The incentive to come together is stronger than it was even in 2004.Also, it is only after this strategic objective is clearly spelt out that tactical issues relating to the composition of the alliance, the sharing of seats, and the nature of the leadership need to be tackled. Sonia Gandhi did it then; Rahul Gandhi needs to do it now.Even more important than promoting the composite alliance is for the Congress to put its own house in order. What Congressmen and women need to do is hark back to a long-forgotten Presidential Address by Jawaharlal Nehru to the Lucknow Congress in 1936:\"We have largely lost touch with the masses and, deprived of the life-giving energy that flows from them, we dry up and weaken, and our organization shrinks and loses the power it had.\"What an accurate description of the Congress in 2017! We have largely lost touch with the masses; we have dried up and weakened; our organization has shrunk - and so we have lost the power we once had! Yet, within a few months of his doleful assessment of the condition of the Congress in 1936, Nehru led the party to a massive victory in the first-ever general elections held in 1937. He did so by renewing the Congress as a mass movement and re-hauling the organization of the party. Nehru, within months, brought the party back to \"the power it once had\". Of course, we no longer have a Jawaharlal, and, of course, we no longer have a Mahatma - so what took the Congress a few months in 1936-37 will take us many years to accomplish now.Meanwhile, there are elections to be fought and the nation won urgently back to the inclusive path. For that, Nehru's analysis of 1936 needs to be combined with Sonia Gandhi's pragmatism of 2004. We must needs move in the present context from being a \"party of inclusion\" to becoming once again a \"coalition of inclusion\".Fortunately for the Congress, it does not have to reinvent the wheel. Gathering dust in its mouldy shelves at 24, Akbar Road are a series of \"introspection reports\" going all the way back to Uma Shankar Dikshit's monumental thesis of the late 1980s that the Congress Working Committee endorsed in full on 4 April, 1990 and the AICC plenary adopted in July 1990. There is also the first AK Antony report - an Encyclopaedia Congressica - covering every state and Union Territory. Some of its more radical recommendations were rejected, but most of its organizational suggestions were endorsed. The same holds for Antony II and Antony III. Digvijaya Singh was, in my view, quite right when he emphasized on the day of our mammoth defeat that \"the time for introspection is over, the time for action is now.\" Rahul Gandhi has since outlined much the same theme in his statement at parliament. Let's not waste any time crying over spilt milk. Let us move, both strategically and tactically, to giving back to the people of India their sense of our millennial nationhood that is being insidiously stolen from them by forces that cannot find one electable candidate who \"adheres \" to their programme from among 200 million of our fellow-citizens.India is great because despite being 85 percent Hindu, we have among us the world's second-largest Muslim population, making it as impossible in the 21st century to conceive of India without Islam as it is to conceive of Islam without India.Jai Hind!(Mani Shankar Aiyar is former Congress MP, Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha.)", 
        "body0": "NEW DELHI: Amid growing calls for restructuring the Congress after its debacle in UP, senior leader Mani Shankar Aiyar today stressed on the need for forging a \"grand alliance\" as the party \"cannot defeat BJP and Modi alone\".Aiyar called for forging fresh alliances to take on the BJP and strengthening the party by bringing in young leaders.\"It is very clear that Congress cannot alone take on the BJP. It would be foolish to say that today Congress can alone defeat Modi. But one would be sensible to say that after such results we can win and will win in 2019 polls by fighting him unitedly by forging alliances,\" he said.We have to admit that on the basis of seats, it has been BJP's victory, Aiyar said.\"I feel that on the basis of seats, we have suffered a very big loss. But it is not that people have voted for Modi in 2017 or even in 2014, as more than 69 per cent did not vote for Modi in 2014 and around 59 per cent have not voted for him in 2017 in Uttar Pradesh,\" he said.About Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi, he said he faced no challenge from within the party. Admitting that the Congress' space in national politics was shrinking, he said there was a need to bring in fresh young faces, including those from different regions, in leadership role.\"Forming alliance to take on Modi is the best way and the most assured way. However, it is not the only way. There will be difficulties on the way. It is not neccessary that every party should be in it. We must approach a mahagathbhandan (grand alliance) to the extent possible,\" the former Union minister said.The grand alliance could then decide who its leader would be, he said, without clearly mentioning whether Rahul Gandhi should helm it or someone else.Aiyar also wrote a blog wherein he underscored the need for reviving the spirit of 2004 when the UPA I led by Congress, was backed by the Left Front, Samajwadi Party and Bahujan Samaj Party during various phases of its stint in power.\"What, therefore, is now required is a restoration of the spirit of 2004. Inclusive India lost in 2014 because the rainbow alliance of the decade 2004-2014 withered away. What could restore Inclusive India is for the UPA's rainbow alliance to come together again,\" Aiyar said.\"Also, it is only after this strategic objective is clearly spelt out that tactical issues relating to the composition of the alliance, the sharing of seats, and the nature of the leadership need to be tackled. Sonia Gandhi did it then; Rahul Gandhi needs to do it now,\" he said.Aiyar, however, insisted it was even more important for Congress to put its house in order than promoting a composite alliance.Aiyar said, \"Rahul Gandhi has since outlined much the same theme in his statement in Parliament. Let's not waste any time crying over spilt milk.\"At the AICC briefing, party general secretary C P Joshi said the entire political narrative changed after 2014 elections and posed new challenges to face which the party needed to align with other parties across the country to take on the BJP.He sought to defend Rahul Gandhi against criticism, saying he played a significant role in bringing together various parties in Bihar to BJP.\"You have to assess the qualities and leadership of Rahul Gandhi. By the end of 2018 you will see structural changes in the party and some new young faces will come in the party. We assure you that under the leadership of Rahul Gandhi we will face the new narrative and we will deliver 2019.\"We will do everything, look at state-specific challenges. We will see to it that we will in 2019 give a formidable challenge to Prime Minister Narendra Modi under the leadership of Rahul Gandhi,\" he said.He said Congress will have tie-ups in every state \"wherever we can give a challenge to Narendra Modi. We will explore all possibilities\".",
