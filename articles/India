        "body1": "Apple has announced the successor to the iPad Air 2. It isn't called the Air 3, but instead just '9.7-inch iPad'. Here's what you need to know about its price, specs and release date in the UK. See also: Best tablet 2017.\n\nThe new iPad 9.7 was announced in a press release alongside a slightly updated iPad mini 4.\n\nClick here to read the latest version of this article.\n\nWhen is the new iPad 9.7 release date?\n\niPad Air 3 release date: 27-31 March\n\nYou can pre-order a 9.7-inch iPad from 24 March. They will go on sale in Apple stores 'next week'. That could mean as soon as 27 March, or as late as 31 March. In any case, there's not long to wait if you're itching to buy one.\n\nHow much will the new iPad cost in the UK?\n\nWe expected the new iPad to cost \u00a3399 for the Wi-Fi-only 32GB base model - Apple's standard price for the full-size iPad. But the tablet actually costs \u00a3339, which is the lowest price for a new 10in iPad.\n\nIf you want more storage, there's a 128GB version which costs \u00a3429.\n\nThe Wi-Fi + Cellular model costs \u00a3469 for the 32GB model. Pricing for the 128GB 4G version is not yet known.\n\nAll models are available in Silver, Gold and Space Grey. There's no Rose Gold option.\n\nSee also: iPad mini 5 release date, price and spec rumours\n\nWhat's new about the iPad 9.7-inch?\n\nWe didn't expect Apple to change the design of the iPad when it launched the iPad Air 2, but the company surprised us by making the already thin and light device even slimmer. It's 6.1mm thick compared with the 7.5mm of the original iPad Air.\n\nThe new iPad 9.7-inch has returned to that 7.5mm thickness, possibly using exactly the same chassis as the original Air (it looks the same in Apple's photos). The main upgrade is the A9 processor with embedded M9 co-processor. This is the chip originally seen first in the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus. We are assuming that Apple has increased its speed for use in the new iPad, but it never releases these figures officially.\n\nThe only other change is that the screen is now brighter. Apple hasn't said how much brighter, and doesn't quote a figure in the Tech Specs section on its website. Resolution remains the same at 2048x1536 pixels, meaning a 264ppi pixel density. The True Tone screen didn't make it to this low-cost iPad and is one reason to pay more for the Pro model.\n\nNaturally, the tablet will come with iOS 10.\n\nPodcast discussion", 
        "body0": "Apple rolled out a new tablet in the wee hours today, dropping the Air designation as well as any numbering scheme and calling it simply iPad. The $329 device will go on sale Friday but in the meantime, the new iPad raises almost as many questions as it answers.\n\nApple\n\nFirst the good stuff\n\nWith last year's A9 processor and a base configuration of 32GB, the new iPad should get the job done for almost everyone. This isn't intended to be a power-uses tablet. For that, we'll apparently have to wait for upgraded iPad Pros at some future date, likely using A10X processors with graphics speed that will exceed iPhone 7. Because iPad now starts at $329 ($429 with 128GB) and has adequate specs for the majority of applications, it makes Apple even more competitive in tablets. The company's market share in the $200+ segment was already dominant and this can only help.\n\nNext, the grim reality\n\nWhat the new iPad won't do, though, is solve two Apple problems with tablet. First, the fact they seem to have upgrade cycles about as long as PCs these days. That's a function both of the lack of compelling new hardware features and the generally outstanding build quality of iPad. But for Apple, that has meant a near-endless string of lower sales quarters for its tablet. Yes, lower prices could help reverse that trend. No, they won't catalyze a tablet boom.\n\nThe reason is that the software issues that keep iPad from replacing PCs for many users aren't going to be resolved soon. From my personal pet peeve -- that cut-and-paste is just awful -- to the lack of some critical apps or functions for others, iPad remains something of a tweener. It is likely tomorrow's personal computer but today's is still a laptop.\n\nThen, the hope\n\nClearly, Apple's decision to price iPad aggressively has especially critical implications for the education sector. Apple has been losing ground to Chromebooks, the stripped down machines powered by Google's software. With a $299 price for education, Apple is taking aim at Google's inroads especially in K-12. Realistically, this move closes the gap but doesn't eliminate it. Chromebooks can be had in bulk for significantly under $200 each and that includes a keyboard. An iPad with one will still run about twice as high. But Apple is showing a new aggressiveness here. It's worth watching how seriously the company goes after schools, which once built the Mac business.\n\nWhy everyone didn't get the far-more attractive $299 price has to do with Apple's penchant for trading incremental margin for what is likely disproportionate lower volumes. But that's a different topic for another day.\n\nMissing in action\n\nApple has finally retired the less-expensive iPad Mini 2, which actually had been the entry-level product at $269. Of course, it's a much older, and smaller, device with just 7.9-inches of screen vs. 9.7 for the \"full-size\" iPad. That made it less attractive for schools and less attractive as a small device period. For most looking at just an e-reader / small video device, Amazon offers increasingly nice tablets for far less than Apple -- starting well below $100. Apple still has the Mini 4, but it seems headed for the dustbin of history soon enough. Priced at $399 and up, it's mysteriously far more expensive than the new iPad despite sporting inferior specs.\n\nIt does outpoint the new iPad in pixels per inch and possibly in screen quality as the larger brother conspicuously is missing both the fully laminated display and anti-reflective coating of other iPads. Still the new 9.7-inch model does have a better processor than Mini 4, which is likely going to be the worst seller of the line even compared to the $799-and-up 12.9-inch iPad Pro.\n\nSpeaking of which, Apple clearly has future iPad plans for upgrades to both Pro models but they weren't ready to roll them out today. Many rumors have suggested the smaller 9.7-inch Pro was headed for a 10.5-inch, nearly bezel-free design possibly without a dedicated home button. Perhaps both Pros are going to that design -- but not yet.\n\nOn the offensive\n\nStill, even with just the one new model and some confusion around the fate of the Mini, Apple has continued its recent spate of aggressive pricing here. (See Apple Watch Series 1 and AirPods for other examples where the Cupertino crowd has turned the Apple tax into a discount. h/t Neil Cybart of Above Avalon.)\n\nThe bet seems now to be on getting more people into the Apple ecosystem at more attractive prices. Indeed, today's announcements also included a bump of the entry level iPhone SE to 32GB minimum while maintaining its $399 price tag. While Chromebook is the main target of the new iPad, Apple is also doubtless aware than Amazon has been eroded its position, especially with children. Frugal parents who are invested in Amazon's ecosystem anyway see the offerings from the e-commerce giant and often find them hard to resist.\n\nBut Apple has been playing the long game with iPad for a while now, with CEO Tim Cook constantly saying he believes in the product even as sales have waned in recent years. The new model might not be a game changer, but it should keep Apple atop the leaderboard for more than enough time to upgrade the Pros, iPad's software, and whatever else the company has on tap.\n\nFollow me on Twitter.

Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email\n\nThe iPad mini has been a firm favourite among tablet users for a few years now.\n\nThe bag-friendly little tablet was last given an upgrade in September 2015. And experts are speculating on whether or not it will be brought into the 'iPad Pro' fold in 2017.\n\nAs such, we could see the unveiling of an \"iPad Pro mini\" this year rather than the iPad mini 5. That could mean it comes with its own, smaller, version of the Apple Pencil stylus.\n\nHere's everything we know (or think we know) about the next mini iPad. Keep checking back as we'll update this page when we know more.\n\nLatest news\n\nSupply chain sources seem to be suggesting we could see the next iPad mini unveiled in a matter of days.\n\nApple doesn't publicise its events until the last second, but sources on its supply chain have been talking to Apple-focused site MacRumours .\n\n\"Apple is expected to announce new products later this month, most likely between Monday, March 20 and Friday, March 24, according to reputable supply chain analysts we spoke to who wish to remain anonymous,\" the site reported.\n\nUnfortunately, the sources stopped short of revealing exactly which products are to be revealed.\n\nApple's online store is currently down for scheduled \"maintenance\", suggesting the new iPad Mini is about to be unleashed.\n\nRelease date\n\n(Photo: Getty)\n\nApple almost certainly has a new version of the iPad mini ready to roll - even if production hasn't yet ramped up.\n\nAccording to Taiwan-based DigiTimes, which cites those ever-reliable unnamed \"supply chain workers\u201d, Apple started production in December 2016 for an early 2017 launch.\n\nTraditionally, Apple holds its first event of the year in March. Last year, Apple used an event in March to reveal the 9.7-inch iPad Pro.\n\nIt holds true that the company may take the same approach in 2017 and that would square nicely with the latest rumours mentioned above. However, Apple usually launches its products swiftly after revealing them.\n\nConceivably, the next iPad Mini could be available to buy by the middle of April.\n\nPrice\n\n(Photo: Getty)\n\nApple is expected to introduce a new iPad Mini at the current pricing and shift the iPad Mini 4 down the chain.\n\nThat would mean it would launch at \u00a3379 for the 32GB model and \u00a3469 for the 128GB version. Of course, when Apple does put up its prices, it does so nice and quiet-like. So we can\u2019t guarantee the same pricing, but it\u2019s a good base estimate.\n\nYou can also expect to add an extra \u00a3100 on top if you want to have 3G compatability.\n\nDesign\n\n(Photo: Getty)\n\nAccording to Neurogadget , the new iPad mini will only be 5mm thick, meaning Apple will have shaved 1.1mm off the iPad mini 4.\n\n\"This news has pleased some fans, but others are worried that a thinner body is not really the best idea, because the battery must be reduced in order to fit inside the carcass,\" writes the site.\n\nMeanwhile, other reports have suggested that Apple will trim the bezel around the edges of the tablet and introduce and OLED display for the first time. Broadly speaking, that means better colours because each pixel provides its own illumination rather than needing a backlight.\n\nWhat will be really interesting to see is whether Apple decides to echo the iPhone 7 and drop the headphone jack for the next iPad. There\u2019s been no reports of it so far but we\u2019ll update this piece if and when that changes.\n\nSpecs\n\nApple\u2019s newest iPads will undoubtedly be the most powerful yet.\n\nSeveral Apple specialist sites are suggesting the iPad mini 5 will come with an upgraded A9 processor. That means it'll run faster and there will be better graphics for gaming.\n\nHowever, the camera is heavily rumoured to stay the same. That means, there's likely to be an 8MP camera on the back and a 1.2MP camera on the front. But then again, if you're using a tablet to take pictures you've got bigger problems.\n\nAccording to Cult of Mac, there's a chance of a smaller battery being fitted to the iPad mini 5. This isn't necessarily a bad thing as battery tech has improved to a point where a smaller battery is still as efficient as last year's larger ones.",

Jain had visited a VHP training camp at Bokaro earlier.Calling the construction of the temple at Ayodhya a matter of national pride, Jain that it was the Mughal emperor Babur who had built the mosque over the Ram temple as a mark of his victory. He said: \"Babri masjid was a symbol of our defeat and shame. Building a temple at Ram Janmabhoomi will make the pseudo-secularists redundant and will be according to the Hindu wave that is sweeping the country. BJP's victory at the UP polls is an indication of this wave and the public sentiments. Building the temple will speed up development as it will put an end to jihad and sideline these pseudo-secularists.\"\"Construction of the Ram temple at the site where Babri masjid was built is essential to wipe out the symbol of slavery which Babur had imposed on us. Wiping out such symbols of slavery after achieving Independence has been practiced for long in various countries across the globe. In Warsaw, Petrograd, all symbols of dominance were removed as the people there rebuilt their churches in those places and when India gained independence the Somnath temple was built, in Delhi George Pancham's idol was replaced with that of Mahatma Gandhi and Queen Victoria's image was replaced with Swami Shraddhanand's idol.

He suggested the government should have brought a separate Bill for the purpose.\n\nLater, Communist Party of India (M) General Secretary Sitaram Yechury said several Bills had been smuggled into the Finance Bill; the move was a subversion of the Constitution, to bypass the Rajya Sabha as the was a money bill.\n\nThe Opposition\u2019s objections were overruled by Speaker Sumitra Mahajan, who ruled that the \u201cincidental provisions\u201d involved in the amendments constituted a money Bill and therefore could be considered as part of the Bill.\n\nDefending the amendments, Jaitley said if a substantial portion of a Bill dealt with imposition or abolition of taxes, then, even if it had incidental provisions, it could still be introduced as a money Bill. \u201cNo tax can be imposed without reference to courts or tribunals.

Agitations and a spate of suicides gripped the streets of Kolkata and suburbs and villages of Bengal as dozens of agents and depositors who lost their money ended their lives.\n\nThe ruling party of Bengal was not hit any less hard.

Both are behind bars.\n\nIt is speculated that a few more leaders may be summoned by the central agency for interrogation in the Rose Valley scam.\n\nWorse, the list is by no means over. Just a couple of days ago, CBI arrested Basudeb Bagchi and Avik Bagchi, father-son duo of Prayag Group who are behind a film city on 12,500 acre in Chandrakona in West Midnapore district. It is rumoured that ruling party leaders may be under the scanner even in this case.\n\nWhile Saradha sunk about Rs 2,500 crore, Rose Valley involved about Rs 17,000 crore, or six times the amount of Saradha.\n\nBengal\u2019s scam woes The handing over of probe into the Narada sting operation to CBI is another blow to Mamata Banerjee in the past three years.

It has allowed the people to see leaders accepting cash on TV -- a shock that Saradha and Rose Valley could not deliver. Two, the number of faces involved are far more than in the chit fund cases.\n\nLast year, another major controversy hit the Mamata Banerjee government was the collapse of the under-construction Vivekananda Road flyover in north Kolkata that killed 27 people on March 31, 2016. It was alleged that Trinamool leaders of the area supplied substandard building materials that were used in the construction.\n\nHowever, Kolkata Police investigated the case and filed the charge sheet in end June 2016 in which 10 engineers and officials of construction firm IVRCL were charged with criminal sections.

They can either make a partial withdrawal from all policy segments or they can do a complete closure of individual policy segments.\n\nThe tax implications can differ greatly in each scenario and often the customer is unaware of the implications.\n\nAs a general rule, Griffin explains, it may be more tax efficient to withdraw money, over and above the annual 5% allowance, through surrendering individual policy segments rather than part surrender.\n\nHowever, each case needs to be reviewed on its own merits, she cautioned.\n\nLobler case\n\nIf a customer asks for money to be withdrawn from across all policies, where this is in excess of their 5% tax deferred allowance, the customer could be faced with a significantly greater tax liability than would have otherwise been the case.\n\nMistakes can happen and may lead to extreme tax consequences which are completely disproportionate to the growth received on the investment, as in the case of Lobler.\n\nIn 2007, Joost Lobler, a Dutch national was ordered to pay $560,000 in tax on the $1.42m he withdrew from a policy he set up with Zurich Life just two years earlier.\n\nLobler took his case court and eventually won, which prompted the HMRC review.\n\nCase-by-case\n\nPublished Monday, the Finance Bill 2016/17 indicates that \u201cHMRC will consider each recalculation request on a case-by-case basis, and the threshold is set high in terms of what it will consider reasonable to correct\u201d, said Griffin.\n\n\u201cNo-one should rely on this as a safety net, and policyholders should carefully consider how they take money out of a life insurance policy to avoid invoking an unnecessary and disproportionate tax charge.\n\n\u201cOne positive change announced in the Finance Bill is that policyholders will have a period of four tax years following the tax year the gain was made in to request a recalculation of the gain by HMRC, in previously draft legislation this was two years.\n\n\"This will give policyholders plenty of time to realise an error has been made and for them to gather the required information to request a recalculation by HMRC,\u201d Griffin said.",

Since the RBI will authorise a particular bank to issue the electoral bonds, the RBI Act will also be amended.\n\nMeanwhile, Opposition parties including TMC, BJD and RSP protested against the number of amendments.\n\nJaitley justified his proposals saying, \u201cyou cannot have a bill which says government will spend \u20b9100,000 crore without detailing how it would be spent. You cannot have a bill where you say there will be 5% without specifying what will be the deduction, what will be the power of assessing officer, appeal provision. No tax can be imposed without reference to courts or tribunals. These are incidental provisions.\u201d",

And Anupam Kher, who played the doom-and-gloom Shuklaji in both the films, has a suggestion to make \u2014 why not make Naam Shukla next. The man is a wizard with a computer in both the films but that is not why Anupam wants a full-fledged film on Shukla. His reasons are very different and very hilarious. \u201cNaam Shabana is one of a kind film, which has never been attempted before. A character from a film (Baby) being transformed into a full-fledged commercial film, this gives me an optimistic hope that one day they will also make Naam Shukla. I would like to know from Neeraj (Pandey) why Shukla wears a wig,\u201d Anupam Kher says with a smile.\n\nThe 61-year-old says that Naam Shabana is an exciting concept and hopes it inspires other filmmakers to experiment with their films, \u201cNeeraj is a fine writer. The script is very important. I\u2019m sure it will do really well. We do compare films with Hollywood and they are our benchmark but I think we have our own take on films. We hope this film encourages people to explore more of such concepts.\u201d\n\nSpeaking about the kind of spy he would like to play, the actor rues how the Hindi film industry does not have a legendary detective figure like Sherlock Holmes or James Bond. He said, \u201cI would make a funny spy film like Pink Panther. Such characters are strongly etched in my mind. As a schoolboy, I used to read a lot of Hindi detective novels like Ved Prakash Sharma, Colonel Ranjit and many others. In terms of English, I would read all the commercial writers. But whatever I have seen of Pink Panther, that would be interesting to portray.\u201d\n\nIn terms of spy movies, Anupam feels Bollywood has a lot of catching up to do. \u201cMy character in Naam Shabana is a technical agent who gets things done through the computer and can easily get information by cracking some codes. However, we have to agree that our assumption of a detective is somebody who follows someone or tries to solve a mystery, you know we have strong James Bond kind of association. Real detectives are not so fascinating, they are very normal people. In all the films we are talking about, detectives are so noticeable, usually, it\u2019s the opposite way. In Sherlock Holmes, you spot the detectives from a mile away. These are celebrated detectives. But those who work with agencies like RAW, FBI and all, they can mix with the crowd whenever they want. We (Indian film industry) don\u2019t have a legendary detective figure except for Byomkeysh Bakshi. In India, this sphere is not yet explored properly. There are no original heroes. We don\u2019t have a James Bond kind character yet. Maybe in the future, we will.\u201d\n\nNaam Shabana is also special because, despite such supportive strong characters, it is Taapsee who leads the film. Anupam Kher feels it has a lot to do with the opportunity that has come her way. \u201cIf Neeraj wouldn\u2019t have thought to make the film, this wouldn\u2019t have happened. There are films like Kahaani, Mardaani and all, in the eighties and nineties, Madhur and Sridevi portrayed so many women-driven films\u2026 these films were always being made but the ratio has always been comparatively very low. Strong women have always got strong roles,\u201d he continues adding how CBFC\u2019s ban on women-centric films is purely unfortunate. \u201cThere are many issues which shouldn\u2019t happen. But why to look at negative? Look at where women are today. Women are in front making our country proud. They are doing amazing work. But to say that it (ban on women-centric film) is happening only in India is not true. It has a lot to do with the society. I am being optimistic and trying to change rather than pointing at the problem.\u201d\n\nAlso read | Naam Shabana most obvious step for Baby franchise: Neeraj Pandey\n\nKher also voiced his opinion on Padmavati row, \u201cThe violence is sad. But also, we should not give these people the mileage they are being given because somewhere we have to understand that the attention is making them excited and giving them power that they can do whatever they want.\u201d\n\nFor all the latest Entertainment News, download Indian Express App now\n\n\u00a9 The Indian Express Online Media Pvt Ltd",

The top court was not in agreement with Sahara\u2019s counsel senior advocate Kapil Sibal that the amount should be realised in accordance with the roadmap provided by the group, which suggested the deadline of July 2019 will be adhered to.\n\n\u201cNo small token amounts,\u201d the bench observed, adding that the balance amount of over Rs 14,000 crore can be realised by public auction of Sahara\u2019s unencumbered properties which are free from litigations, mortgage and any charge.\n\n\u201cThe fundamental question is that the court (Supreme Court) found that the money collected by you from XYZ etc was in violation of the rule,\u201d the bench observed while not accepting Sibal\u2019s plea that he should be given at least a minimum of two hours to explain that the apex court judgement against Sahara was \u201cex-facie erroneous\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a question of a core verdict,\u201d the bench said, while referring to the August 2012 judgement by which the Sahara Group was asked to make refund to the investors.\n\nSibal said the court should refrain from passing any order as the review petition against the August 2012 judgement was pending and he would demonstrate the \u201cerror on the face of the records\u201d.\n\nThe bench, which was not impressed with his contentions, said, \u201cYou talk about the attachment of the property. We have no option. You give the list of unencumbered properties which are good enough to bring Rs 14,000 crore. Then we will let you (take back) the Aamby Valley (property) and we will hear you.\u201d\n\nThe bench also said the question of consideration of the interest amount would be taken up after the principal amount has been realised.\n\nWhen the Sahara Group pleaded that it should be given an opportunity to explain its case to satisfy the court that its orders were erroneous, the bench said, \u201cThere is no question of going back.\u201d\n\nSibal submitted that there was a need for \u201cbreathing time\u201d for making the payment and contended that no bank or investor was claiming the money from Sahara Group.\n\nThe senior advocate also raised the issue of demonetisation and liquidity crunch in generating the money. It was following this submission, that the bench asked him to make effort for public auction of the unencumbered properties and expressed its intention of seeking placing a list of properties which are free from litigation and mortgage.\n\nWhile the bench was deliberating on the issue of the list of properties and wanted to know about the Aamby Valley, senior advocate Shekhar Naphade, who is assisting the court as amicus curiae, and SEBI counsel, said the hill resort was approximately worth Rs 39,000 crore.\n\nThe bench noted that the SEBI counsel and Naphade were of the view that the Aamby Valley property was substantial for realising the amount and they favoured its attachement as such a move would press Roy and other directors to endeavour for depositing the amount in the SEBI-Sahara account. This was opposed by Sibal.\n\nHowever, the bench said, it was convinced that the property should be ordered to be attached.\n\nDuring the hearing, Sibal said if the bench was dealing with the issue of Aamby Valley what was the need for seeking a list of properties. When he raised the issue of demonetisation and sought more time to arrange the money, the bench said, \u201cEither you speed up or we will go for your property.\u201d \u201cWe are talking about attachment when we have no option. So, give us the list of properties which are good enough to bring Rs 14,000 crore,\u201d it said.\n\nThe bench had at the last hearing granted liberty to the Sahara Group chief to transfer 35 million pounds, equivalent to Rs 285 crore, deposited in a bank in London to SEBI-Sahara account as part of Rs 600 crore payment required to be made. That order was complied with today.\n\nThe apex court had on November 28 last year asked Roy to deposit Rs 600 crore more by February 6 in the SEBI-Sahara refund account to remain out of jail and warned that failure to do so would result in his return to prison.\n\nThe apex court had on May 6, 2016 granted a four-week parole to Roy to attend the funeral of his mother. His parole has been extended by the court ever since.\n\nRoy was sent to Tihar Jail on March 4, 2014. During the last hearing, the bench had scrutinised the repeated extension of Roy\u2019s parole and said too much indulgence had been shown to him by the court.\n\nBesides Roy, two other directors \u2013 Ravi Shankar Dubey and Ashok Roy Choudhary \u2013 were arrested for the failure of Sahara group\u2019s two companies \u2013 Sahara India Real Estate Corporation (SIRECL) and Sahara Housing Investment Corp Ltd (SHICL) \u2013 to comply with the court\u2019s August 31, 2012 order to return Rs 24,000 crore to their investors.
