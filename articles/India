        "PSG dominated Barcelona on Tuesday in the Champions League Round of 16 first leg, as Angel Di Maria scored twice in a 4-0 victory. The French giants, who have had their fair share of trouble with Barca in recent editions of the competition, thoroughly outplayed the Spanish club from start to finish to secure the impressive yet mostly unexpected result.\n\nWith its high pressure confusing the Barca defense and its sound marking resulting in Lionel Messi, Neymar and Luis Suarez doing next to nothing, the capital club has one foot in the quarterfinals after securing one of the biggest results in its history.\n\nHere's what you need to know.\n\nFirst half\n\nThe first half (the game, actually) was all PSG. Barcelona didn't look anything like its normal, dangerous, world class self as PSG outclassed the visitors with a very high and aggressive press, time and time again and took a 2-0 lead into the break.\n\nBarcelona were stripped of their usual dominance of possession and did not have a reaction for it as PSG got more and more comfortable as the game wore on.\n\nPSG threatened a handful of times against an uninspired Barca defense, and it was Di Maria who got things going with a brilliant free kick goal on 18 minutes.\n\nBirthday boy Angel Di Maria spreads the love on #Valentines Day with this free kick goal vs Barcelona. üíôüíô #UCLhttps://t.co/jd7y1BqG8h ‚Äî FOX Soccer (@FOXSoccer) February 14, 2017\n\nJulian Draxler then made it 2-0 late in the first half with a fine strike on the right side of the box, leaving Barcelona stunned.\n\nJulian Draxler this season:\n\n\n\n0 goals in 14 matches for Wolfsburg.\n\n5 goals in 9 matches for PSG. üò≥ #PSGFCB#UCLhttps://t.co/ETnEg8z6QC ‚Äî FOX Soccer (@FOXSoccer) February 14, 2017\n\nIf it weren't for Barca goalkeeper Marc-Andre Ter Stegen, it could have been 3-0 or 4-0 at the half, but PSG still entered the break with an impressive lead.\n\nSecond half\n\nIt was more of the same. PSG knocked on the door often and got another unbelievable goal from Di Maria before the hour mark to make it 3-0.\n\nCan you feel the love, Paris?\n\n\n\nDi Maria is going OFF on #Valentines Day, breaking Barcelona's hearts. #PSGFCB#UCLhttps://t.co/j9gHtsVe1I ‚Äî FOX Soccer (@FOXSoccer) February 14, 2017\n\nEdinson Cavani then scored on 70 minutes off a lovely counter attack to complete the dominant scoreline.

It was his birthday, and he scored two magical goals that he will never forget.\n\nWhat this result means\n\nIt means Barcelona is likely on its way out of the Champions League. Sure, this team can come back and do the same to PSG in the return leg, but it did nothing on Tuesday to show it could. PSG has to feel great about its chances of advancing.\n\nNo team has ever come back from 4-0 down in the aggregate score in Champions League history.\n\nWhen is the return leg?\n\nMarch 8 at 2:45 p.m. ET from Camp Nou in Barcelona, Spain.\n\nRelive the match with our live blog below.",

(Source: Reuters)\n\n‚ÄúWhat just happened?‚Äù is what everyone except PSG fans watching this match would have been thinking. PSG may be a team that could rival Barcelona in the transfer market but they were never considered equal to the Catalan giants on the pitch. Today, they have absolutely smashed that notion out of the park.\n\nThe birthday boys Edinson Cavani and Angel Di Maria are on the score sheet alongwith Julian Draxler, making his Champions League debut with PSG. Another standout performer has been 21-year-old French full back Adrien Rabiot who, alongwith Marco Verratti managed to keep a lid on the fabled Barcelona mid field.\n\nIf any team can score at least four goals in 90 minutes to win a match, it is Barcelona and that is exactly what they will need to do when they host their conquerors at the Nou Camp. They have turned around a two-goal deficit earlier in 2013 when they won the return leg 4-2. That was against an AC Milan side that was slowly dipping in stature in Europe. This is against a resurgent PSG.\n\n0005 hrs IST: The UEFA Champions League is back and off with a cracker. On one hand PSG host Catalan giants Barcelona. Barca have recently found a resurgence in their league form chiefly due to their fabulous ‚ÄòMSN‚Äô trio‚Äôs contributions up front. Coupled with a formidable defensive line led by Gerard Pique, Barca will be looking to show that they are the dominant side even when up against the cash rich Paris St. Germain, who themselves have seen a spike in their domestic form.\n\nBorrusia Dortmund have had a two-faced season. On one hand, they will have to be content with fighting for Champions League spots in the Bundesliga after dropping out of the title race long time back. On the other, they have been enjoying a scintillating run in Europe so far and have entered the Round of 16 as winners of their group ahead of Real Madrid.\n\n0045 hrs IST: Team News, Barca XI: Ter Stegen, Piqu√©, Busquets, Iniesta, Su√°rez, Messi, Neymar, Alba, S.

Andres Iniesta is the man with the armband for Barcelona and Blaise Matuidi leads PSG.\n\n0117 hrs IST: At Lisbon, Benfica and Dortmund have kicked off with Benfica earning an early corner. It comes to nothing and Dortmund broke away with a quick counter. It seemed like they would make it count but Benfica managed to clear the final shot taken by Aubameyang\n\n0120 hrs IST: Barcelona had a free kick that was swung into the box by Lionel Messi. Busquets was the target but PSG managed to clear it and broke away with he counter. They had outnumbered Barca in their own half and Andre Ter Stegen did some intelligent sweeping job for the Catalans.\n\n0122 hrs IST: PSG are dominating play and Edinson Cavani had probably the best chance of the match. Julian Draxler lofted the ball to Cavani who came in behind Sergi Roberto. The Uruguayan was offside but the flag stayed down. Roberto then held his ground and blocked the shot.\n\n0125 hrs IST: At Lisbon, Dortmund took the ball from Benfica at a dangerous part of the pitch. Aubameyang was unmarked and had ample space through the middle and received the ball but in the end skied the shot.\n\n0130 hrs IST: That was another good chance for PSG when Matuidi managed to get into a relatively empty Barca box from the left. He took the shot and it would have gone in had it not been for a sensational one-handed save from Andre Ter Stegen. PSG have Barca on the ropes\n\n0133 hrs IST: Neymar seems to have a niggle. Meanwhile Julian Draxler is brought down just outside the box Umtiti. It‚Äôs taken by Di Maria and he SCORES! A beautiful free kick that was curled behind the wall and Ter Stegen who has done a fine job so far, stood no chance. PSG are leading Barcelona and it is an indication of how the match has gone thus far. They have pulled ahead in the 17th minute.\n\n0139 hrs IST: The first real opening that Barca had. Neymar avoids a challenge that came on him and ran into space towards the centre. He then found Andre Gomes who got in behind the PSG defence line and was in the clear. He couldn‚Äôt keep the shot away from the keeper.\n\n0148 hrs IST: 30 mins have gone by and it‚Äôs PSG 1-0 Barcelona. The home side have been the dominant team as the scoreline shows. Barca have just started to get the ball into the good areas with Neymar being their best player in attack so far. But overall, Barca have been saved from being embarassed in this first half hour by Andre Ter Stegen.\n\n0156 hrs IST: GOAL!! Julian Draxler scores in the 39th minute. They have been devastating on the counter with Draxler and Di Maria using their pace to catch out the Barca defence. Both of them are now on the score card. Draxler has already scored his fifth goal since his move, but this one has to be the special one for him.\n\n0201 hrs IST: That‚Äôs half time!! PSG lead Barca by two goals to none. It has been a first half that few would have expected would pan out in this manner but it has. Only Neymar has been able to do anything meaningful with the ball as both Messi and Suarez have been pretty much anonymous in this first half. Can Luis Enrique inspire his side into performing the way we know them to in the second half?\n\n0207 hrs IST: At Lisbon, its goalless at half time but that doesn‚Äôt tell the story of the match. Dortmund have been dominant and Pierre Emerick Aubameyang has had some very good chances thus far.\n\n0217 hrs IST: The teams have come out. PSG have a spring in their steps while Barca have scowls on their faces. Barca immediately give away a free kick. Its not come to anything but the visitors had to do some more nervous defensive work before the danger was gone.\n\n0222 hrs IST: Benfica have score in Lisbon, the home side have been dominant since the second half began and have been rewarded with a goal. Mitroglou is the man with the goal in the 48th minute. He headed in a lose ball that came off the keeper‚Äôs gloves from a free kick into the empty net.\n\n0227 hrs IST: GOAL!! Di Maria (54‚Ä≤), an absolute belter!! PSG are not letting go of it and are pummeling the Barcelona defence. Di Maria got the ball some way outside the box at the end of another quick counter attack. He went for it and it curl into the top half of the net. Di Maria is reminding Barcelona what they used to face in El Clasico‚Äôs\n\n0233 hrs IST: Angel Di Maria goes off to a standing ovation. The Argentine has scored two stunners to put PSG ahead and the man to replace him is Brazilian Lucas.\n\n0241 hrs IST: Marco Verratti has come off for PSG as the midfielder had went down. Unai Emery does not take any chances and replaces him immediately. Verratti has been instrumental so far in keeping Iniesta and Messi at bay.\n\n0243 hrs IST: GOAL!! Edinson Cavani (72‚Ä≤). Another counter attack and Cavan manages to get the ball with Pique, for a change unable to get to him in time. Cavani almost caressed the ball to Ter Stegen‚Äôs left and it goes into goal. This is turning out to be a dream night for PSG and a Parisian nightmare for the Catalan giants, who are now facing a real possibility of a Round of 16 exit from the Champions League.\n\n0253 hrs IST: Barcelona‚Äôs attacking super powers have been completely undone. It has been a rare lacklustre performance from Messi who is now trying to work something out for Barcelona.

Just a reminder to PSG that they are facing Barcelona after all.\n\n0258 hrs IST: The Parc des Princes rises once again as Julian Draxler is taken off.

This includes a penalty from Pierre Emerick Aubameyang that was saved by the home team goalkeeper.\n\n0303 hrs IST: Barcelona got a free kick from just outside, almost from where Di Maria scored the first goal in the first half. Neymar was the man who took it and was unable to emulate the Argentine and hits it over. It has not been Barca‚Äôs night.\n\n0306 hrs IST: It has ended and the score is, believe it or not, Paris St. Germain 4-0 Barcelona. The full time whistle also goes off at Lisbon with Benfica managing to hold off Borrusia Dortmund to win the first leg 1-0.\n\n¬© The Indian Express Online Media Pvt Ltd",
