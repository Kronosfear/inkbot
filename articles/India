opponents  Mauricio Pochettino s team had beaten Stoke 4 0 in their two previous meetings and it took only one half for them to reach that score here  as Harry Kane struck three goals before inviting Dele Alli to hit another  If Wembley spooks Spurs  the sight of Stoke City jerseys cheers them right up   Spurs  in fairness  have clobbered most opponents at White Hart Lane this season  their tally for the Premier League campaign now standing at 11 wins and two draws from 13 matches  But few visitors have been as obliging as Stoke  who  seemingly unrefreshed by a break in Dubai began as if expecting another trouncing  That was a self fulfilling attitude that made them ideal opponents for a Spurs team eager to reassert their top team credentials after flopping out of Europe at Wembley   Tottenham Hotspur v Stoke City  Premier League   as it happened Read more   We never really got out of the traps   admitted Mark Hughes   We talked about having a bright start but that didn t materialise for us  Unfortunately we were a little bit too passive  At times we were just a little bit awestruck and had a little bit too much respect for them  Maybe some of the players had scars from the previous performances  against Spurs  but they shouldn t have because we have been in good form recently    The first sign of Stoke docility came in only the fourth minute  when Christian Eriksen nutmegged Ryan Shawcross in the box and rolled the ball across the face of goal  Fortunately for Stoke there was no Tottenham player there to complete a tap in but it was not long before Spurs players were infiltrating the area in swarms  Shawcross  for years the most formidable of sentinels for Stoke  was particularly discombobulated and Spurs  opening goal was a result of his confusion  As the defender tried to tidy up following another incursion by Eriksen in the 14th minute  Kane nicked the ball off him and lashed in a low shot from 15 yards   Stoke attempted to stammer a retort and  in fairness  presented a cogent argument in the 24th minute in the form of a flowing move down the left involving Ramadan Sobhi and Erik Pieters  Peter Crouch nearly topped that off with a telling finish from four yards but Hugo Lloris had the last word with a superb save   If that had gone in it might have stirred us from our slumbers   Hughes said  Spurs then settled the debate for good   Jan Vertonghen fired a shot against the crossbar following a corner by Eriksen  Moments later Kane was more clinical  His second goal came courtesy of a perfectly executed half volley from the edge of the area following an outswinging corner by Eriksen  The striker raised his left leg with the grace of a ballerina and then brought it cracking down like a lion tamer s whip as he sent a fierce and impeccably controlled low shot into the net   Manchester United v Southampton  EFL Cup final   live  Read more  Kane completed his hat trick five minutes later  this time with Lady Luck joining Eriksen on assist duty  The Dane rolled a free kick to the striker  whose strike from nearly 30 yards seemed unlikely to worry Lee Grant until it deflected off Crouch and carried on past the nonplussed goalkeeper and into the net   Kane may have had a hat trick under his belt but he continued to contribute to Stoke s debagging  He embarrassed Bruno Martins Indi with a cheeky piece of skill before racing towards the box in time added on at the end of the first half  Instead of shooting from a difficult angle he presented Alli with the easy task of stroking the ball into the empty net   Stoke  seemingly dazed by Spurs  speed and movement  looked like they could do with a break  and perhaps a lie down  They attempted to restore a measure of dignity in the second half  or at least preserve the ruins of it   Preservation was the name of Pochettino s game when he withdrew Vertonghen and Toby Alderweireld in the second half amid complaints of slight strains   Spurs did not over stretch themselves for the sake of a fifth goal  especially after Kane collided with a post while attempting to convert a header  Alli tried to double his own tally in the final minute but flicked a shot just wide from six yards   Alli s overall performance was bright   and unsullied by the sort of tackle that had earned him a red card against Gent on Thursday  Pochettino had words with him after that but would not disclose them here   They will remain private but you can imagine   he said before adding with a smile   I gave him more love than normal  He was very sad and disappointed  after Thursday  but he s only 20 years old  I will always protect and support him  He s one of the best young players in the world  Sometimes he can make mistakes but I want him on the pitch    The win lifted Spurs to within 10 points of league leaders Chelsea   The target is to keep winning and be there if anything wrong happens to Chelsea   Pochettino said  If only they could play Stoke every week ",

        "body2": "Google has taken on Amazon's Alexa  Apple's Siri  and Microsoft's Cortana with its own voice assistant called Google Assistant   Google unveiled Google Assistant at its Google I O conference in May 2016  pitching the new voice assistant as an improvement of the experience in Google Now  as well as an expansion of Google's existing  OK Google  voice controls   Let's dive into how it works  which devices it is available on  and when you'll be able to use it   Google Assistant is Google's latest iteration of an assistant  It's considered an upgrade or an extension of Google Now    designed to be personal    as well as an expansion of Google's existing  OK Google  voice controls   For anyone who has been using Android for some time  you'll know that Google's Google Now feature smartly pulls out relevant information for you  It knows where you work  and it knows your meeting locations and travel plans  the sports teams you like  and what interests you  This data is presented to you in cards and through reminders on your Android device   The  OK Google  side covers voice commands  voice searching  and voice activated device control  letting you do things like send messages  check appointments and so on on your Android device  just like Apple's Siri on an iPhone or iPad  Google Assistant fuses all this together with a new bot centric AI experience  designed to give you conversational interactions that cover both these areas and more   Here's how Google explained its new assistant    The assistant is conversational    an ongoing two way dialogue between you and Google that understands your world and helps you get things done  It makes it easy to buy movie tickets while on the go  to find that perfect restaurant for your family to grab a quick bite before the movie starts  and then help you navigate to the theater    Google Assistant is now available on the Google Pixel smartphones and Google Home  A limited version can also be accessed now in the Google Allo app  It is also coming to Android Wear devices via Android Wear 2 0  and Google has confirmed it will be made available for Android TV  both televisions and set top boxes  as well as cars  presumably through Android powered infotainment systems or even Android Auto   Although Google has said that Google Assistant is exclusive to the Pixel smartphones  it has also said Google Assistant is appearing on Pixel phones first  suggesting it will be coming to other devices in the future  And since the Allo app works across almost all Android devices  as well as the iPhone  you could say that nearly all smartphones have access to Google Assistant   However  the full Google Assistant experience is deeply integrated into the Pixel devices  and it is very different to the iteration in Allo  which is limited by comparison    as we discuss below  We expect Google to have Google Assistant on all Android  Android Wear  and Android Auto devices before too long   The thing to remember about Google Assistant is that it is designed to be conversational  That means you can ask a question and then ask several follow up questions  and Google Assistant will be able to keep track of the conversation  determine context  and audibly respond with the right information  Here's how Google Assistant works across the different Google devices   With Google Assistant baked deep into the new Pixel smartphones  it's no surprise to find that there's instant access from the home button  Where this home button would once give you Now on Tap with a long press  that's now replaced by Google Assistant   Long press on the home button and you enter the Google Assistant interface  This looks a lot like OK Google and can be triggered with the same hot word  with listening bars picking up your voice and instantly transcribing what you say onto the screen  You are then delivered a spoken reply  with results returned on the screen too  You can speak or tap your selections and the conversation continues   For example  you can ask what you should have for dinner  and Google Assistant will locate local places to eat and serve up suggestions  with cards for a selection of restaurants  Google has further demonstrated this example by then booking a table using OpenTable   Google Assistant also takes over things like navigation  Say you want to navigate home    as you would with OK Google    that still works  but you can also ask to find coffee shops on the way  for example   Things run much deeper  though  You can ask what your next flight is  when your trip is  and you can ask to watch a particular programme on Netflix  or you can ask to view dog photos from your collection  There's also a wide range of fun options  like games  with a full panel show game hidden behind the  I'm feeling lucky  command   Our experience so far suggests that Google Assistant is going to be huge and as it stands  it's a long way ahead of Siri  Alexa or Cortana   Google Home is a connected speaker that also works as a smarthome control center and an assistant for the whole family  You can use it to playback entertainment throughout your entire house  effortlessly manage every day tasks  and ask Google what you want to know  Google Home is able to do much of these things thanks to Google Assistant  working in a similar way to Alexa on Amazon's Echo   The idea behind Google Home  however  is to be more integrated into your home environment  The Google Assistant is access with the OK Google hot word  or by tapping on the top of the Home device  Smarthome support comes in the form of IFTTT  Nest  Hue  SmartThings  so you'll be able to speak commands  as well as Chromecast support  meaning you can just speak to watch Netflix on your TV  which is really clever   Like Amazon's Alexa  you can ask almost anything    weights  measures  check your schedule  book an Uber  and more  Where this would all be phone centric in the past  Google Assistant makes it easier to do all of this stuff through Google Home  just by using your voice   A lot of the original Android Wear experience relied on voice control  With Android Wear 2 0  the whole platform is now better equipped to deal with alternative inputs  like the swipe keyboard  as well as voice  Google Assistant is now available to better service your commands and demands  It can hold contextual conversations to deliver the information you want  as well as take other actions   For example  you'll be able to ask Google to find an restaurant and navigate you there  In addition to a microphone  you'll also be able to hear replies through the watch's speaker  if supported by hardware   Best of all  Google Assistant works in English and German  with more languages coming soon  The LG Watch Sport and LG Watch Style are the launch devices for Android Wear 2 0  and  unfortunately  the update won't be made available for every Android Wear smartwatch  especially the older ones like the original Moto 360   The Google Assistant you get with Android Wear 2 0 is a lot like what you find in the Pixel phones and Google Home  On the LG Watch Style  you can call upon Google Assistant by holding down the exterior crown  Assistant will ask you how it can help  You can use it do a range of tasks    such as a quick conversion for foreign exchange rates  or sending a message  or tracking your run or to launch an app   And  if you're watching TV via Chromecast  you can use your Android Wear 2 0 watch a remote of sorts  Assistant will let you control any compatible smart home device    from Samsung Smart Things to Nest  What you can't do seems to be hit or miss  For instance  you can't call an Uber through Assistant on the watch like you can through Google Home  You also can't get Spotify to play a specific playlist   The full integration of Google Assistant is coming to Android TV compatible televisions and set top boxes   Pending a forthcoming software update  it will enable the new Nvidia Shield TV to be controlled almost entirely by voice  and Samsung SmartThings support will add the ability to control smart devices around the house  It will effectively turn your Shield into a Google Home or Amazon Echo  albeit one that plays media through a TV rather than speaker and has the ability to bring up on screen results   We've seen it work with a Nest thermostat  coffee maker and lighting in an early demo  so it's an excellent addition when it comes  Nvidia chose to use the game controller as the mic  however  so you do need to leave it lying around within earshot  Nvidia told us that was necessary  Putting the mic in the Shield TV box meant that it would have to be proudly displayed instead   We will update this piece with more details when the new Nvidia Shield TV and other Android TV devices get Google Assistant   Allo is Google's new smart chat app   The messenger has started its roll out on Android and iOS and is designed to give you plenty of options when it comes to chatting to your friends  Rather than just giving you a straight down the line messaging app  Allo makes chat more fun and interactive  It's based on your phone number    like WhatsApp    and seems to be going after all the popular chat apps  with emoji  stickers  and more   One of its hottest features in the app is Google Assistant  Google took the voice assistant  as well as bots like the ones found in Facebook Messenger  and rolled them all into one product  In Allo  you can to ask Google Assistant questions by either typing   google  and then asking your question or by using your voice to dictate   Google Assistant will serve up results for or responses to your questions in Allo  Again  this is all conversational  so you can ask follow up questions and the clever bot remains contextually aware  You can ask anything you'd type in to Google Search or Maps  including asking it to find you a place to eat nearby or how many euros are in a number of pounds  You can interact with it by asking it to tell you something interesting  show you something funny  or show a video about something specific  and it all shows up within the chat you're in  You don't need to leave the app   One of the cool features is the in chat game  Type   google let's play a game  and you'll get the option to play emoji based trivia games  The app also features an incognito mode so that you can make your conversations more private  and you can even set them to self destruct within a specified amount of time   The Google Pixel phones launched in the US in October 2016  with Google Assistant baked to the core   Google Home with built in  voice activated Google Assistant launched in the US in November 2016  with no word on when the speaker might be coming to the UK or other regions   Google's long awaited Android Wear 2 0 update gives you Google Assistant  Unfortunately  Android 2 0 won't be available for every Android Wear smartwatch  Older devices like the original Moto 360 and the LG G Watch aren't compatible  You can see the list of confirmed watch models here   Keep in mind LG has designed the LG Watch Sport and LG Watch Style in collaboration with Google    and these are the launch devices for Android Wear 2 0  The LG Watch Sport and Style will be available from 10 February in the US and will be coming to other regions soon after   While making an announcement at CES 2017 in January  Google confirmed Google Assistant is coming to Android TV compatible televisions and set top boxes  Your Sony Bravia TV will get an update allowing you access to Google Assistant on your TV  and Google said you can expect the update sometime in  the coming months    However  Google has confirmed that the  190 new Nvidia Shield TV  pending a forthcoming software update  will be the first to give you the full hands free Google Assistant experience  And  like Google Home  Nvidia's Shield Spot    a Wi Fi connected microphone speaker peripheral that can be placed anywhere and connect to your Shield Android TV over Wi Fi    will be one of the first devices to spread Google Assistant around your house  a little like the Amazon Echo Dot   Nvidia hasn't yet announced a launch date for Spot   Google has confirmed that Google Assistant is also going to be available in cars  Currently  this appears to be through compatible Android powered in car infotainment systems  but the company made no specific mention of Android Auto  nor did it announce a rollout date   You can now use Google Assistant in the Google Allo app   Based on the code in a new alpha release of the Google app for Android  it looks like Google Assistant is coming to older phones  The app includes code for adding the AI powered bot to any phone  according to Android Police  Some Nexus 6P users have been able to access the Google Assistant welcome screen up with a long press on the home button  but it's not happening consistently across all handsets   Still  with the onslaught of Amazon Alexa and Samsung's upcoming Bixby  it makes sense for Google to get Google Assistant on as many devices as possible    and as soon as possible ",

academy has already started attracting children from in and outside Nigeria    This is a Nigerian fountain that is going to sprout  Like they say about great oak trees  it starts from a little acorn and that's the acorn you are seeing right now   says Leslie Oghomienor  Barcelona's partner and the school's administrator    We don't just have children from Nigeria here  we have some from Spain  Taiwan  India  Greece and other Asian people    We are going to give them international exposure  We are going to Barcelona in April to play against other people so that they can see what we are doing

not about power  it's about supporting your teammates and keeping possession of the ball  From here  I think I am going to go places    The Lagos academy is an opportunity for Barcelona to tap into the abundant football talent out of Nigeria's 170 million people   Bernat Gorriz  the school's technical director  says there is a lot of potential in Nigeria    The good quality that African people have is the physical condition  they have good physical condition so if they can learn and they can understand our way of training  I am sure that we can have very good players here in Nigeria    Asked if the next Lionel Messi could come out of Nigeria  he said   I don't know if ever we will see another player like Messi but of course we are going to teach these kids how to be like Messi  ",

Imagine being a child of those times  barely aware of life even in the next town  An orphan perhaps  living in a British children's home   Now imagine being told that shortly you would board a ship for somewhere called Australia  to begin a new life in a sunlit wonderland  For good  No choice   It happened to thousands of British children in the decades immediately following World War Two  and they had little understanding of how it would shape their lives   The astonishing scandal of the British child migrants will be the first subject for which the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse will hold full public hearings  It's first because the migrants are now nearing the end of their lives   Clifford Walsh stands in the port of Fremantle near Perth in Western Australia   He is

miles north of Perth  are buildings Walsh and his fellow child migrants were forced to build  barefoot  starting work the day after they arrived   The Christian Brothers ruled the place with the aim of upholding order and a moral code  Within two days of arriving he says he received his first punishment at the hands of one of the brothers    He punched us  he kicked us  smashed us in the face  back handed us and everything  and he then sat us on his knee to tell us that he doesn't like to hurt children  but we had been bad boys    I was sobbing uncontrollably for hours    His story is deeply distressing  He tells it with a particularly Australian directness  He is furious   Image copyright Getty Images Image caption A teacher reads to a group of children in Stevenage who are about to be sent to the Fairbridge school in Molong  He describes one brother luring him into his room with the promise he could have some sweet molasses   normally fed  not to the boys  but the cows  The man sexually abused him   He claims another brother raped him  and and a third beat him mercilessly after falsely accusing him of having sex with another boy    We had no parents  we had no relatives  there was nowhere we could go  these brothers   these paedophiles   must have thought they were in hog heaven    He has accused the brothers at the Australian Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse  the first time he has fully disclosed his experiences   At the time he says   I was too terrified to report the abuse  I knew no other life    I've lived 60 odd years

memories    I couldn't show any affection  Stuff like that only reminded me of what the brothers would do all the time    Britain is perhaps the only country in the world to have exported vast numbers of its children  An estimated 150 000 children were sent over a 350 year period to Virginia  Australia  New Zealand  Canada  and what was then Southern Rhodesia  now Zimbabwe   Australia was the main destination in the final wave between 1945 and 1974   There were twin purposes   to ease the population of orphanages in the UK and to boost the population of the colonies   The children were recruited by religious institutions from both the Anglican and Catholic churches  or well meaning charities including Barnardo's and the Fairbridge Society  Their motivation was to give  lost  children a new life  and it would be wrong to say that every one of Britain's exported children suffered   But for too many  the dream became a nightmare  Hundreds of migrant children have given accounts of poor education  hard labour  physical beatings and sexual abuse   Image copyright Getty Images Image caption A demonstration of boxing at the Fairbridge school in Pinjarra  Western Australia  Attempts were made to recreate a happy home life  At the Fairbridge Farm School in Molong  four hours outside Sydney  children lived in cottages  each with a  house mother    Fairbridge was

children to have endured poor food  inadequate education and physical labour  His life has been deeply affected by his Fairbridge upbringing   He suffered at the hands of the then principal of the

back in the UK   In 2009 the Australian government apologised for the cruelty shown to the child migrants  Britain also made an apology in 2010   The pressure for answers and reparations had been growing  Questions might never have been asked  had it not been for two seekers of the truth   In the early 1980s a Nottingham social worker  Margaret Humphreys  came across Australian former migrants who had suddenly started to realise they might have living relatives in the UK   Many had been told  as children  their parents were dead  It wasn't true   It was about identity   she says   being stripped of it and being robbed of it    Her life's work has been about reuniting  lost children  with their lost relatives  Having reinstated their sense of identity  she went on to build a lifelong bond with many former migrants  and they began to disclose the physical and sexual abuse they had suffered    As you go along  you're learning more and more about the degrees and the awfulness of the abuse  That's been incremental because people can really only talk about it over a longer period of time when there is trust  There's a lot of trauma involved here    Image caption David Hill sailed out of Tilbury bound for a Fairbridge farm school  Further revelations about the Fairbridge homes were uncovered by one of their own   David Hill was shipped out from Britain with his brothers to the

chairman and managing director of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation  and is a keen historian  Hill brought together the Fairbridge boys and girls to tell him their stories  Like those from the west of Australia   they were dominated by beatings and abuse   Derek Moriarty was among those who unburdened themselves for the first time to Hill  as part of the research for his 2007 book The Forgotten Children and a 2009 ABC television documentary    I felt a weight lifted off my shoulders when I told him   Moriarty says   But my abuse paled into insignificance compared to some others    David Hill's work triggered claim after claim from men and women about their experiences as children   Image copyright Other Image caption Children gather at the Fairbridge school at Molong  They wrote and told him of a litany of sexual abuse  There was no sexual education at the school and  failing to understand what was happening  they were left traumatised   Hill makes the astonishing claim

behalf of 215 former Fairbridge children  of whom 129 said they had been sexually abused   For the Christian Brothers the figures are even higher  The Australian Royal Commission on child abuse recently revealed 853 people had accused members of the order   Hill is one of the expert witnesses who will give evidence to the UK Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse  IICSA   The inquiry has been bitterly criticised since its creation   and some have questioned its huge scope   Is there any point in it considering the history of child migration  dating back so far   Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Children at Pinjarra hear a speech by the Duke of Gloucester  The Australian Royal commission is examining child migration closely  In 1998 the UK's Health Select Committee also held hearings  in which the Child Migrants Trust described the Christian Brothers institutions as  almost the full realisation of a paedophile's dream    But the committee did not get to the bottom of it  concluding   The Christian Brothers were very insistent that the abuses were not known to those who controlled these institutions  We cannot accept this    Sources close to the current public inquiry have told the BBC it will produce new and startling revelations about the scale of sexual abuse abroad  and attempts by British and Australian institutions to cover it up   This will include an examination of the claims of some child migrants that they were sent abroad weeks after reporting sexual abuse at their children's home in the UK  The allegation is that they were hand picked  Either to get them out of the way  or because they were of interest to paedophiles   Three former Fairbridge boys have claimed that the then Australian Governor General  Lord Slim  sexually molested them during rides in his chauffeur driven Rolls Royce while visiting the home  It is understood these allegations could be considered by the inquiry   The inquiry could also definitively answer a crucial historical question  Did the British government know it was sending children to be mistreated in a foreign country   Margaret Humphreys is adamant   We want to know what happened  we want to know who did it  and we want to know who covered it up for so long    In fact  government files reveal that there was a time when the migration programme could have been stopped  It came in 1956 when three officials went to Australia to inspect 26 institutions which took child migrants   Image copyright National Archives  There was enough warning of this  fact finding mission  to allow a Fairbridge official to warn the manager of the Molong farm   It would be advisable to see  the children  wore their socks and shoes   Even in a land where it was easy to encounter poisonous wildlife  that wasn't standard practice at many of the institutions   The resulting report  delivered back to the British government  was fairly critical  It identified a general lack of expertise in child care and worried that children were living in institutions in remote rural areas  whereas the trend in Britain was towards fostering them into urban families   However the report had a second  secret  section  never published  which went a little further   This named names   including those of five institutions which were not up to standard  When the UK's Home Office saw the report  it wanted five more added to create what became an infamous blacklist   places which should not receive more children because of poor standards of care  Fairbridge Molong and Bindoon were both on the list   St Joseph's orphanage  Sydney  Dhurringile Rural Training Farm  Victoria  St Joseph's  Neerkol  nr Rockhampton  Queensland  Salvation Army Training Farm  Riverview  Queensland  Methodist Home  Magill  Adelaide  St Vincent's Orphanage  Castledare  St Joseph's Farm School  Bindoon  Western Australia  St John Bosco Boys' Town  Glenorchy  Hobart  Fairbridge Farm School  Pinjarra  Western Australia  Fairbridge Farm School  Molong  New South Wales  But the report had barely scratched the surface  It made no mention of sexual or physical abuse   Given the length of time it took for the child migrants to tell their stories  this is perhaps unsurprising   But during the post war years  sexual accusations were made against three principals of the Fairbridge Farm School at Molong   David Hill has revealed they included a claim that Frederick Woods   the man who beat boys with a hockey stick   was  sexually perverted  and had abused a girl resident  An internal investigation exonerated him   This does not appear to have been disclosed by the Fairbridge Society either to the public or the 1956 inspectors  They had a schedule to keep to  and their visits to institutions spread across a vast country were fleeting   Image copyright EPA Image caption Like the UK  there has been outrage in Australia over historical child abuse  Similarly  at the Christian Brothers' homes in Western Australia  children were terrified of criticising the brothers   Former Bindoon resident Clifford Walsh was there during the fact finding mission  He doesn't remember it  but says speaking out would have resulted in an extremely severe  possibly even life threatening  beating   The truth is that neither the institutions  nor the inspectors  came close to creating the sort of atmosphere where children could tell them their darkest secrets and be taken seriously  If that had happened  not just in Australia  but throughout modern British history  we might not have needed the current public inquiry   It might have missed the crimes being committed in the institutions  but when the 1956 report hit the desks of Britain's bureaucrats it created quite a stir   Something strongly resembling a cover up began  Files held at the National Archive set out the response of government officials  One wrote in 1957 that the Overseas Migration Board  which advised the government  was  sorry the mission was sent at all    Image copyright PA Image caption After a series of changes at the top  Alexis Jay is now the head of the British inquiry  Some on the board  urged very strongly that the report should not be published    The government archives record that at a meeting with the organisations running the migrant programmes  Lord John Hope  under secretary of state for Commonwealth relations  discussed what would be disclosed to parliament from the report    I think you can rely upon us to do what we can in as much as we shall pick out all the good bits   he said   I shall not be in the least critical in Parliament    The UK Fairbridge Society piled on its own pressure   its president was the Duke of Gloucester  uncle to the Queen  Officials discussed the  immediate parliamentary repercussions  which could result from holding up the migrant programme   Sir Colin Anderson  the director of the Orient Line  which benefited from the business of shipping the children  appealed for the report not to be made public because of the controversy it might cause   The Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse  The inquiry into historical child sex abuse in England and Wales is to examine claims made against local authorities  religious organisations  the armed forces and public and private institutions  Momentum for the inquiry started with the Jimmy Savile scandal  The inquiry is expected to take about five years to complete  The first phase of the inquiry will consist of 13 separate investigations  The child sexual abuse inquiry so far  In a sympathetic phone call  a senior official from the Overseas Migration Board responded that the Fairbridge Society was an  extremely fine endeavour for which everyone felt the highest praise    And what did the government do  Files at the National Archive show officials squirmed in institutional discomfort at the idea of taking any meaningful action   In June 1957 the Commonwealth Relations Office sent a secret telegram to the UK High Commission in Australia    we do not want to withhold approval   it said  for more children to to be sent from the UK   After more pressure from the Fairbridge Society  16 children waiting to travel were sent on their way   The key recommendation of the inspectors  that the British home secretary agree each and every decision to send a child  was quietly shelved   The Fairbridge Society continued to ship out children  though concentrated on those whose mothers intended to join them later   David Hill's response is anger  even today  With tears in his eyes he says   I'm surprised how vulnerable it has made me feel   that it could happen and happen to the extent that it did    The British government not only continued to approve children to be sent  but they financially subsidised for them to go  To institutions they had put on a blacklist unfit for children  condemned    Molong Farm School finally closed in 1973  The Fairbridge Society is now part of the Prince's Trust and still runs activity holidays for children   Image copyright Clifford Walsh  The Prince's Trust said it had never been involved in child migration   but we do hold the archive of the former Fairbridge Society  We are cooperating fully with this important inquiry    Bindoon remained open until 1966  It is now used as a Catholic college   The Australian Royal Commission recently estimated that 7  of the country's Catholic priests were involved in child abuse   And such is the scope of sexual abuse allegations in the Catholic and Anglican churches in the UK that entire strands of the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse are dedicated to them   The IICSA investigation will be able to seize the records  not just of the British government but also the migration institutions themselves   including the archives of the Fairbridge society   Sixty years later  former Bindoon boy Clifford Walsh strongly believes this inquiry can help answer some of his questions about the culpability of the government and British institutions    They sent us to a place that was a living hell  How come they didn't know that  Why didn't they investigate  And if they investigated  then they were incompetent or there was a cover up    The child migration programme will also provide ample evidence for the UK's effort to consider the long term effect of child sexual abuse  Something which may turn out to be a central theme of the inquiry   Historian and Fairbridge boy David Hill estimates it took victims he interviewed 22 years on average before they felt able to disclose what happened   But it will also provide a final chance for Britain's lost children to return to the land of their birth and tell their stories  The anger has not gone away  and their childhoods have left invisible scars which have lasted a lifetime   One of the child migrants we spoke to asked us not to name him  after he returned to Bindoon armed with a sledgehammer   His target  The ostentatious burial place of Brother Paul Keaney the institution's founder  By the time he'd finished  enough damage had been done to the marble grave slab that Bindoon's current owners  a Catholic college  were forced to remove what remained   It was one man's small blow against a history of child cruelty   Have you been affected by abuse ",
