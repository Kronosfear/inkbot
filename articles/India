(LIVE SCORECARD)\n\nThe burly pacer, who took four wickets for 47, became the fifth Bangladesh cricketer to pick a hattrick in ODI cricket. Shahadat Hossain, Abdur Razzak, Rubel Hossain and Taijul Islam have taken hattricks for the Bangla Tigers.\n\nTaskin Ahmed\u2019s torrid spell knocked out the Sri Lankan tail after Kusal Mendis slammed his maiden ODI century as the hosts won the toss and decided to bat.\n\nTaskin Ahmed knocked out Asela Gunaratne, Suranga Lakmal and Nuwan Pradeep of successive deliveries to stop a torrent of runs from the Sri Lankan batsmen. Gunaratne was particularly aggressive with a 28-ball 39.\n\nThe 21-year old Taskin Ahmed\u2019s hat trick was also the 41st in 3856 ODIs.\n\nLasith Malinga has three hat tricks while Pakistan\u2019s Wasim Akram and Saqlain Mushtaq and Sri Lanka\u2019s Chaminda Vaas are the three bowlers with multiple hattricks to their names.\n\nPakistan\u2019s Jalaluddin, Aaqib Javed, Waqar Younis and Mohammed Sami, Australian Bruce Reid, Anthony Stuart, Brett Lee, Daniel Christian and Clint MCkay and James Faulkner, India\u2019s Chetan Sharma and Kapil Dev, England\u2019s James Anderson, Steve Harmison, Steven Finn and Andrew Flintoff, New Zealand\u2019s Danny Morrison and Shane Bond, Zimbabwean Eddo Brandes and Prosper Utseya, South African Charl Langeveldt, Jean-Paul Duminy and Kagiso Rabada, West Indian Jerome Taylor and Kemar Roach and Sri Lankan Farveez Maharoof and Thisara Perera are the other bowlers with one hattrick in ODIs.\n\nSri Lanka captain Upul Tharanga, playing his 200th ODI, won the toss and elected to bat. Bangladesh, who are seeking victory in the three-match series after winning Saturday\u2019s opener by 90 runs, fielded an unchanged squad.\n\nSri Lanka made three changes, bringing in Nuwan Kulasekara, Nuwan Pradeep and Dilruwan Perera for Sachith Pathiranam, Lahiru Kumara and Lakshan Sandakan.\n\nThe tourists lead 1-0 going into Tuesday\u2019s contest at Dambulla and know that victory would secure their third ever series win away from Bangladeshi soil.\n\nBangladesh dominated Sri Lanka with bat and ball during the opening game Saturday of the three-match series to clinch a crushing 90-run win against their more illustrious opponents.\n\nA win on Tuesday would see them take an unassailable 2-0 lead in the series.\n\n(With inputs from S Pervez Qaiser)",
