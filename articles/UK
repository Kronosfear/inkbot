        "body1": "London  Harry Kane hit a first half hat trick as Tottenham stormed up to second in the Premier League with a 4 0 home demolition of Stoke on Sunday  Kane's treble took his tally to 17 league goals this season  while his first of the day at White Hart Lane was his 100th club goal   The England forward  23  who also scored three against Fulham in the FA Cup a week ago  capped an outstanding all round display by setting up Dele Alli for the fourth  That helped Alli to draw a line under his dismissal against Gent that contributed to Spurs' Europa League exit on Thursday   Tottenham's victory took them above Manchester City and closed the gap on runaway leaders Chelsea to 10 points  The damaging failure to beat Gent marked the latest disappointment for Spurs in a frustrating month that also saw their title challenge fade significantly   The challenge confronting Mauricio Pochettino's side was to produce a performance and result that would help put the midweek embarrassment behind them  It quickly became clear this game would provide the ideal platform for Spurs and Alli to redeem themselves after a testing 72 hours of soul searching   Within three minutes  Christian Eriksen had flashed a shot across the face of goal  provoking an angry reaction from Pochettino  who was infuriated at the Dane's failure to pick out a better placed teammate  The manager need not have worried  Stoke could barely manage to rouse themselves and after Joe Allen hit the side netting for the visitors  Kane produced the 14th minute opening goal that put the home side firmly in control   The chance came when Stoke's Ryan Shawcross failed to clear Eriksen s threaded pass  but Kane s finish was ruthless  with the striker latching onto the loose ball and producing a first time shot that flew across keeper Lee Grant  The technique Kane demonstrated in claiming his second in the 32nd minute was even better   Eriksen's right wing corner was played out to Kane  who had positioned himself on the edge of the area  where he hit the bouncing ball on the full  left footed  inside Grant's right hand post   Prior to that  Stoke threatened when Peter Crouch slid in to meet Erik Pieters' low cross  only to be denied by the boot of Spurs Keeper Hugo Lloris  while Charlie Adam collected a booking for a foul on Alli  But their response quickly faded and Tottenham's third came when Adam again fouled Alli to concede a free kick 30 yards out   Eriksen rolled the ball to Kane  whose low shot deflected off the defensive wall  wrong footing Grant and securing the striker's hat trick   Stoke boss Mark Hughes was clearly angered by his side's display but worse was to come in first half stoppage time when Kane out paced Bruno Martins Indi on the right and burst into the box before squaring for Alli  who slid in for the fourth   Injury to Toby Alderweireld at the start of the second half provided Spurs' first setback of the game  while the sight of Kane colliding with a post was also a momentary cause for concern   That aside  the only frustration for Spurs and Kane was that they failed to add to their first half tally  with Grant producing an excellent save to deny the striker his fourth goal ", 
        "body0": "Lads  it s Stoke City  After the embarrassing exit from the Europa League on Thursday  Tottenham Hotspur eased back into Premier League action by thrashing their most submissive opponents  Mauricio Pochettino s team had beaten Stoke 4 0 in their two previous meetings and it took only one half for them to reach that score here  as Harry Kane struck three goals before inviting Dele Alli to hit another  If Wembley spooks Spurs  the sight of Stoke City jerseys cheers them right up   Spurs  in fairness  have clobbered most opponents at White Hart Lane this season  their tally for the Premier League campaign now standing at 11 wins and two draws from 13 matches  But few visitors have been as obliging as Stoke  who  seemingly unrefreshed by a break in Dubai began as if expecting another trouncing  That was a self fulfilling attitude that made them ideal opponents for a Spurs team eager to reassert their top team credentials after flopping out of Europe at Wembley   Tottenham Hotspur v Stoke City  Premier League   as it happened Read more   We never really got out of the traps   admitted Mark Hughes   We talked about having a bright start but that didn t materialise for us  Unfortunately we were a little bit too passive  At times we were just a little bit awestruck and had a little bit too much respect for them  Maybe some of the players had scars from the previous performances  against Spurs  but they shouldn t have because we have been in good form recently    The first sign of Stoke docility came in only the fourth minute  when Christian Eriksen nutmegged Ryan Shawcross in the box and rolled the ball across the face of goal  Fortunately for Stoke there was no Tottenham player there to complete a tap in but it was not long before Spurs players were infiltrating the area in swarms  Shawcross  for years the most formidable of sentinels for Stoke  was particularly discombobulated and Spurs  opening goal was a result of his confusion  As the defender tried to tidy up following another incursion by Eriksen in the 14th minute  Kane nicked the ball off him and lashed in a low shot from 15 yards   Stoke attempted to stammer a retort and  in fairness  presented a cogent argument in the 24th minute in the form of a flowing move down the left involving Ramadan Sobhi and Erik Pieters  Peter Crouch nearly topped that off with a telling finish from four yards but Hugo Lloris had the last word with a superb save   If that had gone in it might have stirred us from our slumbers   Hughes said  Spurs then settled the debate for good   Jan Vertonghen fired a shot against the crossbar following a corner by Eriksen  Moments later Kane was more clinical  His second goal came courtesy of a perfectly executed half volley from the edge of the area following an outswinging corner by Eriksen  The striker raised his left leg with the grace of a ballerina and then brought it cracking down like a lion tamer s whip as he sent a fierce and impeccably controlled low shot into the net   Manchester United v Southampton  EFL Cup final   live  Read more  Kane completed his hat trick five minutes later  this time with Lady Luck joining Eriksen on assist duty  The Dane rolled a free kick to the striker  whose strike from nearly 30 yards seemed unlikely to worry Lee Grant until it deflected off Crouch and carried on past the nonplussed goalkeeper and into the net   Kane may have had a hat trick under his belt but he continued to contribute to Stoke s debagging  He embarrassed Bruno Martins Indi with a cheeky piece of skill before racing towards the box in time added on at the end of the first half  Instead of shooting from a difficult angle he presented Alli with the easy task of stroking the ball into the empty net   Stoke  seemingly dazed by Spurs  speed and movement  looked like they could do with a break  and perhaps a lie down  They attempted to restore a measure of dignity in the second half  or at least preserve the ruins of it   Preservation was the name of Pochettino s game when he withdrew Vertonghen and Toby Alderweireld in the second half amid complaints of slight strains   Spurs did not over stretch themselves for the sake of a fifth goal  especially after Kane collided with a post while attempting to convert a header  Alli tried to double his own tally in the final minute but flicked a shot just wide from six yards   Alli s overall performance was bright   and unsullied by the sort of tackle that had earned him a red card against Gent on Thursday  Pochettino had words with him after that but would not disclose them here   They will remain private but you can imagine   he said before adding with a smile   I gave him more love than normal  He was very sad and disappointed  after Thursday  but he s only 20 years old  I will always protect and support him  He s one of the best young players in the world  Sometimes he can make mistakes but I want him on the pitch    The win lifted Spurs to within 10 points of league leaders Chelsea   The target is to keep winning and be there if anything wrong happens to Chelsea   Pochettino said  If only they could play Stoke every week ",

        "body2": "Toilet woes at Clifden Bridge freedom camping ground  Toilet numbers  On Saturday night  there were nine tents in the Clifden Bridge freedom campground and 15 vehicles  none of them self contained   This is not unusual this time of year   The single toilet was overflowing and the smell horrific   This is not the first time this summer overflow has happened  indeed it has happened more than once every summer for the past few years   Clearly  the tank size is inadequate and it is not pumped out as frequently as necessary   In addition to the campers  there is a constant stream of visitors to the bridge all day at this time of year  many of them overseas visitors and the toilet is not cleaned every day   When the toilet tank overflows  the waste goes into a ditch  which drains a few meters into the Waiau River   And when the toilet is unusable  the campers use the surrounding area as a toilet  Sometimes in my place nearby   I have contacted the Southland District Council on several occasions alerting them to the overflowing tank  but the problem re occurs  and the council seems to find the situation acceptable   I would like to ask the council if it had a requirement of toilet numbers for commercial camping grounds  and if so  why they consider the regulations should not apply to freedom camping grounds   John Moffatt  Clifden  Reply  The council is aware that the Clifden Bridge freedom camping site is very popular and usage of the campsite and toilet facilities has grown rapidly in recent times   This has meant the single toilet there has extensive use and so needs to be maintained very often   It is monitored by council's contractors  council staff and local operators but sometimes we still get caught out by how quickly it fills   When we are informed it is full  we call our contractors straightaway to deal with it   The council is planning to replace this toilet in next year's Long Term Plan  and this will include assessment of the number of pans needed and other aspects of the design   We also plan to make an application to the Government's tourism infrastructure funding to help fund this upgrade   The fund is targeted to respond to increasing infrastructure demands caused by increasing tourism numbers and this is exactly what is happening at Clifden   There are regulations for registered camping grounds on the number of toilets   Ian Marshall  Services and Assets group manager   Southland District Council  Excellent performances  What a great event this year's Buskers Festival was  and even the weather was good for the majority of the time  despite the dire predictions of the TV weather presenters   The different acts were just that   different  as opposed to some years when there has been a preponderance of  say  juggling or acrobats   Not only that  but many  most   were new to me  and to Invercargill    which mixed things up even more   It was great fun and I thoroughly enjoyed this year's festival  so well done to Angela Newell and the team that put it on   Also  hearty congratulations and sincere thanks to the performers who gave us such excellent shows   and one that everybody could afford   I also managed to catch part of the Fiona Pears and Band concert in Queens Park  another excellent performance  and  again  just that little bit different   David North  Riverton  Child poverty  The Salvation Army has reported that 20 28 per cent of New Zealand children live in poverty   In real terms  nearly one family in seven has to make significant cut backs in order to make ends meet   As the editorial in The Southland Times on the same day  9 2 17  notes  there's no reason to doubt the Salvation Army's figures   I don't doubt them either  as I used them often in my own research  which also found that hundreds of Southland children were being admitted to hospital every year with infectious and respiratory diseases  conditions made worse by cold  damp housing   The same research also found that many of these hospital admissions could potentially have been prevented with early access to a GP  although given childhood illnesses don't keep office hours  after hours access is crucial  It's thus concerning that a recent survey by Clare Curran found that many Invercargill families viewed the cost of after hours GP services as prohibitive   The Salvation Army summed up the situation by saying  Of greatest disappointment is the persistence of child poverty    the culpability of Government in this lack of progress should be noted  especially through its welfare reforms  which have yet to identify any positive impacts on the lives of poorer New Zealand children    My own conclusion  having had to watch the consequences of the Government's inaction play out in children's lives  year after year reporting the same high child poverty rates  the thousands of children admitted to hospital for poverty related conditions  is that we have to change the Government  Anything less will see the same suffering entrenched for another generation   Dr Liz Craig   Labour Party candidate for Invercargill     Stuff",

        "body2": "Missed out on the news this week and need to catch up  You've come to the right place  as we take a look at all the big headlines from the week that's gone by  MWC 2017 action has already kicked off and there's quite a lot to look forward to  but there were some pretty interesting developments this week as well  Here's what you need to know   Reliance Jio finally rolled out a paid plan   a new subscription plan called Reliance Jio Prime  which will start from April 1  Until then  you're still covered by the Reliance Jio Happy New Year offer free services  The Jio Reliance Prime subscription will set you back by a one time cost of Rs  99  followed by a monthly fee of Rs  303  for unlimited usage for 12 months  It's an interesting offer  but some analysts say it is a misstep as the offer is not sustainable  On the other hand  Reliance Jio rivals seem relieved that Jio has finally started charging for its services   With Reliance Jio Prime  you will get unlimited mobile data for a year  1GB daily FUP limit   plus the media and content benefits associated with the Jio apps suite  Reliance Industries Chairman Mukesh Ambani pegged the value of the Jio Prime plan at Rs  10 000  A Reliance Jio statement said   There will be many other attractive deals and offers from both Jio and its partners  for  the Jio Prime members    Aside from the Reliance Jio Prime announcement  we also got a number of high profile leaks just ahead of MWC  The new Nokia flagship  the Nokia 8 or Nokia P1 saw some information being leaked thanks to an e commerce listing  The alleged Nokia 8 carries a price tag of CNY 3 188  roughly Rs  31 000  in the JD com listing  Unfortunately  it's hard to confirm the authenticity of the online listing of the Nokia 8  We also got to know a bit more about the Nokia 3310 reboot  promising that the phone will not stray too far from the original  though with a slightly larger  colour display  and is likely to be priced at EUR 59   On the specifications front  the rumoured Nokia 8 is rumoured to be powered by Qualcomm's latest Snapdragon 835 processor  and sport a 5 7 inch QHD Super AMOLED display  The Nokia 8 is further likely to

come with expandable storage support via microSD card slot  up to 256GB   Nokia 8 is said to run Android 7 0 Nougat   We also got a fresh leak about the Motorola Moto G5   new photos show a metal body  and hint at a removable battery  The Moto G5 and its bigger sibling the Motorola Moto G5 Plus will both are expected to be launched on Sunday and an earlier report has already claimed that the Moto G5 may be priced lower than its predecessor was  at launch   The Moto G5 and Moto G5 Plus are rumoured come with similar specifications including full HD screen resolution  Corning Gorilla Glass 3 cover for protection  run on Android 7 0 Nougat out of the box  and support expandable storage via microSD card  up to 128GB   Some of the other similarities in the Moto G5 and Moto G5 Plus include fingerprint scanner at the front  2GB of RAM  5 megapixel front camera  and water repellent coating  Both Moto G5 and G5 Plus are expected to come in Lunar Grey and Fine Gold colours   Meanwhile WhatsApp followed Instagram in taking a leaf out of Snapchat's playbook   it's debuted a new Status feature that looks and works a lot like Snapchat stories  allowing you to post photos and videos that disappear in 24 hours  WhatsApp Status revamp was announced earlier this week  and rolled out globally on Friday  As of now  the old text WhatsApp status messages are gone  though a new leak suggests they'll be back soon  and called 'taglines'   How to Create  Edit  Delete WhatsApp Status Update  And in case you've given up on this planet  NASA made a startling announcement that you might

recently spotted shooting at a studio in Mumbai for Smartron  which is working on its next device under the project name  Rimo SRT    Ahead of MWC  Qualcomm announced a new virtual reality development

two phones in India  the HTC U Ultra and HTC U Play  The two phones are priced at Rs  59 990 and Rs  39 990 respectively  and both have the Sense Companion feature  an AI based system that learns the

announced the Asus ZenFone Live  a 5 inch Android Marshmallow device powered by a quad core processor  Its standout feature is the company's new BeautyLive app  which is a live streaming

The laptop arrived in India in May 2015 with a price tag of Rs  1 59 990   There were also a few interesting security related stories this week  A collaboration between Google's research unit and a Dutch institute on Thursday cracked a widely used cryptographic technology that has been one of the key building blocks of Internet security  The algorithm  known as Secure Hash Algorithm 1 or SHA 1  is currently used to verify the integrity of digital files and signatures that secure credit card transactions as well as Git open source software repositories  There was also an unexpected sign out from many Google accounts   Google says it is continuing to investigate the matter  but it clarified that there is no indication that the issue is connected to phishing or account security threats  There's also new malware targeting Chrome users on Mac and Windows both  which prompts you to install a 'missing' font in a bid to gain access to your computer  Finally  Cloudflare admitted to a data leak that could have leaked data from millions of websites and apps  including Uber  1Password  and Fitbit  The Cloudflare CTO in a blog post said the problem had been fixed quickly  and that there was no sign yet the leak had been exploited by hackers   Meanwhile  after last week's strike of Uber and Ola drivers in Delhi NCR  things eased up in the Capital  and the strike was called off after some demands were met  According to the drivers on strike  these included not having to pay a fine for refusing to ferry a customer  and increasing the fees charged  On Thursday  drivers in Bengaluru called for an indefinite strike  though the ones we've spoken to are talking about getting back on the roads by Monday  The drivers are demanding that the companies offer better incentives  and stop adding new cabs to the fleets   These were the biggest headlines this week   but if there was something that caught your eye in the week that's gone by  let us and the other readers know  via the
