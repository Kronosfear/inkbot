However, things took an unexpected turn before the night was over when, despite both of them vowing they weren't interested in each other, Ben and Johnny ended up in bed together!\n\nThe episode began with a rather delightful wake-up call from Jay, who came into Ben's room brandishing a cardboard cut-out of a \u201csexy fireman\u201d.\n\nAn unimpressed Ben wasn\u2019t getting into the spirit of things. He said he wanted a quiet night at The Vic but Jay had already invited people (seemingly everyone he'd ever met and their dog) to a house party at their place later.\n\nMissing his late boyfriend Paul and his dad Phil, Ben spent the day doing the rounds of family in Albert Square. Ian put his foot in it when he said \u201cyou should be with your loved ones on special occasions\u201d. Thanks for rubbing that in, Ian.\n\nJohnny, meanwhile, told his dad at the beginning of the episode that he could really do with a drink and a night off. At the party, he mentioned to Ben that \u201cstudying law is as hard as it sounds\u201d and let him top up his drink.\n\nAfter Billy delivered a message and a gift from Phil, Ben conceded that his birthday had turned out alright in the end.\n\nHe warned Johnny that Jay was probably going to try and set them up at some point during the evening, explaining: \u201cWe\u2019re the only gay blokes in the room. He\u2019ll put two and two together and get five... Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll leave you alone I promise\u201d.\n\nAs the night wore on, though, Abi noticed that Johnny had been eyeing Ben up all night. They both repeatedly denied that they fancied each other but they weren't convincing anyone, let alone themselves.\n\nAt the end of the night, Abi and Tom stumbled into Ben\u2019s bedroom only to leave immediately when he forgot her name and killed the mood. Unbeknownst to them, the bed was already occupied.\n\nAs the camera panned over the crumpled duvet, Ben popped his head up from under the covers. Then he pulled back the sheets to reveal Johnny in bed next to him and the pair kissed!\n\nIs this just a birthday one-off or could it be the start of a beautiful romance?\n\nYou can watch a 60-second rundown of next week's episodes of EastEnders below.\n\nAnd visit our dedicated EastEnders page for all the latest news, interviews and spoilers.",

Still grieving for the loss of boyfriend Paul last summer, the memories come flooding back for the Mitchell mechanic as he wishes his deceased soul mate was by his side for his milestone birthday.\n\nBut Jay comes to the rescue and persuades a reluctant Ben to break out the bunting, and on Tuesday he throws his bruv a party in their new house.\n\nAs the party gets into full swing - with a mystery surprise guest spicing up the proceedings - stirring Abi Branning teases Johnny that he's got a crush on Ben. Shy Johnny denies it, which obviously means he's got the hots for the moody Mitchell. These two have flirted before, and in the aftermath of Paul's death drunk and confused Ben tried to kiss the stunned Mr Carter.\n\nHowever, despite protests from both boys that they absolutely do not fancy each other, Ben and Johnny get chatting over a drink or three and the spark is evident.

And so I suppose that means he drinks too much, smokes too much and in general his music and hobbies are close to mine.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a sensitive sort of fellow though, a bit vulnerable.\u201d\n\nIn 1987 the sleuth shot to worldwide attention when ITV screened the first of 33 episodes of the TV drama. Morse lived on following the end of the series, and actor John Thaw\u2019s death, through sequel Lewis and prequel Endeavour.\n\nMaria Rejt, Colin's most recent editor at Macmillan, said: \"Colin was an author who inspired all those who worked with him.\n\n\"His loyalty, modesty and self-deprecating humour gave joy to many. His was the sharpest mind and the biggest heart, and his wonderful novels and stories will remain a testament to both.\u201d\n\nJeremy Trevathan, Macmillan's publisher, added: \"With Colin's death there has been a tectonic shift in the International crime writing scene.\n\n\"Colin represented the absolute epitome of British crime writing, and in the 1990s John Thaw's Inspector Morse took over Wednesday night television.\n\n\"He was one of those television characters who the nation took to their hearts.\n\n\"This is a very sad day for us all.\"\n\nIn the manner of Alfred Hitchcock he made a cameo in almost all of the episodes - a role he continued until the most recent series of Endeavour.\n\nLaurence Fox, who plays DI James Hathaway in Lewis, tweeted a picture of the cast with Mr Dexter.\n\nWhat a grin. #dexter pic.twitter.com/nPOgfDWLNV \u2014 Laurence Fox (@LozzaFox) 21 March 2017\n\nMr Fox tweeted: \"Farewell wonderful Colin.\n\n\"Thank you for your rich characters, your mischief and for being the best dinner companion anyone could wish for.\"\n\nRoger Allam, who plays Morse's mentor DI Fred Thursday in Endeavour, also paid tribute.\n\nVery sorry to hear of the passing of the great Colin Dexter.

Other honours include the CWA Cartier Diamond Dagger for outstanding crime fiction which he was awarded in 1997, following winning The Golden Dagger Award for crime fiction in 1989.\n\nColin Dexter receives his OBE.\n\nDexter was born in Stamford, in Lincolnshire and was educated at Stamford School before completing his national service with the Royal Corps of Signals ahead of reading classics at Christ\u2019s College, Cambridge.\n\nHe was given the Freedom of Oxford in 2001, joining a group including the late Nelson Mandela and Burmese human rights campaigner Aung San Suu Kyi.\n\nSpeaking as the honour was announced he joked: \u201cI hope I don\u2019t end up in jail like the other two.\n\n\u201cI just feel very proud, honoured and delighted but I\u2019m not an Oxford man.\n\n\u201cI consider myself very fortunate to live in a place like Oxford, but to come here and be accepted and rewarded like this is huge.\u201d\n\nKevin Lygo, director of television at ITV, said: \"We're very sad to hear this news and our deepest sympathies go to Colin Dexter's family.\n\n\"When Colin's celebrated novels were adapted for television they went on to become one of the nation's best-loved shows.\n\n\"Colin was closely involved in the production of Inspector Morse, advising on scripts and making keenly anticipated cameo appearances in many of the films.\n\n\"Colin also worked closely with ITV as a consultant on Lewis, the highly successful sequel to Inspector Morse which starred Kevin Whately and ran for nine years.\n\n\"He was also one of the key creative forces behind Endeavour, the acclaimed prequel series starring Shaun Evans as the young Morse.\n\n\"ITV is very grateful to Colin for bringing so much joy to the audience over the years and the world of Inspector E Morse will live forever.\"\n\nCrime writers\n\nCrime writers Ian Rankin and Val McDermid were among Dexter's literary contemporaries paying tribute following his death.\n\nRankin wrote on Twitter: \"Sad news - a gentle man with a steel mind; and the creator of such an iconic character.\"\n\nMcDermid said she was \"deeply sorry to hear of the death of my good friend Colin Dexter\".\n\nShe added: \"He brought pleasure to millions and joy to his friends.\"\n\nDexter\u2019s love for crosswords included composing the puzzles regularly for The Oxford Times under the name Codex.\n\nIn 1978, as a new series launched in the paper, he wrote of his love for cryptic clues, saying: \u201cThere can be little real satisfaction in finally solving an obscure clue which finally leads to a dialectical word, now obsolete, in Lowland Scots.\n\n\u201cBut how different when the word was perfectly well known to us all the time, when minimal demands have been made on our general vocabulary or general knowledge \u2013 but where we have been delightfully misled.\u201d\n\nChairman of the Inspector Morse Society Dr Antony Richards said: \"I have known Colin for about 30 years and the society, which has been going for about 20 years, has about 400 members from across the country.\n\n\u201cWe have a big meeting once a year and Colin usually comes along, although he couldn\u2019t make it last year because he was too ill to travel to Cambridge.\n\n\u201cAbout 25 years ago I had to introduce Colin at a Sherlock Holmes society dinner and I intended to say that he was an intellectual teddy bear but I ended up saying he had the intellect of a teddy bear.\n\n\u201cOf course Colin was a great intellectual with a great sense of humour and the personality to go with it \u2013 we will all miss him a great deal and our thoughts are with his wife Dorothy and his family.\u201d\n\nDr Antony Richards with Colin Dexter at the Randolph Hotel in Oxford.", 
        "body0": "Though he thought of himself primarily as a school teacher, Colin Dexter will be remembered as the crime writer who created the curmudgeonly but entertaining Inspector Morse. Morse, the beer, crossword and Wagner-loving detective who drives a vintage Jaguar around Oxford, solves murders by deep thinking, often about chance remarks made by his sidekick, Sergeant Lewis.\n\nDexter, who has died aged 86, claimed that he was no writer, but could revise his \u201cbad starts\u201d into something that worked. The formula was certainly a success for some dozen Morse novels and many original scripts for television, the medium that delivered the doings of the idiosyncratic Morse to an audience across 50 countries. \u201cI just started writing and forced myself to keep going,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s been the same ever since.\u201d\n\nIntellectually rather like Morse, Dexter was a master of the literary high wire. Morse\u2019s first name was kept under wraps for years, always presenting audiences with a riddle to be solved \u2013 a riddle almost as interesting as the one about why Morse, though presented as constantly falling in love with women, never married one.\n\nOnly gradually was it leaked out that his first name began with an E. But the secret about his first name \u2013 in real life it would have appeared on documents easily accessible at the police station \u2013 was not dispelled until 1996, when there was a landslide of useful publicity about the disclosure that the name was not Edward, nor Ernest, or even Enoch, as some pundits had speculated, but Endeavour \u2013 because Morse\u2019s parents had been Quakers who greatly admired Captain Cook, whose ship bore that name.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Colin Dexter, right, with John Thaw (Morse), left, and Kevin Whately (Lewis) on the set of the Inspector Morse TV series. Photograph: ITV/Rex/Shutterstock\n\nDexter happily went along with publicity strategies to boost Morse because he felt he owed a debt of gratitude to his publishers but, like Morse, he hated cant and pretentiousness. He made millions out of Morse but lived in the same four-bedroomed house in Oxford that he had occupied since moving to the city in 1966.\n\nHe was neither impressed by displays of wealth nor anxious to live up to his income, his main sybaritic expenditure being on red wine, Flowers beer, whisky and his car. The last of these was as elderly as Morse\u2019s, but of a lesser make. The one extravagance to which Dexter would admit was his purchase of the first editions of the works of AE Housman. He had planned to write a book on Housman when he finished with his detective, but found by that time that other writers had cornered the market.\n\nDexter was born in Stamford, Lincolnshire. His father, Alfred, was a taxi driver who had left school at 12, as had Colin\u2019s mother, Dorothy (nee Towns), and was determined that Colin and his elder brother, John, should be well educated. The boys were not required to do any domestic chores but were expected to spend every available moment studying. Both gained scholarships to the independent Stamford school, and Colin then went to Christ\u2019s College, Cambridge, where he studied classics.\n\nInspector Morse creator Colin Dexter dead at 86 Read more\n\nHe became a classics teacher, claiming for the rest of his life that he was a born teacher rather than a writer: he took no interest in the moral welfare of his pupils but prided himelf on getting them better exam results than they thought they were capable of. He taught at schools in Loughborough and Leicester, and by his mid-30s was head of classics at a school in Corby, Northamptonshire. It was there that he discovered there was something seriously wrong with his hearing.\n\nHe was teaching The Aeneid, Book II, when he began to feel that there was something going on that he knew nothing about. In fact, pupils in the fifth form were playing pop music during his lessons at ever increasing volume, but he could not hear it. His family history might have warned him of approaching danger: all four of his grandparents, an uncle and his father became deaf.\n\nThis had the effect of making him seek a second career in which impaired hearing would not be a disadvantage. So he became a GCE examiner for the Oxford University Board. It required him to move to Oxford, and he remained there from 1966 until 1987, by which time Morse had changed his life.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Last Bus to Woodstock, 1988, starring John Thaw as Inspector Morse\n\nThe first of the Inspector Morse novels, Last Bus To Woodstock (1975), was written because, with his wife, Dorothy, and two sons, Dexter was on holiday in north Wales at a time when the rain never seemed to stop. Thoroughly miserable and bored, he read both the detective novels in their holiday accommodation, decided that they were not much good and thought he could do better. With the benefit of medieval and suburban Oxford as the setting (Dexter reckoned that he would never have become a writer had he moved to Rotherham), Last Bus to Woodstock proved the point.\n\nThe names for the characters were chosen with the same liking for intellectual riddles as the plots. He chose the name for Morse, and for all the others in the novel, except for the murderer, from a crossword, at a time when he entered regularly for the Observer Ximenes puzzle, which was won more often by Sir Jeremy Morse and a Mrs B Lewis.\n\nOnce it was obvious that he had found a winning character and setting, Dexter seriously set about writing detective novels. There were 12 more in the Morse series, including Service of All the Dead (1979), for which he won the Silver Dagger award of the Crime Writers\u2019 Association, The Dead of Jericho (1981), another Silver Dagger-winner, The Wench is Dead (1989), for which he won the Gold Dagger, The Way Through the Woods (1992), another Gold Dagger-winner, and the last, The Remorseful Day (1999), which killed off Morse, as well as a short-story collection, Morse\u2019s Greatest Mystery (1993).\n\nThe first of 33 episodes of the Inspector Morse television series was presented in 1987, with John Thaw as Morse and Kevin Whately as Lewis, and Dexter himself appearing in various cameos. When the novels ran out, Dexter wrote additional scripts for Morse before turning over the series to other writers. The last episode, in 2000, featured Morse\u2019s death, and after Thaw\u2019s death in 2002, Dexter stipulated that no other actor should reprise the role. However, the story continued in a spin-off series, Lewis (2006-15), and a prequel series, Endeavour, with Shaun Evans as the young Morse, which began in 2012.\n\nDexter was often asked whether he wrote for a readership or for himself. His answer was that he wrote for his old English teacher Mr Sharp. He would write a page and then ask himself, \u201cWould Mr Sharp like that?\u201d His aim was to feel that Mr Sharp would give it at least eight out of 10.\n\nDexter was appointed OBE in 2000. He is survived by Dorothy (nee Cooper), whom he married in 1956, their children Jeremy and Sally, and two grandsons, Thomas and James.\n\n\u2022 Norman Colin Dexter, teacher and writer, born 29 September 1930; died 21 March 2017\n\n\u2022 Dennis Barker died in 2015",

Its book comes from Downton Abbey scribe Julian Fellowes.\n\nThe show, directed by Laurence Connor, originally opened on Broadway in December 2015 at the Winter Garden Theatre, where it\u2019s still playing. The London production open in November 2016.\n\nMeanwhile, Mel C has been focusing her time on supporting her newest album, Version of Me. And while she\u2019s not afraid to perform some Spice Girls classics from time to time, she has no plans for reuniting with her former bandmates Melanie \u201cScary Spice\u201d Brown, Geri \u201cGinger Spice\u201d Halliwell Horner and Emma \u201cBaby Spice\u201d Bunton \u2014 who have reunited as a new spinoff group GEM (a name made from the initials of their first names).\n\nRELATED VIDEO: 7 Most Expensive Music Videos\n\n\u201cTruth be told, earlier this year after several face-to-face meetings with the girls I made the difficult decision not to be part of a proposed reunion with Emma, Geri and Melanie,\u201d Chisholm wrote in a personal essay for the September issue of U.K.\u2019s Love Magazine.\n\n\u201c[Victoria Beckham] had already bowed out understandably with the demands of her fashion label and her rather large family,\u201d she revealed \u2014 noting, for her, the \u201cpinnacle\u201d of her Spice existence was performing at the 2012 London Olympics for millions of people around the world.\n\nAs for what\u2019s to come for GEM, plans still haven\u2019t been announced since the ladies first announced the grouping in July \u2014 built as a celebration for their 20th anniversary. Whether they choose to head out on a tour, put out an album, or just a few new songs, the ladies have promised to give fans \u201cwhat they want, what they really really want.\u201d",

        "body1": "With free agency fully slowed down, the draft will start to gain even more attention this week. Locally in Michigan, both Michigan State and the University of Michigan have their Pro Days this week -- as do many other schools around the country.\n\nWith the Detroit Lions holding the No. 21 pick in the draft, they are going to start to look heavily at what prospects might fit them best for the end of April. With that in mind, we take today\u2019s Lions Mailbag question.\n\nTo ask a future Mailbag question, use the hashtag #LionsMailbag on Twitter, email me at michael.rothstein@espn.com or follow along on Facebook and ask there.\n\nNow, on to today\u2019s question.\n\n@mikerothstein if your bob Quinn who and what position do you address first in the Draft #Lionsmailbag \u2014 \u303dichigan vs Nation (@AndrewBuris) March 20, 2017\n\nAndrew,\n\nThe easiest answer here is the best player available at a position of need -- so basically anywhere other than quarterback or offensive line. That said, there are spots on the Lions' roster that are needier than others.\n\nThe good thing for the Lions is the draft is deep on the defensive line, at linebacker and at cornerback, so if a high-level player at another position happens to slip in the draft and is sitting there at No. 21, Detroit could make that move and still pick up quality players at key positions in later rounds. For instance, it would be highly surprising if a receiver like Mike Williams or a running back like Leonard Fournette fell to No. 21. If they did, the Lions might consider them -- same with Alabama tight end O.J. Howard if he\u2019s around at No. 21.\n\nProvided those things don\u2019t happen, figure the Lions are going to look at a player who can be an upgrade on defense -- either as a pass-rusher or a do-it-all linebacker. This, though, is where names will differ. Among the defensive linemen, Tennessee\u2019s Derek Barnett, Missouri\u2019s Charles Harris and Michigan's Taco Charlton would be good fits as pass-rushing defensive ends. The Lions will likely also do their research on Michigan State defensive tackle Malik McDowell.\n\nAt linebacker, Temple\u2019s Haason Reddick is a popular choice at No. 21 as a three-down linebacker who can be a playmaker on the weak side -- the position vacated by the release of DeAndre Levy. He would probably compete with free agent Paul Worrilow for that role -- or maybe another former Temple linebacker, Tahir Whitehead.\n\nUCLA\u2019s Takkarist McKinley, Alabama\u2019s Tim Williams, Wisconsin\u2019s T.J. Watt, Florida\u2019s Jarrad Davis, Ohio State\u2019s Raekwon McMillan and Vanderbilt\u2019s Zach Cunninham all could be in play as well, either in the first round or the second for Detroit. That\u2019s how deep the linebacker group is this year.\n\nThere\u2019s also the chance Detroit could make a move in its secondary since cornerback Nevin Lawson and safeties Glover Quin and Tavon Wilson are all in contract years. Ohio State\u2019s Gareon Conley and Alabama\u2019s Marlon Humphrey could be intriguing cornerback options at No. 21, particularly if the Lions think there\u2019s more depth in the front seven to be had later on. Adoree Jackson, a cornerback/returner from USC, is a name to watch -- not necessarily at No. 21 but he could be a good fit in the second round.\n\nThen there\u2019s one of the most versatile players in the draft, Michigan safety Jabrill Peppers. If he\u2019s available at No. 21, the Lions almost have to at least take a look at him. Peppers can provide an immediate boost to the return game and would be an interesting piece for defensive coordinator Teryl Austin to use. The issue there would be that he fits a similar role, defensively, to how the Lions use Miles Killebrew. But with their own safeties heading toward a potential season of flux in 2018 and Peppers able to play multiple positions, as he did at Michigan, he might warrant consideration.",

Video courtesy of Standard Life Investments\n\nMartin Johnson said on current form Wales' Alun Wyn Jones is the man to lead the British and Irish Lions in June.\n\nJones took up the Wales captaincy after Sam Warburton stepped down ahead of the Six Nations, and Johnson has backed the 116-cap international to lead the Lions in New Zealand.\n\n\"As the tournament has gone on I just thought Alun Wyn Jones has played really well,\" said Johnson. \"Right now if you're picking a Test team I'd pick him in the second row and I'd pick him as captain.

He's a more mature player than he was four years ago.\"\n\nAlun Wyn Jones led the Lions to victory in the third Test of the 2013 series\n\nThe 10-game tour of New Zealand represents the biggest challenge these players will ever face, says Johnson, but urged those involved to write their names in the history books.\n\n\"The challenge is the biggest in rugby, simple as that. New Zealand are always very good - that goes back from the dawn of rugby time.\n\n\"Win a series down there, you go with the immortals straight away in a very special group of players. It's worth the effort, it's worth the sacrifice to put everything into that six or seven weeks.\"\n\nSir Ian McGeechan says Sam Warburton should be picked as Lions captain\n\nThe players will no longer have a chance to showcase their credentials on the international stage, as the Six Nations concluded in thrilling fashion in Dublin on Saturday.\n\nEngland's hopes of a tier one record of 19 consecutive Test victories were halted by Ireland at the Aviva Stadium, with Joe Schmidt's side winning 13-9 to finish second in the championship.\n\n\"The nature of Ireland's performance I don't think would have been any surprise to anyone, that's how they're going to play,\" said Johnson.\n\n\"They can handle the wet weather - they played like that against France - they're going to play with a huge amount of passion; you have to take that away from them and force them into errors.\n\nJohnson says England will learn from their loss to Ireland in Dublin\n\n\"It was a typical Six Nations game. Those games have been happening since before I was even playing the game. It's nice that things don't change but it was disappointing from England's point of view.\"\n\nThe 2003 World Cup winner says England will learn from the loss and benefit from it in the long term.\n\n\"If you're winning two consecutive Grand Slams everything's fine - you do need to sometimes be brought back down to earth.\n\n\"I said before the game it's a survivable loss for England, they're still going to be champions - and even if they weren't, it's survivable.\"", 
        "body2": "The auditions are almost over. Time to select the cast. It\u2019s time for Warren Gatland to retreat to the bunker at the end of the garden, sharpen his pencil, find the big notepad and draw up his final squad to beat the most dominant team in sporting history.\n\nThe British & Irish Lions coach has one day short of a month to pick his touring side. He has watched the contenders beat seven bells out of each other for the last month, some will have risen in his expectations, some fallen. But who is in contention to be selected on April 19? Here we look at the runners and riders for the most daunting task in sport \u2013 beating New Zealand at least twice on their own paddock this summer.\n\nOf course there are vital European Champions Cup matches to come, and several stars may suffer the crushing blow of last-minute injuries or tour-busting bans, but as it stands these are the men in contention for each position.\n\nWarren Gatland has until April 19 to make his selections for the Lions tour of New Zealand\n\nFULL-BACK\n\nStuart Hogg has played his way into \u2018dert-cert\u2019 territory here with Welsh duo Leigh Halfpenny and Liam Williams probably fighting it out for one spot behind him.\n\nThe case to pick 2013 Lions man of the series Halfpenny is boosted by the presence of Neil Jenkins as the kicking coach for this tour \u2013 but the Toulon man is nowhere near as good as he was four years ago. Can you beat the All Blacks with him at full-back?\n\nWilliams has played on the left wing exclusively for Wales in the Six Nations, but really is a better full-back so should be considered there. His was also brilliant in the tour to New Zealand last summer, even if Wales lost 3-0.\n\nRob Kearney could force his way onto a third tour but probably needs a few stunning games for Leinster to make it \u2013 he would be a safe pick and is far more assured as a bomb-disposing expert than the others when the high-balls rain down. Mike Brown\u2019s chances look slimmer by the match.\n\nStuart Hogg appears to be one of the certainties to be picked on the Lions tour\n\nWING\n\nA plethora of options here. You may as well carve George North and Elliot Daly\u2019s names in stone now \u2013 Daly has been the find of the last six months and can play three positions so would be a perfect No 23 in the Test squad. North is sure to go. Even if he had not come back into form he would have made it \u2013 his impending battle with Julian Savea will echo the war with Israel Folau from the Australia tour, two behemoths battering into each other. Excellent.\n\nElsewhere you have flyers and grafters. In the former category put Simon Zebo, Anthony Watson, Jonny May and Sean Maitland, the latter Tommy Seymour, Jack Nowell and Keith Earls \u2013 there will be a smattering of both. Tim Visser probably won\u2019t make it as a North mark II figure \u2013 he probably does not offer enough other than finishing.\n\nAnd what about Christian Wade? Under-appreciated by England, toured in 2013 and always scores tries \u2013 could he be a left-field shout? His defence may be his downfall though.\n\nElliot Daly starred for England during the Six Nations and is a long-range kicking option\n\nCENTRE\n\nJonathan Joseph is not only the best attacking No 13 in the northern hemisphere at the moment, he is the best defensive one too. He goes. And if we are classing Owen Farrell as an inside centre, then he is even more certain to go in this slot than his English outside man.\n\nSo who\u2019s left? Alex Dunbar gave a strong impression of a revolving door against England so his application has found its way into the round filing cabinet, his Scottish partner Huw Jones could be a bolter, but probably won\u2019t be.\n\nThat\u2019s a similar scenario for 22-year-old Garry Ringrose \u2013 good in parts, not good enough in others. When picking a Lions tour squad youth should be trumped by the ace-card experience \u2013 there is no future planning here, only the best can go.\n\nRobbie Henshaw is an odd one. He was pretty much perfect against New Zealand in the Chicago win, but alarmingly looked powerless and one-dimensional against the Welsh red wall of defence in Cardiff. A huge hitter though and will tour.\n\nThen it\u2019s another Welsh shootout. Gatland will probably have to pick between Scott Williams and Jonathan Davies \u2013 neither ripped up trees in the Six Nations and Wales scored just eight tries in five games with them at the creative controls. At the moment he would probably plump for Davies, but it\u2019s tight.\n\nJonathan Joseph's attacking capabilities came to the fore for England in recent weeks\n\nFLY-HALF\n\nNo arguments about two slots here, loads about the other one. Jonathan Sexton and Owen Farrell are probably the two most important players for this prospective Lions squad \u2013 the questions over whether they can play together or if they will be rugby\u2019s equivalent of a Steven Gerrard and Frank Lampard combination can wait, barring injury they are the first two names typed onto the squad announcement press-release.\n\nThen it is a question of George Ford, Dan Biggar, Finn Russell. You would probably only take one of those. Russell is the maverick choice, but in games against England and for Glasgow against Munster he blotted his copybook leaving an indelible mark. Too much of a risk. Biggar is maybe the Sexton-lite \u2013 hard, consistent, demanding of others but not as influential as the Irishman. Ford has formed half of the most potent European playmaking partnership in recent times, but can be targeted in defence.\n\nThese are ones that come down to personal preference rather than necessarily who is the best player. Let\u2019s go for Ford then, remembering that Biggar will be in Auckland touring the Pacific with Wales, so is only an uber away from the Lions hotel\u2026\n\nOwen Farrell has been shortlisted for Six Nations player of the tournament\n\nSCRUM-HALF\n\nOk, this is easy. Conor Murray \u2013 controlling master. Rhys Webb \u2013 rapid wind-up merchant. Tick, tick. The less easy pick is the third and final slot.\n\nGreig Laidlaw? Probably not \u2013 we won\u2019t hold his tweed waistcoat, as displayed on ITV for the England match, against him, he is probably not quite good enough to tour. Injury may also play against him.\n\nBen Youngs? Danny Care? One of two you feel. Care would provide more as a \u2018finisher\u2019, sorry, substitute \u2013 blame Eddie \u2013 but is Youngs the better player and more likely to cover for Murray like he did four years ago? I reckon so. Care\u2019s kicking from hand is an issue that cannot be swept under the carpet.\n\nRhys Webb is one of those in contention but will have to impress in midweek matches\n\nPROP\n\nRight, two pairs need to go here. Jack McGrath and Tadhg Furlong have stormed onto the international stage \u2013 particularly Furlong, who was immense against the All Blacks last November and is the best young tight-head in the world.\n\nJoe Marler and Dan Cole should also make it \u2013 their scrummaging power and work around the field is very strong. You would imagine they would both be \u2018good tourists\u2019 too. Add Mako Vunipola to that \u2013 the best ball-playing front-rower in the world \u2013 and you have a strong set.\n\nAnd as the Lions go through props more quickly than their fans will pints of beer on tour, Gatland is likely to boost the numbers with 21-year-old Zander Fagerson, with the likes of Kyle Sinckler, Rob Evans, Samson Lee, Cian Healy and WP Nel (if fit in time) told to keep their eye in at the gym in case of inevitable late call-ups.\n\nTadhg Furlong (left) and Jack McGrath (right) have burst onto the scene for Ireland\n\nHOOKER\n\nAnd so to an area of controversy. England captains have a recent habit of missing Lions tours. Chris Robshaw was discarded from the last one after the 30-3 mauling by Wales on the final day of the 2013 Six Nations, and Dylan Hartley may be the next.\n\nIt would be a big call \u2013 this is a man who has lost just once when leading his country, who are clearly the best of the Lions nations. But Jamie George is an itch that needs to be scratched. Surely the Saracens man is so good he cannot be overlooked? Could he even play for the Lions before he starts for England? It has been done before \u2013 Will Greenwood completed that feat in 1997.\n\nAnd what about \u2018Cannonball\u2019 Ken Owens? Nominated for Six Nations player of the Championship, the Welshman is combative and strong in the set-piece.\n\nThen there is Rory Best \u2013 the only current captain to have beaten New Zealand. Is his lineout throwing reliable enough?\n\nRory Best faces some stiff competition at hooker with Dylan Hartley and Jamie George options\n\nSECOND-ROW\n\nThe problem here is too many options. Unfortunately you cannot realistically take 11 locks, so some huge names will miss out in this department.\n\nAlun Wyn Jones is a cast-iron tourist. Maro Itoje and Joe Launchbury too. But then Courtney Lawes has been staggeringly good and George Kruis was monumental before injury \u2013 that is just the English.\n\nIain Henderson is a star who can also play at No.6, Donncha Ryan seems carved out of stone.\n\nThe fact that neither of the brothers Gray \u2013 Richie and Jonny \u2013 may make the tour shows the remarkable strength in this area.\n\nOh, and then there is Jake Ball and Luke Charteris. What to do!?\n\nAlun Wyn-Jones has been touted as a potential captain but was injured against France\n\nBACK-ROW\n\nNearly there! This is an area full of stars, and again, some monumental players will have to watch from 12,000 miles away. We all know about Billy Vunipola, Taulupe Faletau and Sam Warburton \u2013 they are all on the plane, no worries. But then it is all about balance \u2013 Justin Tipuric is probably the only proper \u2018seven\u2019 available \u2013 someone who has great hands, is fast, agile and turns over ball at the breakdown, so he will go too.\n\nThen it is a list of bashers. CJ Stander \u2013 a giant. Ross Moriarty \u2013 a colossus. James Haskell \u2013 a warrior. Sean O\u2019Brien \u2013 the Tullow tank.\n\nAnd then what about Peter O\u2019Mahony? He was such a mammoth against England that it is hard to leave him in Cork.\n\nBilly Vunipola returned early from injury and gives Warren Gatland another back row option\n\nJamie Heaslip may have to pray for injuries to make a third tour, Nathan Hughes too. Tom Wood and Chris Robshaw may be crushed by lack of game-time, both would never let you down though.\n\nWhat of some Scots too? John Barclay, John Hardie, Ryan Wilson, Hamish Watson? You might squeeze Watson in if you feel there are too many blind-sides on the A380 aeroplane south.\n\nWherever you look there are so many good players \u2013 but who will make it? A month to finalise the squad. Gatland will probably not pick more than 38 players, he has said as much himself.\n\nMake no mistake \u2013 if the Lions win in New Zealand it will be one of the great sporting achievements of all time. The schedule, the time together, the opposition, the country, all those records \u2013 it\u2019s a daunting task.\n\nGatland better get it right then, and he has a month of scribbling in the shed left.\n\nHamish Watson is one of those with an outside chance at being selected on the tour\n\nMY LIONS SQUAD TO TOUR NEW ZEALAND\n\nFORWARDS (21)\n\nProps: Mako Vunipola, Joe Marler, Jack McGrath, Tadhg Furlong, Dan Cole, Zander Fagerson\n\nHookers: Dylan Hartley, Ken Owens, Jamie George\n\nLocks: Alun Wyn Jones \u00a9, Maro Itoje, Joe Launchbury, Courtney Lawes, George Kruis\n\nBack row: CJ Stander, James Haskell, Sam Warburton, Justin Tipuric, Ross Moriarty, Billy Vunipola, Taulupe Faletau\n\nBACKS (17)\n\nScrum-halves: Conor Murray, Rhys Webb, Ben Youngs\n\nFly-halves: Jonathan Sexton, George Ford\n\nCentres: Owen Farrell, Robbie Henshaw, Jonathan Joseph, Jonathan Davies\n\nWings: George North, Elliot Daly, Simon Zebo, Tommy Seymour, Jack Nowell, Anthony Watson\n\nFull-backs: Stuart Hogg, Liam Williams",

But at the start of the year he found himself searching for a club after a spell at Galatasaray went sour.\n\nLuckily, Wanderers\u2019 needs matched his own \u2013 and Le Fondre thinks his former Royals team-mate brings exactly the right qualities to a promotion battle.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a very, very good player,\u201d he told The Bolton News. \u201cI spoke to a few people here to tell them to bring him in because Jem has got it all. He\u2019s got great energy and a real calmness on the ball as well. You bring in players of that ilk \u2013 he\u2019s played at Reading with me and at clubs like Galatasaray, it can\u2019t be a bad thing.\n\n\u201cHe has got a lot to prove but he\u2019s the same as most of us here. We have got a lot to prove to people who didn\u2019t value us.\n\n\u201cOn a personal level a lot of us are out of contract, so we have something to prove on that front as well.\u201d\n\nLe Fondre speaks from experience, having sat miserably on the bench for most of the last 18 months at Wolves and Wigan Athletic.\n\nHe finally returned to his \u2018spiritual home\u2019 at the Macron and now appears to be hitting his stride, scoring three goals in his last two outings.\n\n\u2018Alfie\u2019 became a terrace hero in his first loan spell at Bolton, and continues to enjoy the adulation of fans at the Macron.\n\n\u201cFans are one of the main reasons I came back here \u2013 they are outstanding,\u201d he said. \u201cThey love me and I have to give everything I can to try and repay that, getting this great club back up to where it belongs.\u201d\n\nNorthampton arrive tomorrow in a decent run of form, beating Charlton, AFC Wimbledon and Port Vale in their last three games.\n\nWanderers scrapped for a narrow win at Sixfields back in November, courtesy of a Zach Clough strike and Le Fondre \u2013 who has filled the goalscorer\u2019s mantle since the youngster left for Nottingham Forest in January \u2013 is prepared to roll up his sleeves once again.\n\n\u201cI think we have got what it takes to go up,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we know it will be a fight.\n\n\u201cWe have a lot of players who suit that.\n\n\u201cIn any league you have to earn the right to play good football. It doesn\u2019t just happen.\u201d\n\nLe Fondre has had to wait for success in his return to the club and admits it took him longer than expected to get up to full speed after so long kicking his heels on the Wigan sidelines.\n\n\u201cWhen January came and went we had a big change-round where players came in who hadn\u2019t had much football, like myself, and we were expected to hit the ground running. We didn\u2019t really do it,\u201d admitted Le Fondre. \u201cWe had that sticky patch but we stuck together as a group and hopefully now we\u2019re out the other side.\u201d", 
        "body0": "The lower league veteran has three in four, rejuvinating Bolton Wanderers' promotion hopes.\n\nWhen Bolton Wanderers were forced to bid farewell to talismanic forward Zach Clough in January, their promotion hopes appeared to disappear with him. And, just over a month after the diminutive attacker left for Nottingham Forest, The Trotters dropped nine points off the top following four games without a win.\n\nTherefore, it\u2019s a credit to the character of Phil Parkinson\u2019s side, who were only saved from administration in November, that they have now clawed their way back up to second place, a point above Fleetwood Town with a game in hand thanks to three successive wins including a 4-2 thrashing of the Cod Army at Highbury.\n\nAnd Adam Le Fondre, who looked lost initially after the departure of key creator Clough, has been at the centre of Bolton\u2019s recent rejuvenation. He\u2019s scored four in three now, the 30-year-old enjoying his most prolific spell of the season after arriving on loan from Wigan in January.\n\nHowever, this may not have been possible without one of the more understated members of Bolton\u2019s squad. Le Fondre is a player who thrives on the service of others, a true penalty box poacher. So the loss of Clough, a player with the ability to thread the ball through the eye of the needle, appeared to render his presence in the team somewhat futile.\n\nUntil Gary Madine offered a timely reminder of his worth that is. The 6ft 3ins targetman was battered from pillar to post in Saturday\u2019s 2-1 win against Northampton but he almost sacrifices himself for the good of Le Fondre.\n\nHolding up the ball, linking the play and flicking it on for his partner, Madine appears the perfect foil for the former Reading poacher.\n\nSEE ALSO: 19 game goal drought: Bolton Wanderers will not regret releasing striker\n\nIn its simplest form, Phil Parkinson has adopted a variation of the \u2018big man, little man\u2019 partnership.

        "body2": "RISKY business paid off for Wanderers at Fleetwood, and who is to say it will not for the rest of the season?\n\nA penny for the rest of League One\u2019s thoughts as Phil Parkinson\u2019s team sheet became public knowledge on Saturday afternoon.\n\nA club in transfer embargo, restricted to 23 players according to the Football League\u2019s own statement, managed to negotiate the return of powerful midfielder Darren Pratley to the quota and bring in a potentially game-changing signing in Jem Karacan with just a dozen games to go.\n\nQuite how they managed it, considering the EFL\u2019s rather stern reminder of the rules on Friday night, remains a mystery.\n\nFew celebrating this terrific win this weekend were bothered about the details.\n\nCall it brazen audacity, call it a gamble, call it what you will, but if the Whites end up playing Championship football next season, Ken Anderson won\u2019t care about a few sour grapes from elsewhere.\n\nWanderers are pulling every trick in the book to get promotion and may be making enemies elsewhere in doing so. Right now you could argue that the ends justify the means.\n\nFour goals at Fleetwood \u2013 including two from Adam Le Fondre \u2013 was, in the striker\u2019s own words, \u201ca statement\u201d.\n\nThis was a team unbeaten in 18 games, sitting second in the table, watched by a sizeable portion of the town\u2019s population.\n\nPress had been given open access to the Cod Army in the build-up to their biggest game of the season, celebrating what has been a glorious campaign so far.\n\nIn complete contrast, Wanderers ensured their plans remained a closely-guarded secret.\n\nAside from a public reprimand for Josh Vela over his Sunday lunchtime incident last Sunday, Parkinson\u2019s pre-match words had been deliberately vague on team matters.\n\nBeing able to call on Pratley for the run-in is priceless for a team which had lacked midfield mobility in Jay Spearing\u2019s absence.\n\nThe club captain had been due to play against Nottingham Forest in an under-23 game in midweek but after it was postponed he impressed in a training match at Lostock on Thursday, convincing Parkinson to push for his inclusion.\n\nPratley rewarded that faith with a quite heroic display in the middle of the park, eating up space like he had never been away.\n\nJust as surprising has been the return of French defender Dorian Dervite, once the forgotten man of the squad, now looking right at home as part of a strong back three.\n\nAway days don\u2019t come much better than this for the discerning Wanderers fan.\n\nSomething about the coaches circling endlessly up and down the double-parked streets, the snaking queues outside the chippy and the higgledy-piggledy terraced housing that surrounds Highbury transported this fixture back in time way before a ball was kicked.\n\nOf the 1,350 supporters lucky enough to get a ticket for the two sides of the ground allocated, not too many will remember the days when Wanderers used to descend regularly en masse to unfashionable venues like this.\n\nIf they are successful in their promotion chase, such atmospheres will be one of the few things missed about life in the third tier.\n\nFor an old fashioned occasion, cue a traditional winger, and few fit the bill quite like Filipe Morais. Discarded by Bradford City \u2013 most wrote the 31-year-old off as a squad filler when Parkinson brought him to the Macron.\n\nInstead, his infectious workrate on the right, and ability to swing in crosses and set pieces with deadly-eyed accuracy have seen him rise to being the season\u2019s surprise package.\n\nMorais finished the day with three assists, his efforts met with a thoroughly deserved standing ovation from the Bolton fans each time he walked to the touchline to take a throw or corner.\n\nWanderers fans had every right to think this would be a tight and tense affair, yet from the moment Le Fondre hooked a freakish opening goal from the right wing it proved to be immensely open and enjoyable.\n\nHad it not been for a perfectly-executed challenge by Andy Taylor on David Ball, the Whites might have fallen behind on 17 minutes. Instead, Le Fondre galloped away down the right to hit a cross-shot which bamboozled the Fleetwood keeper and nestled into the net.\n\nThree minutes later, Morais swung in a devilish free kick which dropped perfectly for Wheater to hammer home left-footed at the far post to double the lead.\n\nThe big defender had two goals disallowed, which amounted to a theoretical perfect hat-trick.\n\nHe will have to console himself with the knowledge he has now scored more goals this season \u2013 six \u2013 than in his previous six seasons combined.\n\nKyle Dempsey brought things crashing back down to earth with a deflected effort from the edge of the box a few minutes later.\n\nFleetwood\u2019s intricate football asked plenty of questions of Wanderers\u2019 back three \u2013 all of whom were called upon to make important interventions before half time.\n\nUwe Rosler had noted the Whites\u2019 prowess at set pieces before the game, and his concern proved entirely justified.\n\nPanic set in each time the ball was whipped into the box by Morais and both Vela and Madine went close to making it three.\n\nBeevers did just that two minutes after the restart \u2013 ghosting in to stab home his third goal of the campaign within touching distance of the Bolton faithful.\n\nLe Fondre\u2019s chasing hassled a mistake out of keeper Alex Cairns, Morais dropping a 50-yard lobbed effort just over the bar. But a game-sealing fourth was not so far away.\n\nAgain Morais galloped down the right to arrow a cross to the near post, the ball met with perfect timing by Le Fondre\u2019s head.\n\nNo debate about whether he meant that one.\n\nFleetwood continued to press and did get a consolation, Bobby Grant passing the ball home after a rare lapse in concentration at the back for Bolton.\n\nBut there was no route back.",

Blizzard confirmed today that the 24th hero and sixth tank to join the Overwatch lineup can now be played in Arcade and Quick Play, but will not be available to try out in Competitive Play. \"When patch 1.9 releases, Orisa will not initially be available for Competitive Play,\" a Blizzard development team message explains. \"We want to give players some time to learn about and play Orisa before she's placed into the crucible of Competitive Play. \"She'll still be immediately available in Quick Play, the Arcade (including custom games with the competitive ruleset), and Play vs. AI.\" Other general changes made to the game have also been confirmed in newly released patch notes, including: Competitive Play On Route 66, the attacking team is now given 60 additional seconds after pushing the payload to the first checkpoint.\n\nDeveloper Comments: This change will bring Route 66 in line with the other Escort maps.

Though some Overwatch players have already seen what the new tank character has to offer in the games PTR, you can expect the Orisa update to land at around 6pm tonight. In all probability, Blizzard is also expected to reveal a full set of patch notes for the latest update. However, If you were planning on using the new Orisa character in Competitive Play right away, think again. you may be disappointed to know that you won\u2019t be able to that just yet. Blizzard says that, for one week after release, Orisa will not be accessible in Competitive Play. Blizzard has said that, for one week after release, Orisa will not be accessible in Competitive Play. They've explained that the reason for this is so that the developer can ensure everyone spends enough time with her in casual so that they can learn her abilities and how to best play as or counter her. Quick Play or Arcade mode is fair game though and no sooner that you've downloaded the update can you start using Orisa and her many skins in those modes. ou\u2019ll also be able to select Orisa in bot matches. You\u2019ll also be able to select Orisa in bot matches.\n\nNew Overwatch Hero: Orisa screenshots Tuesday, 7th March 2017 Take a quick look at the new Overwatch Hero, Orisa 1 / 6\n\nORIGINAL STORY Overwatch character Orisa is set to go live within 24 hours as the countdown until the newest hero's release date on PS4, Xbox One and PC draws closer. Blizzard revealed the character's release date last week, telling fans that Orisa would be released on March 21 alongside a new update to the game. A tweet from the official Overwatch social channel read: \"Join us for a behind-the-scenes look at Overwatch's newest hero! Orisa activates: 3.21.2017\". Though no release time has been given for Orisa, typically Overwatch updates go live around 6PM UK time. Blizzard has described the new tank character as the \"central anchor of her team\" who \"defends her teammates from the frontline with a protective barrier.\" \"She can attack from long range, fortify her own defences, launch graviton charges to slow and move enemies, and deploy a Supercharger to boost the damage output of multiple allies at once.\" You can get a better look at the character in the video below which offers a behind the scenes look at Orisa from the Overwatch team.\n\nOrisa is released into the game after some extensive testing on the Overwatch PTR (Public Test Realm) and according to Express Online, Orisa has been in the PTR testing phase \"longer than usual, as Blizzard felt the need to make lots of balancing tweaks.\" The new Tank-class fighter is actually available on the Overwatch PTR now. According to the game's director, Jeff Kaplan, the decision was made to leave Orisa on the PTR for a little while as the developers were \"getting great feedback and fixing a lot of issues.\" Kaplan did apologise for the slightly more lengthy testing period, but assured fans \"we think it will be for the better.\"", 
        "body0": "It\u2019s been a few weeks since Blizzard announced Orisa, the latest character to join the ranks of Overwatch\u2019s heroes, and starting today she\u2019ll finally be available on Xbox One, PlayStation 4, and the primary PC servers.\n\nOrisa is a tank-class hero, meant to help soak up damage and defend softer and squishier allies. Her Ultimate ability, Supercharger, also allows her to dish out a temporary damage boost for her teammates, which can help save a late-minute attack or repel a final desperate push on defense.\n\nBlizzard has had Orisa available on the game\u2019s PTR (Public Test Region) servers since the character was first announced to give players some time to see how Orisa fit into the overall metagame and ensure balance, but today marks her addition to the actual primary servers and consoles.\n\nOrisa won\u2019t be added to the ranked Competitive mode until next week\n\nThere is a slight catch, however: in order to give players time to adjust to Orisa, Blizzard won\u2019t be adding her to the ranked Competitive mode until next week. So players looking to try out the new hero will have to do so in the Quick Play, Arcade, and Play vs. AI modes for now.\n\nOrisa is available as part of patch 1.9, which should be rolling out to Overwatch players on PC, Xbox One, and PlayStation 4 now.", 
        "body2": "With Orisa's New Introduction Video, Overwatch Keeps Insisting That Junkrat Is Useful Posted on Tuesday, March 21 @ 14:00:00 PST by James_Kozanitis\n\n\n\nI know all the Overwatch news is surrounding the introduction of Orisa, Overwatch's new tank hero and the 24th on its roster, but I want to talk about another hero who has seen some changes this patch: Junkrat. Luckily for me, these two stories overlap.\n\n\n\nYou see, Junkrat has had a long history of being either undesirable or completely useless, and the Overwatch team has spent the better part of the last few months insisting that that isn't the case, including, in the video above, introducing a hot new strategy to make Junkrat useful. In the video, Orisa uses her halt ability to pull the enemy McCree, Hanzo and Symmetra into a tight area where Junkrat then detonates his explosive ultimate ability, the RIP-Tire, killing all three of them. POTG.\n\n\n\nThere are many problems with this. First off, I just want to offer my condolences to any team out there that has a McCree, Hanzo and Symmetra. Tough break.\n\n\n\nSecondly, it's becoming obvious that Blizzard has reached a breaking point when it comes to Junkrat. They must know he isn't very good, but they're desperately grasping at straws to make him look good. I thought they hit max desperation when game designer Geoff Goodman\n\n\n\nLet's forget, for a second, that you can sneeze on Junkrat's RIP-tire to destroy it before it ever gets a chance at a lethal hit, and let's focus on Junkrat's actual problems.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCredit where credit is due, the Overwatch team did make it so Junkrat no longer harms himself with his own explosions. Even though that never should have been the case to begin with, I still say thank you. This will make Junkrat a lot more viable in close-range duels which would usually end with a loss or a draw, so good on you. And Junkrat is very good at breaking down barriers, which, especially with Orisa's addition, is a huge benefit to a team.\n\n\n\nThat being said, the principal issue with Junkrat still hasn't been addressed. Most heroes have what you could call a counter, but it doesn't render them useless. That's not the case with Junkrat. If the opposing team has anyone that can do reliable burst damage, say a Hanzo, Widowmaker or Pharah, you might as well switch off. He does fine against tanks, and OK against close-range DPS heroes, but those burst-damaging heroes completely shut him down. He'll do fine at the lower levels of play, because teams are often reluctant to switch heroes or simply don't know how to shut him down.\n\n\n\nAnd then there's the issue of team composition. Junkrat fits in a strange category that makes him not quite a tank, not quite a DPS, certainly not a healer, and not really the best for defense. So he's going to take up one of those roles, which means you'll have one less. Do you really want a Junkrat instead of a second DPS like a Pharah? Do you really want him instead of a second tank or a second healer? Do you really want him over much stronger defense heroes like Symmetra, Bastion or even Torbjorn?\n\n\n\nProbably not. In fact, at tournaments, he's almost non-existant and picking Junkrat in standard competitive play is bound to induce at least one or two groans from your teammates in teamchat. At best, you'd rather have someone else. At worst, he'll get his face stomped into the ground repeatedly.\n\n\n\nThey need to do something to increase his survivability, perhaps by giving him some shields or armor, or maybe by simply increasing his health to 250. They also could do something to buff the RIP-Tire, itself. I would suggest making it explode when destroyed rather than simply evaporating. Changes like that would certainly make him harder to counter and more viable, but right now, no matter how much insisting Blizzard does by contriving ridiculous scenarios like the one in Orisa's intro video, he's not a good pick.

Wordsworth\u2019s short free-kick saw Leonard let fly from 25 yards with a deflected effort that was still rising as it beat the helpless Ryan Burge.\n\nIt what was almost total one-way traffic, Coventry\u2019s token response came from an off- target Nathan Clarke header, before Ranger continued to torment the home defence, with the former Orient stopper, Clarke, working overtime.\n\nThe second-half was an almost total non-event with Southend\u2019s Ted Smith saving a weak 49th minute Callum Reilly effort, before John White did well to block a close-range Reilly effort in the closing stages.\n\nBrown said: \"A lot of harsh words were said after the Bristol Rovers game and we put it right tonight. From minute one to minute ninety-three, it summed up what we were talking about.\"\n\n\"Making the five changes tonight spiked the players. You have to say John White, Ryan Inniss, Stephen McLaughlin, Nile Ranger and Theo Robinson came in to join players who had been playing consistently well for twenty-five games. It was a good squad performance.\"\n\nBrown added: \"I have just watched the (first) goal and it was reminiscent of Nile Ranger when he played at Sheffield United, when Theo Robinson showed what he could do - dispossessing the centre-half as if he wasn\u2019t there, and laid a perfect pass on for Nile to net with a first-class, top drawer finish.\"\n\nBrown claimed: \"I\u2019ve got a big enough squad to make changes. Leaving the likes of Timlin and Demetriou back at home and being able to bring on the likes of McGlashan and Nouble, bodes well for Saturday.\"\n\n\"You look at Ryan Leonard. He ran his heart out. He got himself a goal. But he\u2019s wearing tape on his hamstring - and I\u2019ve really got to look at him regarding Saturday. One: if he\u2019s got the energy and two: to understand what Walsall\u2019s system brings to the party.\"\n\nMatchwinner Leonard said: \"We wanted to put last Saturday\u2019s result right tonight - as that (performance) was no where near good enough.\"\n\n\"It was a great start, with Wordsworth skimming the post inside the first thirty seconds. Then we got the first and then the second - and then we saw the game out quite comfortably.\"\n\nLeonard was entitled to be happy with his goal: \"I don\u2019t score bad ones, do I? It was nice to get the second, as it gave us that little bit of a cushion.

And he got the perfect reaction from his play-off chasing side who charged into a second minute lead and then doubled their advantage 21 minutes later from a fierce 30-yard free-kick.\n\nRobins was unhappy with the way his side defended against Bradford on Saturday and he won\u2019t be best pleased with the way Theo Robinson was allowed to mug Jordan Turnbull just as he was shaping up to clear down the line. Having out-muscled the centre-back near the touchline and well away from danger, the striker made a dash for the box and squared the ball to Nile Ranger who hit a precise finish past Lee Burge to inflict the early set-back. That set the tone for the visitors who were big and physical all over the park and clearly determined to make amends as they pushed forward looking to increase their lead and never let City settle for a second in the early exchanges as Robinson had a long-range effort deflected wide for a corner, from which Ranger headed over as United dominated the opening 20 minutes.\n\nCity\u2019s cause wasn\u2019t helped as they conceded a couple of free-kicks within shooting range, the second of which in the 23rd minute saw midfielder Ryan Leonard hit a powerful shot that took a wicked deflection to loop round Burge and into the top corner. What followed was as abject a performance as you can imagine as Coventry simply had no response. Robins made five changes to his side from the weekend as well as switching formation to 3-5-2 in a bid to secure his first win.\n\nThere was a return for Gael Bigirimana in the midfield where he linked up with Ben Stevenson, the pair getting their foot on the ball and trying to settle things down but United were relentless with their pressing and City struggled to deal with the pace and physicality of the front two and were guilty of giving away possession far too freely with stray passes in a truly dreadful first half display that incurred the wrath of the fans, who booed at the break, and Robins who, no doubt, will have had a few choice words for his players in the interval.\n\nIt had to go down as one of the worst 45 minute showings of the season \u2013 and there have been a few \u2013 as City looked shell-shocked and unable to react to the early goals against a side who out-fought and out-muscled them all over the park. Turnbull, who\u2019d had a shocker for the first goal, failed to return for the second period, replaced by forward Kwame Thomas as Robins changed back to a flat back four, and when Callum Reilly hit a low but tame shot on target in the 48th minute \u2013 only City\u2019s second of the game \u2013 it provoked ironic cheers from the home fans who sang, \u201cWe\u2019ve had a shot... We\u2019ve had a shot...\u201d\n\nMarcus Tudgay used all his experience to hold up the ball and did his level best to create openings while Bigirimana sent in a decent delivery that skimmed off the head of Anton Ferdinand as the Sky Blues attempted to restore a bid of pride. The one player who supporters couldn\u2019t fault for effort was the diminutive right-back Dion Kelly-Evans who rose to the physical battle, throwing himself into a crunching challenge to earn himself a yellow card and grappled with heavyweight front man Ranger despite the mis-match in size.\n\nStevenson also showed a bit of bite when he won a 50-50 that left full-back Ben Coker requiring treatment and the referee allowing play on for the talented midfielder to get a cross into the box, albeit headed clear by United\u2019s dominant centre-back Ryan Innis. Robins made a second change just after the hour when he sent on another forward, George Thomas, for Bigirimana who hadn\u2019t had his best game for the club, while former City centre-forward Marc-Antoine Fortune replaced Ranger shortly after for the visitors.\n\nAnother ex-City player, Frank Nouble, received a warm reception and a song from the suffering home fans when he went on to replace Stephen McLaughlin with seven minutes to go, the striker having had an exciting, if hot and cold spell with the club in 2014/15. Coventry huffed and puffed but never really looked like scoring against another side who saw the game out comfortably on a night when they took another step towards mathematical confirmation of the club\u2019s relegation to League Two, the defeat leaving them now a huge 17 points off the safety cut-off point occupied by Oldham who beat Oxford to stretch the gap.\n\nCity (3-5-2): Lee Burge; Farrend Rawson, Nathan Clarke, Jordan Turnbull (H/T for Kwame Thomas); Dion Kelly-Evans, Callum Reilly, Gael Bigirimana (61 mins, George Thomas), Ben Stevenson, Ryan Haynes; Stuart Beavon, Marcus Tudgay.\n\nSubstitutes (not used): Reice Charles-Cook (goalkeeper), Chris Stokes, Vlad Gadzhev, Kyel Reid, Ruben Lameiras.\n\nSouthend (4-4-2): Ted Smith; John White, Ryan Innis, Anton Ferdinand, Ben Coker; Will Atkinson, Ryan Leonard, Anthony Wordsworth, Stephen McLaughlin (83 mins, Frank Nouble); Nile Ranger (67 mins, for Marc-Antoine Fortune), Theo Robinson (77 mins, for Jermaine McGlashon).\n\nSubstitutes (not used): Nathan Bishop (goalkeeper), Luke O\u2019Neill, David Moody, Luke Amos.\n\nMatch analysis:\n\nHow did City set-up?\n\nMark Robins opted for 3-5-2 for the visit of the Shrimpers with Clarke, Turnbull and Rawson making up the defence. Ryan Haynes and Dion Kelly-Evans were employed as wing-backs, and Bigirimana returned to the side to play with Stevenson and Reilly in the middle. Beavon led the attack with Tudgay.\n\nHow did Southend set-up?\n\nPhil Brown went for a straight forward 4-4-2 at the Ricoh Arena with Ferdinand and Inniss made up the centre-back pairing with Coker and White making up the flanks. Nile Ranger and and Theo Robinson led the line and were given license to press high up the pitch.\n\nAttendance:\n\n7,646 (449 away)\n\nGoals:\n\n2 Mins. Turnbull was easily dispossessed, giving Robinson enough room to cut the ball back to Ranger, who fired home. 0-1\n\n22 Mins. Leonard hits a deflected free-kick from 30 yards which beats Lee Burge. 0-2\n\nBigi back in:\n\nThe midfielder struggled to impose himself on the game and looked short of match sharpness. He was replaced by George Thomas on the hour mark.\n\nStar man:\n\nBen Stevenson showed plenty of quality and did his best on a bad night for the Sky Blues.",

George, a Princeton professor. It was published on the program\u2019s website on March 14, and over 600 professors, students, and college affiliates have signed the statement as of Sunday.\n\n\u201cThe pursuit of knowledge and the maintenance of a free and democratic society require the cultivation and practice of the virtues of intellectual humility, openness of mind, and, above all, love of truth,\u201d the statement reads.\u201cThat\u2019s why all of us should seek respectfully to engage with people who challenge our views. And we should oppose efforts to silence those with whom we disagree\u2014especially on college and university campuses,\u201d it continues.\n\nAlthough the statement does not mention any one institution or incident, its publication follows a recent highly-publicized confrontation between Middlebury College students and controversial social scientist Charles Murray. Student protesters repeatedly disupted Murray, who had been invited by a conservative student group, pulling fire alarms during his talk, throwing objects at his car when he left, and ultimately injuring a Middlebury professor accompanying Murray.\n\n\u201cIt is all-too-common these days for people to try to immunize from criticism opinions that happen to be dominant in their particular communities,\u201d the statement reads. \u201cSometimes this is done by questioning the motives and thus stigmatizing those who dissent from prevailing opinions; or by disrupting their presentations; or by demanding that they be excluded from campus or, if they have already been invited, disinvited.\u201d\n\nAfter leaving Harvard for nearly 14 years following a high-profile fight with then president Lawrence H.

A downtown building, however, suffered damage and residents had to be evacuated from the building's roof.\n\nMichael J. Harris, Sr., 46, of Barrett Street, faces arson, attempted assault and reckless endangerment counts, all felonies. If convicted of the most serious count he would face up to 25 years in state prison.\n\nHe is accused of setting fire to 53 N. Jay St. just after 5:30 a.m. Saturday by pouring an unknown type of fuel on the stairwell and floors and lighting it on fire, according to papers filed in court. He allegedly set the fire in a dispute with his wife.\n\nHarris is also accused of attempting to douse his wife with an unknown accelerant and light her on fire. The woman, who did not live at that address, was not injured, prosecutor Michael DeMatteo said. Police arrested Harris shortly afterward at his Barrett Street residence.\n\nSeveral tenants were home at the time of the fire and some were forced to go onto the roof to be rescued by the Fire Department.\n\nThe fire attack came about four hours after Harris accosted his wife at The Saw Mill tavern on South Avenue, grabbing her by the arm and shoulder in an attempt to remove her from the location, according to papers. The woman suffered bruising, scratches and pain.\n\nHarris was being held Monday at the Schenectady County Jail on $50,000 bail.\n\nThe incident came almost one week to the hour after police say Antonio Bargallo, 69, doused his wife Elizabeth Gonzalez, 48, with gasoline and set her on fire. Gonzalez died of her injuries and services were held for her Saturday. Bargallo remains in custody on murder and other charges.", 
        "body2": "Faculty pressed Dean of Undergraduate Education Jay M. Harris on a new policy that would alter course schedules and increase standard class length to 75 minutes at the Faculty meeting Tuesday.\n\nHarris presented a proposal for the revised schedule, which is designed to allow students to take consecutive classes on the College\u2019s Cambridge campus and forthcoming Allston campus, slated to open in 2020. The Faculty will be able to vote on the proposal at its next meeting in April.\n\nIn order to increase scheduling efficiency, Harris proposed a designated set of start times for courses with 15 minutes of passing in between classes on the same campus. This would eliminate the de facto seven minute grace period for class beginnings known as \u201cHarvard Time.\u201d\n\n\u201cI do want to remind you that in many ways our scheduling practices, most of them actually, date to 1891,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to FAS Dean Michael D. Smith, the Faculty Committee\u2014the Faculty\u2019s highest elected body\u2014unanimously approved the motion.\n\nAfter Harris\u2019s presentation, ten professors inquired about the composition of the proposal, asking questions on topics ranging from pedagogical concerns to worries about the technology used for scheduling.\n\nEnglish professor James Engell questioned how the proposed expanded class day\u2014with the bulk of classes occurring between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m. instead of the current 10 a.m. and 2 p.m\u2014would affect professors with morning commutes.\n\n\u201cThere may be a lot of faculty who don\u2019t want to teach at 9 a.m.,\u201d Engell said. \u201cIt\u2019s not an easy commute for people.\u201d\n\nEngell also said he worried athletes would see diminished choice in classes given the longer course length.\n\n\u201cStudents who are athletes who often have practices and commitments that begin at 2:30 or so,\u201d Engell said. \u201cThose students, it would seem, therefore have a reduced number of classes that they could attend.\u201d\n\nResponding to Engell, Harris said that many schools, including Stanford, begin classes at 8 a.m. and that athletic teams may have to adjust their practices to accommodate the proposed change.\n\n\u201cWe are after all an educational institution and our student-athletes are student-athletes,\u201d Harris said. \u201cWe will be working with all of them in different ways to think how they rethink elements of their practices to accommodate our mission.\u201d\n\nOther professors questioned Harris about the 75 minute class block and associated passing time, asking if existing classes would have to alter their length or if students would have too much passing time in if a professor did not use the entire 75 minutes.\n\nHarris said that as long as start times were uniform, class lengths could vary, and that the new schedule was designed to accommodate a variety of teaching styles. He said that the potential extra passing time would be a trade-off to achieve the schedule\u2019s larger goals.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying not to have random start times, which is what we have today,\u201d Smith said. \u201cIf you shorten the pass time, then those individuals who need the pass time are disadvantaged.\u201d\n\nNear Eastern Languages and Civilizations professor Shaye J.D. Cohen asked Harris which classes would be offered in Allston following the construction of the new campus. Smith replied that in the future, more departments and courses could follow SEAS across the river, and Harris specifically mentioned that certain freshman seminars could move to Allston.\n\nUniversity President Drew G. Faust ended discussion of the motion shortly after 5:00 p.m. and told Faculty that discussion will continue at April\u2019s meeting, when the Faculty could potentially approve the motion.\n\nGovernment professor Danielle S. Allen also presented an update on the Presidential Task Force on Inclusion and Belonging at the meeting. University President Drew G. Faust convened the committee in September to evaluate Harvard\u2019s efforts to create an inclusive environment. According to Allen, the committee is currently in a phase of \u201clearning and discovery\u201d and will present an official report in the spring of 2018.\n\n\u201cWe are not going to be making specific proposals on a school by school basis,\u201d Allen said. \u201cWe expect to be proposing recommendations that recognize the diversity of schools across campus.\u201d\n\nThe Faculty also approved the creation of a new Master\u2019s Program in Data Science, following a motion by Statistics Department Chair Neil Shephard. There was no opposition from the Faculty.\n\n\u2014Staff writer Joshua J. Florence can be reached at joshua.florence@thecrimson.com.

        "body1": "If you were hoping to see Chris Archer pitching for Team USA again in the World Baseball Classic, prepare for disappointment. The Tampa Bay Rays ace has been told that he will not be needed for the final round.\n\nChris Archer took the ball for Team USA during their opening match of the World Baseball Classic against Colombia. While he pitched well in that game, Archer had yet to return to the mound, as he was presumably being saved for the final round had the Americans advanced that far. So, following their victory on Saturday over the Dominican Republic to advance to the semifinals, it was expected that Archer would be returning.\n\nInstead, in a series of tweets, Archer stated that he would not be coming back to pitch for Team USA in the tournament. In what sounds like an odd situation, Archer said that he was given a message that he would not be needed, and that the decision was out of his hands. Instead, Team USA plans on using Tanner Roark and Marcus Stroman in the next two contests.\n\nThe decision to leave Archer at home is a bit puzzling. Roark had a solid season in 2016, but he was hammered in his previous outing in the WBC. In Team USA\u2019s loss to the Dominican Republic earlier in the tournament, Roark allowed three runs in 1.1 innings. In a do or die situation against Japan, Roark may not be the best option.\n\nIt is also surprising given how much Archer had been looking forward to pitching in the tournament. He had been vocal about his desire to be a part of the WBC, saying it had been a dream of his since being in high school back in 2006. Archer had also stated that he felt the tournament was important given the political climate in the country, and that the team had a chance to pull the country together.\n\nInstead, Archer will be just like the rest of us for the remainder of the tournament, watching from afar and hoping for the best. And if Roark does perform well against Japan tomorrow, and Team USA advances to the Finals, then it will prove to be the correct move.\n\nUnless that happens, the decision not to bring Chris Archer back to the World Baseball Classic will remain an odd choice.

        "body2": "March Madness is everywhere you look, so we here at Steel City Underground felt like getting in on the craze with a Steelers-inspired tournament all our own: Steelers Who Marched Us to Madness.\n\nThe concept is simple. Over a period of the last five seasons, there have been a number of additions the Steelers have made who came in with high expectations. Several of those additions ended as subtractions for one reason or another, leaving Pittsburgh after a disappointing run with the franchise.\n\nWe have compiled eight of those names into a March Madness-style tournament, with you, the fans, voting on who was the most disappointing acquisition who \u201cmarched us to madness\u201d.\n\nNote: realizing this could be a bit insensitive to the actual player discussed, we would like to remind everyone that the tournament only involves past players and you should only consider their time with the Steelers when voting or leaving comments. This is merely an entertainment exercise to gauge fan expectation versus how a player\u2019s tenure in Pittsburgh turned out, which may have been disappointing for any variety of reasons.\n\nLet\u2019s look at today\u2019s participant.\n\nFans instantly loathed the selection of Archer to the Steelers in the 2014 NFL Draft. It wasn\u2019t that Archer, a versatile all-purpose back in college was a bad player. It was assumed that the Steelers \u201creached\u201d for him in the third round. Running back wasn\u2019t a pressing need for Pittsburgh (they selected Le\u2019Veon Bell a year earlier) and several analysts felt that Archer could\u2019ve been taken in later rounds.\n\nThey also predicted that Dri was too small to handle the everyday rigors of the pros.\n\nRegardless, some surmised that Archer could be one of the hybrid players Todd Haley had been looking to fit into his offense. The team had previously tried out similar style backs such as LaRod Stephens-Howling and Chris Rainey to no avail. Archer could have potentially played in the backfield or lined up at wide receiver, in addition to returning kicks (a skill he excelled at in college).\n\nUnfortunately, Archer would also fail to find his footing in the league.\n\nIn two seasons with the Steelers, Archer would receive a grand total of 10 carries, all in the 2014 season. He would receive a single carry in the Steelers 2014 Wild Card Game against the Baltimore Ravens; one in which they would be without Le\u2019Veon Bell. The team instead chose to play practice squad player Josh Harris, and sign street free agent Ben Tate, over playing Archer.\n\nHe would appear in 12 games for the Steelers in 2014, fighting injuries which would limit his playing time. He would return all of nine kickoffs, and a single punt that season. In 2015, he would appear in eight games, returning 14 kicks.\n\nThe Steelers cut him in early November of 2015.\n\nWho\u2019s your pick?\n\nVote now for who you feel was more disappointing as a Steeler:",
