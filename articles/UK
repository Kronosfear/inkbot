The head coach also took aim at Poite, who was repeatedly asked about Italy\u2019s tactic by England players but could be heard informing Dylan Hartley and James Haskell: \u201cI\u2019m sorry; I\u2019m a referee, not a coach.\u201d Jones said: \u201cThe referee got flustered \u2013 I have never seen a referee lose his perspective of the game [like that].\u201d\n\nWorld Rugby\u2019s view however, is that the law was officiated correctly by Poite. The law states that a ruck is formed \u201cwhen one or more players from each team, who are on their feet, close around the ball on the ground\u201d. If no ruck is formed then there is no offside line.\n\nJones said after the match he expects the law to be changed to outlaw the tactic, encouraging the World Rugby chairman, Bill Beaumont, to take action while George Ford warned that the strategy could \u201ckill the game\u201d. The Italy head coach, Conor O\u2019Shea, who revealed he discussed the tactic with Poite during their pre-match meeting, issued a staunch defence of his game-plan however, but did say, \u201cWill the law change? Of course it will. But we were legal and we played to the law.\u201d\n\nThere is a formal World Rugby process via which the RFU could seek a clarification on the law, which in turn could result in the practice in effect being ended.\n\nA RFU spokesman said: \u201cThis type of issue is discussed \u2018in the round\u2019 with World Rugby, through the normal structures and meetings.

Hain said:\n\nAnd that is something welcomed by unionists as well, secure in the knowledge that there can be no change in the constitutional position without their consent. Above all it\u2019s a symbol of the normalisation of relations between the two parts of Ireland. The government disturbs that at everyone\u2019s great and grim peril. And those who maintain that because the prime minister said she does not want to return to a hard border then it won\u2019t happen, should be aware that the Irish government \u2013 which doesn\u2019t want a hard border either \u2013 has nevertheless, as a contingency measure, begun identifying possible locations for checkpoints along the border with Northern Ireland in the event of a hard Brexit. I don\u2019t say that we\u2019ll go back to the murder and mayhem of the Troubles, but I do insist that the process could so easily unravel. If the referendum means Brexit at any price, it may well be at a dangerously high cost for the Northern Ireland peace process.",

        "body2": "The Arkansas Supreme Court on Thursday struck down a city's ordinance banning discrimination based on a person's sexual orientation or gender identity, but it stopped short of saying whether a state law aimed at prohibiting such local LGBT protections is constitutional.\n\nThe justices reversed a judge's decision that Fayetteville's anti-discrimination ordinance didn't violate a state law prohibiting cities from enacting protections not covered by state law. Fayetteville, a liberal enclave in northwestern Arkansas, is one of several cities that approved local protections for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people in response to the 2015 law.\n\nArkansas' civil rights law doesn't cover sexual orientation or gender identity. In the unanimous ruling, justices rejected the argument that Fayetteville and other cities that have enacted such ordinances have made that the protections are covered elsewhere in state law.\n\nThe court ruled that these other laws, included an anti-bullying law, aren't related to anti-discrimination laws and don't create new protected classes. They noted that the 2015 law states its intent to have uniform anti-discrimination measures in the state.\n\n\"[Fayetteville's ordinance] violates the plain wording of Act 137 by extending discrimination laws in the city of Fayetteville to include two classifications not previously included under state law,\" the court said. \"This necessarily creates a nonuniform nondiscrimination law and obligation in the city of Fayetteville that does not exist under state law.\"\n\nThe justices said they couldn't rule on the law's constitutionality since it wasn't addressed by the lower court, and sent the case back to the Washington County judge who upheld Fayetteville's ordinance. Attorney General Leslie Rutledge's office had asked the court to uphold the state law.\n\nA spokesman for Rutledge and Fayetteville's attorney didn't immediately return calls seeking comment.",

The collection\u2019s reported high price tags have left Supreme\u2019s original base of skaters nonplussed, with many exclaiming that they feel \u201cexploited\u201d in seeing their tribal garb fed through the luxury assembly line.\n\nAccording to streetwear blogs, it\u2019s expected that a skateboard carrier from the collection \u2014 sold with skate deck and accessories included \u2014 will be priced at $54,500. Louis Vuitton did not offer comment on the estimated price.\n\nWWD rode the D train down to the Lower East Side, and spoke with a gamut of skaters \u2014 at an LES skate park, skate shop and skate bar.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s stupid as s\u2013t,\u201d an anonymous thirtysomething skater said of the collection at the Lower East Side watering hole, Forgtmenot. Most skaters who spoke with WWD requested anonymity for fear of retaliation from Supreme employees \u2014 a downtown tribe deeply rooted in lower Manhattan\u2019s social scene.\n\nA burly creative in Carhartt overalls also felt disenchanted by the Supreme-Vuitton collaboration. \u201cIt solidifies Supreme\u2019s place in fashion, which is so stupid. They started the brand as a f\u2013k you to fashion, and now they\u2019ve become it,\u201d he said, stationed at Forgtmenot.\n\n\u201cThey represent the worst form of street culture,\u201d another thirtysomething skater said of Supreme, which received a cease and desist letter from Louis Vuitton in 2000 after it screen printed the luxury brand\u2019s monogram onto skate decks without authorization. \u201cWhen you go into the store, it\u2019s full of a\u2013holes, they vibe you out.\u201d\n\nSome went as far as to call the collaboration \u201ca betrayal.\u201d\n\nhbd stefen. good job A post shared by DAISY TOM (@daisyanntom) on Dec 4, 2016 at 4:35pm PST\n\nSupreme was started as a skater label. The brand\u2019s web site states its original intentions: \u201cIn April 1994, Supreme opened its doors on Lafayette Street in downtown Manhattan and became the home of New York City skate culture.\n\n\u201cSupreme grew to be the embodiment of the downtown culture\u2026Skaters, punks, hip-hop heads \u2014 the counter counter culture at large \u2014 all gravitated towards Supreme.\u201d\n\nAccording to skaters, this is no longer the case. \u201cIt orbits skate; it\u2019s not really on the planet,\u201d one said of the brand\u2019s standing among the skate community.\n\nIn the mid-Nineties, the brand\u2019s original Lafayette Street store employed an array of New York-famous youths \u2014 many of whom had cameos in Larry Clark\u2019s film \u201cKids.\u201d\n\nIn the time since, the brand\u2019s streetwear cachet has boomed \u2014 becoming a favorite of \u201cvery rare\u201d seeking collectors. Earlier this month, it was rumored that LVMH Mo\u00ebt Hennessy Louis Vuitton was in the process of acquiring Supreme for $500 million \u2014 chatter that was ultimately dispelled.\n\nAt the boutique Unique Hype on Elizabeth Street \u2014 which flips Supreme rare editions \u2014 a Parsons student said the Louis Vuitton collaboration will drive a deeper chasm between Supreme\u2019s skate base and collecting community.\n\n\u201cPeople are saying it\u2019s going to separate the men from the boys. Also change and divide the audience,\u201d said the student, who rifled through $560 sweatshirts hanging on the store\u2019s shelves.\n\nMultiple skaters told WWD that in the wake of its cachet-laden expansion, Supreme has diverged from its skate roots.\n\nIn visiting the Coleman Skatepark under the Manhattan Bridge, many teenagers expressed upset for the Supreme-Louis Vuitton collection, but were spotted wearing Supreme.\n\n\u201cIf you buy that Louis Vuitton s\u2013t, you\u2019re stupid,\u201d said one teenager.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s overly Hypebeast,\u201d said another teenaged skater \u2014 referencing the derogatory term for a male covered in head-to-toe, trendy streetwear, who lacks personal taste. The colloquialism takes its name from a popular streetwear blog.\n\nBut older skaters \u2014 who own and operate businesses in the Lower East Side \u2014 reckoned the collection\u2019s financial opportunity. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem to be the work of the designer [Nicolas Ghesqui\u00e8re], it seems like the work of the president \u2014 looking to make their next Murakami,\u201d said the skater. \u201cI\u2019m not too concerned with everything else going on in the world,\u201d he added.\n\nAnother older skater \u2014 a onetime frequenter of the shuttered Autumn skate shop \u2014 said the Vuitton collaboration could be the byproduct of current media culture. \u201cEverything is bigger and bigger, you have to be loud to pull off your next stunt,\u201d he said.\n\nLouis Vuitton declined to comment on skaters\u2019 claims of appropriation. But in a rare break with company culture, Supreme issued the following statement: \u201cThroughout the history of the brand, we\u2019ve seen our customers have apprehensions whenever we do something unexpected. However, we have always stayed true to the culture from which we came.\u201d",
