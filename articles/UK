        "PSG dominated Barcelona on Tuesday in the Champions League Round of 16 first leg, as Angel Di Maria scored twice in a 4-0 victory.

Barcelona didn't look anything like its normal, dangerous, world class self as PSG outclassed the visitors with a very high and aggressive press, time and time again and took a 2-0 lead into the break.\n\nBarcelona were stripped of their usual dominance of possession and did not have a reaction for it as PSG got more and more comfortable as the game wore on.\n\nPSG threatened a handful of times against an uninspired Barca defense, and it was Di Maria who got things going with a brilliant free kick goal on 18 minutes.\n\nBirthday boy Angel Di Maria spreads the love on #Valentines Day with this free kick goal vs Barcelona. üíôüíô #UCLhttps://t.co/jd7y1BqG8h ‚Äî FOX Soccer (@FOXSoccer) February 14, 2017\n\nJulian Draxler then made it 2-0 late in the first half with a fine strike on the right side of the box, leaving Barcelona stunned.\n\nJulian Draxler this season:\n\n\n\n0 goals in 14 matches for Wolfsburg.\n\n5 goals in 9 matches for PSG. üò≥ #PSGFCB#UCLhttps://t.co/ETnEg8z6QC ‚Äî FOX Soccer (@FOXSoccer) February 14, 2017\n\nIf it weren't for Barca goalkeeper Marc-Andre Ter Stegen, it could have been 3-0 or 4-0 at the half, but PSG still entered the break with an impressive lead.\n\nSecond half\n\nIt was more of the same.

        "Live UEFA Champions League: Edinson Cavani has pushed PSG further into dream land. (Source: Reuters) Live UEFA Champions League: Edinson Cavani has pushed PSG further into dream land. (Source: Reuters)\n\n‚ÄúWhat just happened?‚Äù is what everyone except PSG fans watching this match would have been thinking. PSG may be a team that could rival Barcelona in the transfer market but they were never considered equal to the Catalan giants on the pitch. Today, they have absolutely smashed that notion out of the park.\n\nThe birthday boys Edinson Cavani and Angel Di Maria are on the score sheet alongwith Julian Draxler, making his Champions League debut with PSG. Another standout performer has been 21-year-old French full back Adrien Rabiot who, alongwith Marco Verratti managed to keep a lid on the fabled Barcelona mid field.\n\nIf any team can score at least four goals in 90 minutes to win a match, it is Barcelona and that is exactly what they will need to do when they host their conquerors at the Nou Camp. They have turned around a two-goal deficit earlier in 2013 when they won the return leg 4-2. That was against an AC Milan side that was slowly dipping in stature in Europe. This is against a resurgent PSG.\n\n0005 hrs IST: The UEFA Champions League is back and off with a cracker. On one hand PSG host Catalan giants Barcelona. Barca have recently found a resurgence in their league form chiefly due to their fabulous ‚ÄòMSN‚Äô trio‚Äôs contributions up front. Coupled with a formidable defensive line led by Gerard Pique, Barca will be looking to show that they are the dominant side even when up against the cash rich Paris St. Germain, who themselves have seen a spike in their domestic form.\n\nBorrusia Dortmund have had a two-faced season. On one hand, they will have to be content with fighting for Champions League spots in the Bundesliga after dropping out of the title race long time back. On the other, they have been enjoying a scintillating run in Europe so far and have entered the Round of 16 as winners of their group ahead of Real Madrid.\n\n0045 hrs IST: Team News, Barca XI: Ter Stegen, Piqu√©, Busquets, Iniesta, Su√°rez, Messi, Neymar, Alba, S. Roberto, A.

Andres Iniesta is the man with the armband for Barcelona and Blaise Matuidi leads PSG.\n\n0117 hrs IST: At Lisbon, Benfica and Dortmund have kicked off with Benfica earning an early corner. It comes to nothing and Dortmund broke away with a quick counter. It seemed like they would make it count but Benfica managed to clear the final shot taken by Aubameyang\n\n0120 hrs IST: Barcelona had a free kick that was swung into the box by Lionel Messi. Busquets was the target but PSG managed to clear it and broke away with he counter. They had outnumbered Barca in their own half and Andre Ter Stegen did some intelligent sweeping job for the Catalans.\n\n0122 hrs IST: PSG are dominating play and Edinson Cavani had probably the best chance of the match. Julian Draxler lofted the ball to Cavani who came in behind Sergi Roberto. The Uruguayan was offside but the flag stayed down. Roberto then held his ground and blocked the shot.\n\n0125 hrs IST: At Lisbon, Dortmund took the ball from Benfica at a dangerous part of the pitch. Aubameyang was unmarked and had ample space through the middle and received the ball but in the end skied the shot.\n\n0130 hrs IST: That was another good chance for PSG when Matuidi managed to get into a relatively empty Barca box from the left. He took the shot and it would have gone in had it not been for a sensational one-handed save from Andre Ter Stegen. PSG have Barca on the ropes\n\n0133 hrs IST: Neymar seems to have a niggle. Meanwhile Julian Draxler is brought down just outside the box Umtiti. It‚Äôs taken by Di Maria and he SCORES! A beautiful free kick that was curled behind the wall and Ter Stegen who has done a fine job so far, stood no chance. PSG are leading Barcelona and it is an indication of how the match has gone thus far. They have pulled ahead in the 17th minute.\n\n0139 hrs IST: The first real opening that Barca had. Neymar avoids a challenge that came on him and ran into space towards the centre. He then found Andre Gomes who got in behind the PSG defence line and was in the clear. He couldn‚Äôt keep the shot away from the keeper.\n\n0148 hrs IST: 30 mins have gone by and it‚Äôs PSG 1-0 Barcelona. The home side have been the dominant team as the scoreline shows. Barca have just started to get the ball into the good areas with Neymar being their best player in attack so far. But overall, Barca have been saved from being embarassed in this first half hour by Andre Ter Stegen.\n\n0156 hrs IST: GOAL!! Julian Draxler scores in the 39th minute. They have been devastating on the counter with Draxler and Di Maria using their pace to catch out the Barca defence. Both of them are now on the score card. Draxler has already scored his fifth goal since his move, but this one has to be the special one for him.\n\n0201 hrs IST: That‚Äôs half time!! PSG lead Barca by two goals to none. It has been a first half that few would have expected would pan out in this manner but it has. Only Neymar has been able to do anything meaningful with the ball as both Messi and Suarez have been pretty much anonymous in this first half. Can Luis Enrique inspire his side into performing the way we know them to in the second half?\n\n0207 hrs IST: At Lisbon, its goalless at half time but that doesn‚Äôt tell the story of the match. Dortmund have been dominant and Pierre Emerick Aubameyang has had some very good chances thus far.\n\n0217 hrs IST: The teams have come out. PSG have a spring in their steps while Barca have scowls on their faces. Barca immediately give away a free kick. Its not come to anything but the visitors had to do some more nervous defensive work before the danger was gone.\n\n0222 hrs IST: Benfica have score in Lisbon, the home side have been dominant since the second half began and have been rewarded with a goal. Mitroglou is the man with the goal in the 48th minute. He headed in a lose ball that came off the keeper‚Äôs gloves from a free kick into the empty net.\n\n0227 hrs IST: GOAL!! Di Maria (54‚Ä≤), an absolute belter!! PSG are not letting go of it and are pummeling the Barcelona defence. Di Maria got the ball some way outside the box at the end of another quick counter attack. He went for it and it curl into the top half of the net. Di Maria is reminding Barcelona what they used to face in El Clasico‚Äôs\n\n0233 hrs IST: Angel Di Maria goes off to a standing ovation. The Argentine has scored two stunners to put PSG ahead and the man to replace him is Brazilian Lucas.\n\n0241 hrs IST: Marco Verratti has come off for PSG as the midfielder had went down. Unai Emery does not take any chances and replaces him immediately. Verratti has been instrumental so far in keeping Iniesta and Messi at bay.\n\n0243 hrs IST: GOAL!! Edinson Cavani (72‚Ä≤). Another counter attack and Cavan manages to get the ball with Pique, for a change unable to get to him in time. Cavani almost caressed the ball to Ter Stegen‚Äôs left and it goes into goal. This is turning out to be a dream night for PSG and a Parisian nightmare for the Catalan giants, who are now facing a real possibility of a Round of 16 exit from the Champions League.\n\n0253 hrs IST: Barcelona‚Äôs attacking super powers have been completely undone. It has been a rare lacklustre performance from Messi who is now trying to work something out for Barcelona. They had the best chance of the match when Messi curled in a corner, Pique headed it to Umtiti whose header hit the cross bar. Just a reminder to PSG that they are facing Barcelona after all.\n\n0258 hrs IST: The Parc des Princes rises once again as Julian Draxler is taken off. The German has had a dream European debut with PSG and is replaced by Javier Pastore.\n\n0301 hrs IST: In Lisbon, Benfica have managed to maintain their one goal despite the number of chances Dortmund have had. This includes a penalty from Pierre Emerick Aubameyang that was saved by the home team goalkeeper.\n\n0303 hrs IST: Barcelona got a free kick from just outside, almost from where Di Maria scored the first goal in the first half. Neymar was the man who took it and was unable to emulate the Argentine and hits it over. It has not been Barca‚Äôs night.\n\n0306 hrs IST: It has ended and the score is, believe it or not, Paris St. Germain 4-0 Barcelona. The full time whistle also goes off at Lisbon with Benfica managing to hold off Borrusia Dortmund to win the first leg 1-0.\n\n¬© The Indian Express Online Media Pvt Ltd",

        "As the Champions League returns, let us consider one of elite European football's most persistent mysteries. More appalling than The Dabgrave Ritual, more controversial than The Salto Vampire. We refer, of course, to the Adventure of the Two Strikers.\n\nOver the last few years, in Paris, two forwards have been playing their trade. One is, frankly, a buffoon. He clanks around up front like a man who grew up believing that football was a game about missing the goal, has only just been informed of his mistake, and is losing the battle against his ingrained instincts. Sometimes the ball goes in, generally out of embarrassment. Mostly, he just looks confused, while his teammates shake their heads, the game slips away, and the word \"fraud\" gallops around the internet.\n\nThe other is pretty much a case study in how to do one's job. Whether we simply count his goals, or look to the more complex metrics such as xG (R^E, L7, eN variant)*, we find the same results. When played in his right position with decent support, he gets on the end of plenty of chances and he puts an acceptable proportion of them away. In short, he is extremely unfraudulent.\n\n* Expected goals, adjusted for the rotation of the earth, the moon's presence in the seventh house, and El Ni√±o.\n\nThe mystery is that both these players play for Paris Saint-Germain in the same position, at the same time, wearing the same numbered shirt and the same face. And are the same person: Edinson Cavani.\n\nThe internet isn't big enough to get to the bottom of the argument between those people who like to watch football with their eyes, and those people who distrust their lying eyes and like to watch football with their spreadsheets. But there are few footballers for whom the fraud/non-fraud argument is felt quite so sharply. And, as PSG's owners pursue the Champions League trophy that would validate their entire project, there are few for whom it's so important.\n\nLast November's Champions League game against Arsenal provided the perfect illustration of the problem. It is deeply unfortunate that a striker gets remembered for his misses in a game where he scored the opening goal, one that ultimately made the difference between a draw and a defeat. But Cavani missed four clear chances that night and, come the end of the group stage, PSG finished two points behind Arsenal. That's why they've landed Barcelona in the knockout stages; that's why Cavani will likely have to score plenty over the two legs.\n\n(The fact that Arsenal went on to draw Bayern Munich is irrelevant here, because when it comes to Champions League knockout draws Arsenal are cursed, whereas PSG are simply unlucky.)\n\nWhat makes the suggestions of fraudulence even sharper is the fact that Cavani, for a given value of perfect, looks perfect. Long hair, broad shoulders, cheekbones that should probably be illegal: He looks like an attempt to construct a footballing superhero from the ground up. \"Give me a brilliant, charismatic, intimidating striker who could also kill an elephant if he absolutely had to.\" So when this vision of footballing perfection misses a chance? It looks unshakably wrong.\n\nPerhaps this is where we can find the solution to our mystery. Cavani's heroic aspect comes with certain responsibilities. Strikers in his mold should express themselves through their shoulders, their sinews, and their sweat. They should howitzer their goals into the net from about 20 yards out, then whip their hair around and scream for the replays. Not all footballers can be Gabriel Batistuta; even the great man himself resorted to the occasional toe poke. But those that have the look simply must give it a go.\n\nThe fraud committed by Cavani isn't the usual combination of being (a) famous, (b) expensive, and (c) extremely well-paid while also being (d) secretly rubbish. Instead, it's one of presentation, of expectations. Though he has his spectacular moments, he spends most of his time playing a game antithetical to his bearing. He gets into clever positions, he moves intelligently off the ball, he peels away from defenders. All good stuff, all admirable. But all somehow inappropriate, from a man whose bearing promises to take on and overcome the laws of physics.\n\nSometimes he tucks away his chances, sometimes he doesn't. Either way, we the viewers are largely left bereft. Yet ultimately, he's the real victim here, the butt of some great cosmic joke. They took a striker who looks like the lovechild of Batistuta and Conan The Barbarian, and they made him play like Andy Cole. No wonder people get so angry.",

        "The Ukip leader, Paul Nuttall, is facing more questions about Hillsborough after being forced to admit that claims on his website about losing close friends in the disaster were false.\n\nIn an interview with Liverpool‚Äôs Radio City News on Tuesday, it was put to him that in 2012 he said on his website that he had ‚Äúlost close personal friends‚Äù. Nuttall denied making the claim.\n\nWhen the presenter, Dave Easson, who was at Hillsborough on the day of the disaster, showed him the evidence that the claim had been made on his website, Nuttall replied: ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt lost a close, personal friend. I‚Äôve lost someone who I know.‚Äù\n\nHillsborough families dismayed by Paul Nuttall's 'insulting' admission Read more\n\nNuttall then suggested that he was not responsible for the statement, saying: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry about that, but that is something ‚Ä¶ I haven‚Äôt put that out. That is wrong.‚Äù\n\n\n\nThe admission comes four days after the Guardian reported that Nuttall had denied lying about being at Hillsborough on the day of the 1989 disaster.\n\n\n\nOn Monday, when asked about the claim that he had not been at Hillsborough, Nuttall said: ‚ÄúI feel bloody angry, angrier than I‚Äôve ever been and I thought I had seen everything in politics.‚Äù\n\nHe said he believed he was a victim of a smear campaign orchestrated by the Labour party. ‚ÄúI know it‚Äôs a dirty game, but this is beyond scraping the barrel to be perfectly honest with you. It‚Äôs upset me personally, it‚Äôs upset my family.‚Äù\n\nRadio City Talk (@RadioCityTalk) UKIP leader Paul Nuttall admits that claims on his website that he lost a \"close personal friend\" at Hillsborough are false pic.twitter.com/bnNKm29IsU\n\nOn Tuesday, Nuttall told the radio show he had been at Hillsborough and described claims to the contrary as cruel. ‚ÄúI was there on that day. I have witnesses, people who will stand up in court and back me up 100%.‚Äù\n\nThe revelation that he had not lost close friends at Hillsborough brought an angry reaction from relatives of those who died. Margaret Aspinall, the chair of the Hillsborough Family Support Group, whose 18-year-old son James died in the disaster, described the admission as ‚Äúappalling‚Äù.\n\nShe has previously questioned why Nuttall, an MEP for almost eight years, had never offered to support the families‚Äô campaign to challenge the police cover-up and to win justice.\n\nIt also prompted a number of MPs to denounce Nuttall, with Tim Farron, the Liberal Democrat leader, saying: ‚ÄúIt is sad to see a tragic event like Hillsborough being dragged into politics in this way. Paul Nuttall‚Äôs blatant untruths have caught up with him. I‚Äôm sure voters in Stoke will punish him as a result.‚Äù\n\nBen Howlett, the Tory MP for Bath, described the admission as ‚Äúsickening‚Äù, while Karl Turner, Labour MP for Hull East, branded it ‚Äúshocking‚Äù. Chi Onwurah, a shadow business minister, said: ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt think my opinion of Ukip‚Äôs leadership could get any lower, then I saw this.‚Äù\n\nOthers questioned whether Nuttall could be believed on other issues. Tom Blenkinsop, another Labour MP, said if the leader of Ukip was ‚Äúprepared to lie about this, for a very prolonged period of time ‚Ä¶ what else would he lie to the British public about?‚Äù\n\nNuttall was 12 at the time of the disaster and was a pupil at Savio high school in Bootle. One of his former teachers, a Roman Catholic priest, has told the Guardian that the school believed it had been aware of the identities of every boy who had been at Hillsborough in order to help them through a difficult period, and that Nuttall was not among them.\n\n\n\nA fellow pupil at the school who says he has been a friend of Nuttall for decades said the Ukip leader had never mentioned being there. ‚ÄúI have been very good friends with Paul for over 25 years,‚Äù he said, adding that during that time they had ‚Äúnever spoken‚Äù about Hillsborough.\n\nJoe Benton, who was Labour MP for Bootle for 25 years, said that to the best of his knowledge Nuttall had not mentioned Hillsborough when he stood against him as Ukip‚Äôs candidate in the 2005 and 2010 general elections.\n\n\n\nNuttall had not mentioned being present at Hillsborough during any public meeting they had both attended, nor in his campaign literature, Benton said, despite the strength of feeling within the constituency about the police negligence that led to the deaths and the subsequent official cover-up that led to Liverpool fans being blamed for the disaster.\n\nWhen confronted with the evidence during the interview on Radio City in Liverpool, Nuttall said he had no idea why his personal website was carrying the false claim. A few hours later, in an interview with BBC Radio Merseyside, he said a Ukip press officer was to blame, adding that it was the same press officer he has previously said was responsible for asserting, on his personal website, that he had been a professional footballer.\n\nIn a statement on Tuesday night Nuttall said: ‚ÄúThis was an article that I did not write and did not see prior to is being posted by a member of my staff.‚Äù\n\nShortly after the two interviews, Nuttall‚Äôs website underwent comprehensive changes, with every reference to his having lost close friends at Hillsborough disappearing.\n\n\n\nStaffordshire police have said they are investigating an allegation of election fraud after Nuttall‚Äôs nomination papers for the Stoke Central byelection gave an address in the city at which he subsequently admitted he was not living.

Neither team will win the Champions League, but...\n\n...the winner of the tie will certainly cause problems for whoever they face in the quarter-finals.\n\nThe pace was frantic in the early stages and both sides caused problems for each other with nippy runs between the defenders.\n\nNelson Semedo and Eduardo Silva looked a deadly partnership down the right for Benfica, while Dortmund's creative forward line of Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, Marco Reus, Ousmane Dembele and Raphael Guerreiro look capable of changing a game at any moment.\n\nYou do feel that both sides are missing a little bit of star quality to go all the way - but they can most definitely scare one of the big guns.\n\n(Photo: Lars Baron)\n\n2. Aubameyang firing blanks\n\nHe might be one of the most sought-after strikers in the world, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang looked a man devoid of confidence.\n\nDortmund came into the fixture after only winning two of their previous eight games, with their talismanic striker only scoring twice since the start of December.\n\nHe had the perfect chance to return to form when Ousmane Dembele played him one-on-one in the first-half, only to rocket the ball over the crossbar. He then had the opportunity to tap into an open net, but he was a yard short of latching onto the cutback.\n\n(Photo: Lars Baron)\n\nAnd at the start of the second period, he lifted another one-on-one over the crossbar.\n\nWhat did he possibly need for a confidence boost? A penalty, of course. He missed that too. Straight down the middle but Ederson saw it coming and stayed put.\n\nHe was substituted off in the 62nd minute to compound the misery on a night to forget.\n\n(Photo: Alexandre Simoes)\n\n3. Fifth officials under fire again\n\nWe all know the phrase 'too many cooks spoil the broth'.\n\nWell, perhaps this was the problem when the fifth official, situated on the goal line, failed to collaborate with the referee and the linesman to give the most simple foul of the night.\n\nOusmane Dembele charged through on goal and Benfica goalkeeper Ederson raced out, only for his attempted clearance of the ball to completely miss, resulting in him wiping out the Frenchman on the edge of the box.\n\nThe official behind the goal was about 15 yards from the incident, a similar position to the linesman. Whose call should it be? Either way, Benfica got away with one.\n\n(Photo: Lars Baron)\n\n4. Remember Fulham's Mitroglou? He's pretty good now\n\nLet's all be perfectly honest, here. Kostas Mitroglou was bloomin' awful during his time at Fulham.\n\nHe is considered by most as one of the biggest flops in the history of the January transfer window, with the Cottagers paying a club-record ¬£12million for his services. They didn't get a single goal from him.\n\nSo looking at the 28-year-old now, you would barely believe that it is the same man banging them in for Benfica in the Champions League.\n\nA smart run, bags of composure and a deft touch saw him open the scoring for the hosts.\n\nEven more remarkably, it was his 13th goal in his last 13 matches. Not too shabby.\n\n(Photo: Lars Baron)\n\n5. Wigan are setting their sights high\n\nYes, Wigan Athletic. Our Wigan. The pie-lovers from the outskirts of Greater Manchester.\n\nThe scout list from Estadio da Luz had a few interesting names on it. As expected, the likes of Manchester United, Chelsea, Juventus and Bayern Munich were included... as were Wigan Athletic.\n\nWhile staring relegation from the Championship in the face, you have to question which players they are possibly looking at in a Champions League fixture.\n\nAnother interesting note from the list is that United legend Ryan Giggs is down as UEFA's technical observer.

        "In the rarefied world of the Champions League there is a fine line between being a serious force and a serial joke. Arsenal know this and so do Paris Saint-Germain, who host Barcelona on Tuesday in the first leg of what almost amounts to a face-saving mission for the club and for their manager, Unai Emery. There is more than a place in the quarter-finals at stake.\n\nEmery has been in his job only since June last year but he needs his team to topple Barcelona to deflect doubts about his coaching and the French club‚Äôs method and mettle. This time last year PSG thought they had established themselves as bona fide European giants by beating Chelsea home and away but criticism and mockery for the oil-powered club returned with a vengeance when they flopped in the next round against Manchester City. PSG‚Äôs chief executive officer, Nasser al-Khelaifi, described it as the lowest point of his reign.\n\nBordeaux are being held back by perseverance with J√©r√©my M√©nez Read more\n\nSince being boosted in 2011 by the Qatari government‚Äôs investment authority, PSG have won nine major trophies in France, including the past four Ligue 1 titles, but never made it beyond the quarter-finals of the Champions League. By comparison, Chelsea finished as semi-finalists three times and runners-up once in the first five years after Roman Abramovich decided to become their fairy godfather. Chelsea went on to win the trophy (in 2012), whereas PSG got the feeling after the defeat last year by City they were going backwards. ‚ÄúThis was the first time I‚Äôve had the feeling of failure, not because we lost in the quarter-finals again but because of the manner of the defeat,‚Äù Khelaifi said before announcing there would be ‚Äúmajor changes‚Äù. The tie against Barcelona will give the strongest indication of how well those changes are working.\n\nThe changes were on three levels. Emery replaced Laurent Blanc as manager, Patrick Kluivert was hired as director of football and there was a turnover of players, with Zlatan Ibrahimovic and David Luiz among the departures and several players arriving ‚Äì four in the summer and another three in January. Over the past month there have been hints that those changes are bearing fruit but there is still a sense everything could turn sour for a club at a critical stage of their growth.\n\nPSG have won 10 of their past 11 matches but the one they failed to win was the most important, January‚Äôs 1-1 home draw with Monaco, who remain on course to seize PSG‚Äôs domestic crown, three points clear of them at the top of Ligue 1. The injury-time equaliser PSG conceded to Monaco was the latest evidence that when push comes to shove, this PSG team tend to stumble. Finishing below Arsenal in the Champions League group stage, despite outplaying Ars√®ne Wenger‚Äôs team twice, was also damning.\n\nPSG‚Äôs wealth does not buy more time for Emery. Au contraire. The Spaniard has altered PSG‚Äôs style but not yet as much as he would have liked. Senior players such as Thiago Silva and Maxwell met the manager after an embarrassing defeat at Toulouse in September and discussed moderating the pace of change. The upshot is that PSG have had a hybrid feel, as if they are trying to play Emery‚Äôs style but in Blanc‚Äôs formation. That suggests Emery does not quite have all the players he wants, although January appeared to bring a degree of clarification about recruitment, with Kluivert seemingly emerging as more influential than Olivier L√©tang, the sporting director.\n\nJulian Draxler was the key January signing and, despite his drab form at Wolfburg before his arrival, he has made such an impact that he is practically guaranteed to start against Barcelona. The question is where? The sense is Emery would like to deploy him just behind Edinson Cavani in a 4-2-3-1 but the problem is that many of the players the manager inherited still seem morecomfortable in a flatter 4-3-3, which entails sticking Draxler out wide and reducing creativity.\n\nThe fact that Thiago Motta is suspended for the first leg against Barcelona and Blaise Matuidi has seemed on the decline for most of the season may convince the manager to impose his more adventurous instincts.\n\nIt is certainly a plus that Marco Verratti made a strong return from injury in the victory at Bordeaux on Friday but, even with the ingenious Italian, PSG need more creative players in the middle, especially as Javier Pastore‚Äôs match fitness is uncertain after another couple of months out injured. Giving Draxler a central position enables PSG to station Lucas Moura and √Ångel Di Mar√≠a on the wings, an option that looks all the more attractive since Di Mar√≠a‚Äôs recent upswing in form. That would be a daring ploy, even more so if Emery followed it through by selecting his most aggressive full-backs, Serge Aurier and Layvin Kurzawa, as opposed to the more stable Thomas Meunier and Maxwell.\n\nEmery also has a big decision to make in goal ‚Äì and the fact that Alphonse Areola and Kevin Trapp have been faulty this season may convince the manager that trying to outgun Barcelona is the safest policy. All the more so if reports are true that the captain and leader of PSG‚Äôs defence, Thiago Silva, has been ruled out after suffering an injury in training.\n\nWhich brings us inevitably to Cavani. Emery may lament, a little like Pep Guardiola with Sergio Ag√ºero, that the striker does not fit into a holistic plan as readily as the manager might wish and is, therefore, not a worthy heir to Ibrahimovic‚Äôs Parisian throne. And Cavani is still liable to squander chances ‚Äì but despite those beefs he is in the deadliest form of his career. His two superb volleys on Friday took his tally to 33 goals from 31 matches this season and put him on course to beat the record set last term by Ibrahimovic.\n\nCavani had to wait until his club entered a transitional period to gain the role he craved. Now he could spearhead a thrilling way forward for Paris. Or the club could be knocked out and make another punchline.",

        "Catherine Ivill - AMA/Getty Images\n\nArsenal forward Lucas Perez is reportedly considering his future at the Emirates Stadium due to his lack of playing time.\n\nAccording to Adam Crafton of the Daily Mail, despite only joining the club from Deportivo La Coruna in the summer, the Spaniard has grown frustrated at being on the fringes with the Gunners.\n\n\"Kieran Gibbs, [Alex] Oxlade-Chamberlain and on-loan Jack Wilshere are all still waiting for talks about contract extensions, with their own deals up next summer,\" noted Crafton. \"Perez will also consider moving on if he does not get regular football.\"\n\nPerez's concerns are understandable, as he has only started two Premier League games since his arrival.\n\nHe's featured more frequently in the cup competitions, and as noted by World Soccer Talk's Chris Moore, when he has been on the field, typically he's made a positive impression:\n\nFor most teams, those sorts of numbers would be enough to force a way into manager Arsene Wenger's plans. However, Arsenal are blessed with plenty of quality in the forward positions, with the likes of Alexis Sanchez, Theo Walcott, Olivier Giroud and Danny Welbeck all battling for a spot in the XI.\n\nCompetition for places is fierce at Arsenal. Julian Finney/Getty Images\n\nPerez would have still been expecting to feature a little more frequently. Granted, he has suffered with some injury issues since signing, but given his versatility and industry, it was anticipated there would be more situations in which he would be utilised for the Gunners.\n\nThat'll be a concern for the player, and with that in mind, it's little surprise he's already pondering a possible move. For most clubs in the Premier League and across Europe, he'd be a key man, and while the Gunners may be better placed to challenge for trophies than most, at 28, Perez will want to show what he can do on a more regular basis.\n\nAdrien Rabiot Discusses Contract Negotiations\n\nJean Catuffe/Getty Images\n\nParis Saint-Germain starlet and reported Arsenal target Adrien Rabiot has insisted he is in no hurry to agree an extension with his current club.\n\n\"Very honestly, I do not want to think about that,\" he said to Le Figaro (h/t TalkSport) of a new contract. \"I am under contract until 2019, it is not urgent.\"\n\nThe 21-year-old continued: \"I would prefer to stay concentrated on football. We will have to talk about this again at the end of the season. The club is aware. They are trying to protect themselves, extend as many players as possible and I understand that. I know that they are counting on me a lot, that I am one of the young players that could form the core for the future.\"\n\nAs noted by TalkSport, the Gunners have long been linked with a move for Rabiot, with manager Wenger said to be a big admirer. Here's why he's rated so highly:\n\nWith players like Marco Verratti, Blaise Matuidi, Thiago Motta and Grzegorz Krychowiak at PSG, competition is fierce in the midfield spots. But Rabiot continues to get minutes at the Parc des Princes, starting 11 games in Ligue 1 this term.\n\nIndeed, Bleacher Report's Jonathan Johnson believes the youngster should be starting matches for the team:\n\nWith that in mind, PSG would no doubt be keen to secure an extension for Rabiot. He's proven he can be a big asset for Unai Emery; his poise, passing ability and tenacity out of possession make him a superb option to call upon in midfield.\n\nThey are qualities that would have undoubtedly impressed those at Arsenal, and Rabiot would potentially be a wonderful acquisition. However, his contract would have to run a lot closer to expiry before PSG considered any sale.", 
        "Angel Di Maria celebrates one of his two goals against Barcelona. (Getty Images)\n\nA brace from Angel Di Maria and goals from Julian Draxler and Edinson Cavani saw PSG to a 4-0 Champions League demolition of Barcelona.\n\nPSG were knocked out of the competition by Barcelona in 2013 and 2015 but Luis Enrique's side now require a comeback unprecedented in Champions League history having been put to the sword in the French capital.\n\nDi Maria, celebrating his 29th birthday, dispatched a free-kick that rewarded PSG's dominant start and Unai Emery's men never relinquished their grip on the first leg of the last-16 tie.\n\nFormer Sevilla boss Emery had only beaten Barcelona once in 23 previous attempts but he was well on his way to number two when Julian Draxler scored on his Champions League debut for PSG, as he did in Ligue 1 and the Coupe de France last month.\n\nThe visitors completely failed to regroup at the break and a sublime third from Di Maria's magical left foot was followed by Edinson Cavani's 32nd of the season in the 71st minute ‚Äì capping a night of almost incomprehensible misery for their esteemed opponents.\n\nDi Maria was to the fore in the early stages, setting up top scorer Cavani to have an attempt blocked by Barcelona full-back Sergi Roberto, while Marc-Andre ter Stegen demonstrated his sharp reactions and athleticism to save from Blaise Matuidi.\n\nThe hosts made their fast start tell in the 18th minute when, after Samuel Umtiti clattered through Draxler on the edge of the area, Di Maria whipped a fine free-kick beyond a disorganised wall to leave Ter Stegen with no chance.\n\nBefore the half-hour, Neymar shrugged off an earlier blow to his foot by gliding forward from his own half and playing in Andre Gomes, who forced Kevin Trapp to save with his feet.\n\nBarcelona's first sustained spell of pressure only served to leave them vulnerable on the counter-attack - Germany winger Draxler skipping past Roberto to be denied by his compatriot Ter Stegen at the near post.\n\nAnd Lionel Messi found himself in the unusual position of being to blame for an opposition goal five minutes before the interval.\n\nThe irrepressible Adrien Rabiot hounded him out of possession with the assistance of Marco Verratti and the Italy midfielder twice exchanged possession with Draxler for PSG's showpiece January arrival to arrow home a low shot.\n\nHalf-time did little to clear Barcelona's heads as Rabiot made a nuisance of himself once more, springing onto a second ball and into a crowded area to clip a shot past the far post.\n\nCavani had to wait for his 32nd of the season when he failed to head in Matuidi's centre but it mattered little as Di Maria brought a raucous Parc des Princes to its feet in the 55th minute.\n\nThe move started with goalkeeper Trapp feeding Rabiot, who drove at Barcelona once more.\n\nA combination of Rabiot and left-back Layvin Kurzawa allowed Draxler to tear at a beleaguered defence. He fed Di Maria and, as Andres Iniesta flailed in the challenge, the Argentina star curled in a sumptuous strike from 25 yards.\n\nDi Maria departed to a standing ovation after the hour, although the brilliant but injury prone Verratti did not enjoy such a satisfying end to his evening when he hobbled off in discomfort with 20 minutes to play.\n\nHowever, the last thing Barcelona needed was fresh PSG legs and they laboured as Thomas Meunier strode forward unchallenged, playing in Cavani to emphatically slam past Ter Stegen.\n\nUmtiti headed against the post in the 83rd minute but Barcelona were unable to move beyond base camp of the mountain they must somehow attempt to scale in next month's return at Camp Nou.",
