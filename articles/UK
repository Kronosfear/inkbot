Network  DIFFERENT  Deadly  Alien  We ve found 220 planets capable of sustaining life  Most are nothing like our own  Their stars are strange  Their weather is upside down   Does this make us the alien freaks   Astronomers have been busily scanning the skies for life giving worlds since the 1990s  But it was not until the Kepler space telescope cast its eye over a narrow band of our galaxy that we got to see simply how many planets there really are out there   Kepler alone has so far spotted 4000 of them  The fact that 0 05 per cent of these sit in orbits warm enough for liquid water has enormous implications for the existence of life   But the real eye opener is where most of these worlds are   Most don t orbit yellow stars like our own   Instead  we keep finding them around red dwarfs   These are the most abundant stars in our galaxy  making up some 75 per cent of the Milky Way   There s nothing particularly special about them   They re dim  They re ruddy  They re small   But everything from the colour of the sky  the behaviour of the winds and the shape of the seasons on the planets around them are unlike anything we have experienced  Their geography is also completely different to our own   All this would drive life in unexpected directions   It s an alternate reality that has set planetary scientists and exobiologists scrabbling to model and comprehend   So far the odds appear loaded against life evolving around red dwarfs  But science is still at the stage of figuring out how many dice there are   This isn t easy given how utterly alien these planets are   But  given the sheer number of red dwarf stars in our galaxy  the chances are life will have gotten off the ground somewhere   And the discovery of seven Earth like worlds around the red dwarf star TRAPPIST 1   with six of them capable of holding water   adds new weight to the dice   GIVER OF LIFE  The  thing  about red dwarf stars like TRAPPIST 1 is their temperature   They re not as hot as our Sun  But they live a lot longer    You have to be really very close in order for your planet to have temperatures on the surface like those we have on Earth   says associate professor in Space Science Graziella Caprarelli of the University of South Australia   The closer you have a planet to a star  the more problems you may encounter  Solar flares  for example    Life is a game of numbers   Dr Caprarelli says   So you can be unlucky one day and you die  but your species may also be somewhere else so it survives  So events like solar flares in that context probably won t do much damage  Once life is established  it s established    The biggest hurdle life faces under a red dwarf is its weak light   Its radiation is also most intense at different wavelengths than we get from the Sun  Peak output   where it is the most intense  where you get the most photons   is in the infra red range  From our Sun  the peak intensity is in the blue green range   So what would a world be like in the infra red    If there is water on the planet  then water absorbs the infra red radiation quite strongly   Dr Caprarelli says   This water will be warmed up a lot  Much more than it is on Earth  So if the water is so much hotter  you can expect much more evaporation    Which brings us to the heart of the matter  Clouds   Once clouds have formed a planet can trap an atmosphere underneath  Their presence also helps keep life giving water liquid    It is something that would work in favour of producing habitable planets around red dwarfs   she says   EXPLORING A NEW WORLD  One particular characteristic will drive the shape of worlds orbiting stars like TRAPPIST 1  tidal lock   These planets will have their spin gradually slowed over the course of a billion years  Eventually  they simply stop   Essentially  the sun never rises or sets  It remains fixed at one point in the sky   There is no day and night  Just one or the other   and many shades of red between   It s something that has severe implications for climate and life  Exactly what remains uncertain  But science is attempting to extrapolate   The dark side of a water rich planet is almost certainly going to be one vast network of tightly packed glaciers and fields of ice   The sunward side would be searing hot   It s the transitional edge between the two which is most likely to be  just right    It s a twilight zone   It s called the  terminator   the boundary between night and day  Perpetual dusk  Eternal dawn   It s also likely an environment of contrasts  In the shadows  ice  In the sunlight  dust  In between  life giving liquid water   Such water would create a potential  ring of life    Conditions could range from steamy tropical swamps through to frigid ponds   all within a few hundred kilometres  Each sub climate would be an almost permanent band encircling the entire planet  On Earth  of course  our seasons change as the planet wobbles in its spin   But Dr Caprarelli says there is one major consequence of liquid water that could broaden a red dwarf world s habitability  Weather   There s likely to be lots of it as hot air and evaporating water directly beneath the red sun rises   sucking cooler air in from below and depositing heat and moisture deep on the dark side    It comes back to the clouds   Dr Caprarelli says    Because it has just one side facing the sun  the planet will have temperature gradients  Because of these temperature gradients  it will generate very strong winds  And because of the winds  clouds would be redistributed around the planet in a more or less uniform way    The outcome  More evenly balanced temperatures   The fleshy body of this 'plant' is mostly underground  save for the spectacular rosette of petals that trap moisture and  with the aid of symbiotic microbes  harness sunlight  While the mature organism is immobile and unthinking  its wind blown seeds possess the limited degree of self awareness necessary to navigate it to a site suitable for germination    Dr Brian Choo  OF A DIFFERENT MOULD  Some speculate that red dwarf worlds would be dead  with all their water permanently locked away in ice  Whatever portion had faced their star would have boiled away into steam  only to fall as snow once it wafted over the dusk line   Others believe there is much more to the geology of these worlds than that   Dr Caprarelli suspects most red dwarf planets face a fate like Venus  with runaway greenhouse effects generated by excessive evaporation    But the beauty of red dwarfs is that there are so many of them   Dr Caprarelli says    Statistically  somewhere a red dwarf might have a planet that had all of the right conditions at the same time so that life can emerge and evolve    A variety of landscapes would likely be carved out by such geological processes  These would then gradually erode under the influence of wind and rain   Under a blanket of clouds  enormous glaciers near the rim of perpetual night and day could gradually be melted by the warm air circulating in from the sunward face  Some may even slip into the sunlight  Such glaciers would probably be sitting on sheets of liquid water   produced purely by the friction of their immense weight   Vein like valleys left from ancient geological activity could funnel this water deep into the sunward face  kept largely chilled by the permanent shadows cast by cliffs and eroded river banks   Another mitigating factor for life would be that these planets will not have always been tidal locked  Dr Caprarelli says   For their first billion years or so  they would have spun  This would give them internal friction  heating up their cores  Such geothermal activity would power a magnetosphere to protect the planet from flares   Combined  these elements could produce an environment in which microorganisms could evolve   With the right roll of the dice  these could then develop to harness the energy of their weak stars  she says  If they can do this by the time their planet grinds to a halt  life will have become well entrenched   Such a planet would be primed for evolution   This odd creature grazes on low growing lichen like vegetation and digs for buried tubers  The low slung body and armoured carapace permit it to forage during the blistering windstorms that scour surface  The paddle like tail and vestigial fins betray an aquatic larval stage in the cool lakes at the edge of the melting dark zone glaciers    Dr Brian Choo  EYE OF THE BEHOLDER  Earth like evolution requires billions of years  Notably  red dwarfs live much longer than our own yellow star   But time is not enough  You need the right physical conditions  On top of that  life needs to thrive for it to become dominant enough for advanced evolution to begin to apply   Even the slightest variation in just one element could reshape such a world  A few degrees here  a little less water there   whether or not microbes emit C02   could tip the balance away from supporting advanced life and into a runaway greenhouse effect   Dr Caprarelli s vision is for a thriving red dwarf world is one covered in oceans   Whatever the world  she says  the more water  the stronger the pulse of life   Advanced life only exploded on Earth when photosynthesising vegetation started colonising the land  The simple change in the planet s surface colour   along with the gases the plants emitted   went on to influence temperatures  Essentially  they terraformed the Earth for themselves   Under a red dwarf  it would need to be something different    On a planet where the radiation coming from its star is mostly skewed towards the infra red  then this microorganism wouldn t have enough photons to run the metabolic processes that require energy   Dr Caprarelli says   Therefore it would need to adapt to being able to absorb all of the wavelengths that fall on it  Will it be able to do it  I think maybe yes  but it s another challenge life there would have to face    This would involve plants being very dark  even black  Animals would need transluscent skin    Where life is involved  everything is possible   Dr Caprarelli says   Whether it is probable is another story    BLINK  Then there are those astrophysicists and planetary scientists who reject the concept of tidal locked Goldilocks planets altogether   This could mean more red dwarf worlds could be habitable than expected   Some argue the mere presence of an atmosphere would be enough to impel a planet s rotation  This  in turn  would drive a magnetic field and weather systems similar to our own   Such a magnetic field would act as a life giving shield  improving the chances of a red dwarf planet holding an atmosphere in place and allowing life to develop on the surface below   Auroras could often extend across the entire sky  Though cataclysmic mass extinctions would still be an occasional occurrence   But somewhere  some creature may have already looked up from its refuge into the glowing  ruddy sky and wondered    Is there life out there   Reporting  Jamie Seidel   Artwork  Steven Grice   Animation  Steven Grice    Red dwarf climate  University of South

        "body0": "Wonderful potentially habitable worlds around TRAPPIST 1  Posted by Franck Marchis  22 02 2017 12 00 CST  Topics  extrasolar planets  This post originally appeared on Franck Marchis' Cosmic Diary blog and is reposted here with his permission   In May 2016  Michael Gillon and his team announced the discovery of three Earth sized exoplanets around TRAPPIST 1  an ultra cool M dwarf star  using the small TRAPPIST telescope at ESO La Silla  Chile  It was an exciting discovery yet on that day no one could possibly have imagined that less than a year later they would make another significant discovery involving the same system  But here we are  today  they announced in Nature the discovery of seven potentially habitable Earth like worlds   NASA   JPL Caltech The TRAPPIST 1 system  Where might liquid water exist  This representation of the Trappist 1 system shows which planets could harbor liquid water  The inner three planets are likely too hot  and the outer planet is probably too cold  but the middle three planets might be just right  This representation of the Trappist 1 system shows which planets could harbor liquid water  The inner three planets are likely too hot  and the outer planet is probably too cold  but the middle three planets might be just right   The star  named TRAPPIST 1  is a fairly inconspicuous star in our Milky Way  Small  8  the mass of the sun  and cold  half the temperature of the sun   it is a member of an ultra cool dwarf population that represents 15  of the star population of our galaxy  In 2016  Gillon and his team detected the transit  i e   the shadow of a planet passing between its host star and us  of three exoplanets at the inner edge of the habitable zone of their star   Energized and excited by this discovery  the team requested and received additional telescope time to follow up on this system during the second half of 2016  The NASA Spitzer telescope is one of the facilities they selected for an ambitious program that called for monitoring the TRAPPIST 1 system almost continuously for twenty days  Spitzer and other ground based telescopes allowed the team to detect thirty four transits  more than they had anticipated  suggesting the existence of additional exoplanets in the system   After an careful analysis  the data revealed the presence of seven Earth sized exoplanets  named TRAPPIST 1b  c  d  e  f  g  and h  in orbit around this M type star  Because their orbital periods are short  less than twelve days for planets b to g   several transits were detected during the campaign  Accurately measurements of those tiny events  0 6  dimming of the star  provide a wealth of information about the planets  orbits  sizes  and even masses by measuring precisely the timings of the transits which are perturbed by the gravity of other planets   F  Marchis   H  Marchis Trappist 1 top view Top view of the Trappist 1 planetary system showing the circular orbits of the seven Earth like exoplanets

Mercury orbits at 0 39 AU from our sun  This is NOT equivalent to our solar system  but more a minuscule version of it  comparable in size mass ratio to Jupiter and its Galilean Moons     the most

version of it  comparable in size mass ratio to Jupiter and its Galilean Moons  Similar to our solar system  these exoplanets travel circular orbits all of which go in the same direction  They probably formed more than 500 million years ago together with their star     all of which go in the same direction  They probably formed more than 500 million years ago together with their star  The depth of the transits provides a measurement of the radius of the planets   which are similar to Earth  b  c  e  f  g  or Mars  d  h  so they range from 75  to 110  the size of Earth       which are similar to Earth  b  c  e  f  g  or Mars  d  h  so they range from 75  to 110  the size of Earth  The data are accurate enough to detect mutual gravitational effects  so we can infer the mass of the first six planets   and hence their density  Those are rocky worlds that range in density from 60 and 117  that of Earth       and hence their density  Those are rocky worlds that range in density from 60 and 117  that of Earth  Considering the amount of energy they receive from the star  these planets might have a temperature suitable for the presence of liquid water on their surface  e f g

Trappist 1  and their radiuses  For comparison  the incident flux of Mercury  Mars and Ceres  as well as the locations of Venus and Mars are added  Trappist 1d receives the same amount energy as Earth   What can t we say about the TRAPPIST 1 system   This is not the first discovery of a system with this many exoplanets  HR8832 and HD10180 have seven planets that were discovered by radial velocity  In both cases  the exoplanets are massive  at least ten times the mass of Earth  The host stars also have a mass similar to our sun  Kepler 90 is another system with seven exoplanets discovered by transit measurements  Several of those exoplanets are larger than Earth and probably ice and gas giants  What is crucial here is that for the first time  we have discovered seven temperate rocky exoplanets in orbit around a M dwarf star  There are many such stars in our galaxy  so there are probably a lot of worlds like these out there     in orbit around a M dwarf star  There are many such stars in our galaxy  so there are probably a lot of worlds like these out there  No  we have not yet discovered a cousin of Earth  much less seven of them  The measurements provide interesting information about these exoplanets  and we can confidently say that six of them are rocky  However  their location in the habitable zone of their star does not imply that they are habitable  For instance  Mars and Venus are in the habitable zone of our Sun  but are not habitable anymore  In other words  it is too early to say if there are oceans on their surface  TRAPPIST 1 is located twenty nine light years from us  so we will probably need the large aperture of the JWST or a dedicated space telescope like ARIEL to detect the presence of an atmosphere and derive its composition  Using the Hubble Space Telescope  the team has tried to detect an exosphere on one of the planets but without success so far     No  we have not detected life on those exoworlds  In my opinion  life is the result of a complex cascade of random events  and we don t really know if those exoplanets  located near an ultra cool star  are suitable for life  They are very close to their star and may be tidally locked  showing the same hemisphere to their star at all times  The existence of life on worlds with temperatures that vary from one hemisphere to the other is difficult to imagine  It will take years of observations and modeling to understand if life can exit on such a strange worlds   NASA   JPL Caltech   F  Marchis The TRAPPIST 1 system Artist's representation of the Trappist 1 system with the

telescope  on steroids   made of four  1 meter robotic telescopes installed at Cerro Paranal  With this telescope  the team will survey 10 times more red dwarfs than TRAPPIST did  So we could expect the discovery of a dozen systems similar to this one soon  We will have the opportunity to explore the diversity of atmospheres and climates on Earth like worlds  and potentially life out there   The discovery of these strange new worlds where life could flourish is the beginning of an exciting time for astronomers and biologists  A time when we are beginning to see the unimaginable  a time when life as we don t know it can be imaged and studied  We will probably need to build complex and expensive instruments to understand those worlds but what an astonishing  awe inspiring  life changing

        "body0": "Ever since Nemanja Vidi  and Rio Ferdinand left Old Trafford  Manchester United didn't have a truly reliable and consistent center back and that was a major issue during Louis van Gaal's ill fated tenure  Chris Smalling had a pretty good 2015 16 season but is prone to episodes of carelessness  Marcos Rojo is at his best a useful CB and at his worst a torrid time for any supporter  Daley Blind works hard and has a pretty nice touch with the ball on his feet  but is not a CB  Phil Jones cannot stay healthy even if you pray to the Old Gods and the New   Then Eric Bertrand Bailly came to the scene and we were reminded of how good it was to have a highly talented defender to bail us out and give us balance  Sure  he s a bit edgy on some tackles and not the full product yet  but Bailly is a major improvement on a zone that was really in need of it  And he clogged Jamie Vardy in a wonderful manner against Leicester  which is always nice   Jos  Mourinho would likely want to sign another CB in the summer   probably a more experienced one considering that Bailly is  despite his great performances so far this season  only 22 years old  although the Victor Lindel f rumors in January might suggest that experience would not be Jos 's main concern   Regardless  this season is far from being finished and with United fighting on four fronts  it's important to have a clear idea of who should be the Ivorian's partner on the defense for the most important matches  So let's see the possible combinations   Eric Bailly and Chris Smalling  The one partnership Mourinho has been using the most these last few matches  Both Bailly and Smalling are very similar but yet so different on the same time  both are physically strong  both are tall  both have a pretty aggressive way of defending and both are pretty damn good in the air   So far  so good  so what   like Megadeth said  but  sadly  Smalling  bless him  can play well for 89 minutes of the match and the other minute would be causing a penalty  missing a key pass or doing any other shenanigan that may cause United to lose points  Newcastle away last season is still haunting yours truly    Granted  all CBs can make mistakes  even Maldini made mistakes at his peak  But Smalling is 27 years old now and it's not looking very likely he would grow from here  Add his bad passing to the equation and you have the potential for him to ruin a perfect defending job   the kind of defending that Mourinho likes  parking the bus  some call it    Eric Bailly and Marcos Rojo  Now  this particular aspect of The Busby Babe is going to admit he is not very fond of Marcos Rojo  While the former Estudiantes defender has been very decent so far this season  making a very solid partnership with Phil Jones during Bailly's month away with his national team  his propensity for late tackles and overall aggressive playing style might not fit too much with Bailly's already physical  and much more polished and developed  defending style   Eric Bailly and Axel Tuanzebe  A man can dream  right   Eric Bailly and Daley Blind  The partnership that started this season and the one that broke up after United's more than dubious display against Pep Guardiola's  A K A  The Philosopher  Manchester City side  And while Daley Blind  despite playing the position during his formative years at Ajax and last season under Louis van Gaal  is not a CB  he has proven to be useful in that role providing timing  good positioning and using his brilliant passing and vision to start attacks  considering that Mourinho's United is much more offensive than van Gaal's  this is a pretty good trait   The Bailly Blind binomial is one of the most enjoyable and offensive minded alternatives because of the reasons explained on the previous paragraph  it becomes a partnership set to start attacks because Bailly is not too shabby with the ball on his feet  either  They both complement very well also due to one's speed and physical prowess and the other's passing  timing and vision   Sadly  Blind's lack of size and speed makes him a very tempting for the Harry Kanes  Sergio Ag eros and  if we get Champions League football  the Robert Lewandowskis of the world  It's not this writer's criticism of Blind  it's last season proving that Blind perhaps is not the best option for every match  but definitely for some when the rival is sitting back   Eric Bailly and Phil Jones  Correct me if I'm wrong  but these two have never played together  right  I don't recall at the moment  Regardless  so much has been said about Phil Jones' constant injuries that we almost forget that he is  for better or worse  United's best CB after Bailly  We don't know if that's a good or a bad thing  much like the Trump presidency  But let's not go there   From my point of view  considering United's current options  this is the most reliable partnership if it weren't for Jones' fitness issues  The former Blackburn man is certainly no Mats Hummels with the ball on his feet  but he knows his limitations and makes some safe passes rather than losing possession  van Gaal must be so proud of him   He has a pretty good timing and  much like Bailly and his former teacher  Nemanja Vidi   he is not afraid of doing some savage tackles or putting his head where others wouldn't even think of doing it  do I need to remind you that glorious tackle against Giroud     The downside of this partnership is the inability of one of his halves to stay healthy and that could be Phil Jones' downfall as a footballer at the long term  not being able to surpass these injury issues  But he is still only 24  We don't know how  but he is still only freaking 24   Eric Bailly and Timothy Fosu Mensah  If Timbo gets to be developed as a CB  this partnership has the potential to be much cooler and effective than the entire The Dark Tower series  But Mourinho has been using the Dutchman as a right back and as a midfielder  so it's not looking very likely   Marcos Rojo and Phil Jones  TO HELL WITH ERIC BAILLY    Who does he think he is  taking the spotlight in this article  You know what  Eric  We don't need you  We won nine matches in a row with Rojo and Jones as our CBs  so they must be the solution  right  RIGHT    How do you like that  ERIC    Anyway  we'll leave it to you because the fans are always right  that's what Arsenal Fan TV taught us over the years   Who do you think should partner Eric Bailly in United's defense ",

        "body0": "Cressida Dick will be the next commissioner of the Metropolitan police  it has been announced   She will be the first woman to lead the Met  Dick  56  now works at the Foreign Office and was formerly the Met s head of counter terrorism     The choice was made on Wednesday after candidates who had applied for the role of Britain s top police officer were interviewed by a panel that included the home secretary  Amber Rudd  and London s Labour mayor  Sadiq Khan   Guns  money and sins of the past confront new Met commissioner Read more  The home secretary made the final decision but by law had to take into account the views of the London mayor   Dick said she was  thrilled and humbled  by her appointment  which shattered a glass ceiling as old as the Met itself  She said   This is a great responsibility and an amazing opportunity  I m looking forward immensely to protecting and serving the people of London and working again with the fabulous women and men of the Met  Thank you so much to everyone who has taught me and supported me along the way    Dick s rise to the top of policing comes despite the controversy around her role in the 2005 operation in which an innocent man  Jean Charles de Menezes  was shot dead by police who mistook him for a suicide bomber  A jury at a criminal trial in 2007 exonerated her of any personal blame  but some thought her role in the incident could block her becoming leader of the Met   A statement issued on Wednesday on behalf of the De Menezes family by his cousin Patricia Armani said   We have serious concerns about the appointment   At the helm of the police on that fateful day when Jean was killed was Cressida Dick  The message of today s appointment is that police officers can act with impunity      The Met is Britain s biggest force  accounting for about a quarter of spending on policing in England and Wales  It was founded in 1829 and as well as covering London it has national functions including counter terrorism  and diplomatic and VIP protection   The new commissioner replaces Sir Bernard Hogan Howe  the first Met commissioner since 2005 to complete a full five year term in office  Before him  Sir Ian Blair and Sir Paul Stephenson had both resigned mid term after being dogged by controversy   The new commissioner faces a tightening financial climate  some crime types rising and the challenge of keeping the capital safe from a severe and enduring threat   Dick was born  brought up and went to school in Oxford  and studied at university there  at Balliol College  For a short time she worked at an accountancy firm before joining the Met in 1983 as a constable in the West End   In 1995 she transferred to the Thames Valley force where she continued her rise through the ranks  returning to Scotland Yard in 2001 with a master s degree in criminology   Her reputation as a reformer was forged in the Met s diversity directorate  formed after the Stephen Lawrence inquiry had damned the force as institutionally racist  She became known as a brilliant operational leader  cool under the most extreme pressure  when she led Operation Trident  the unit policing gun crime  particularly within the black community   De Menezes family call for Cressida Dick to be barred from leading Met Read more  She became an assistant commissioner in 2009  and after two years with the Met embroiled in scandal  she was promoted to one of the top roles in policing  as head of counter terrorism   Friends said Dick loved that job  but her relationship with Hogan Howe became strained  She was moved out of the role  in a thinly veiled slapdown  and then started looking to leave the Met   She applied to lead the Police Service of Northern Ireland  but was unsuccessful  and then landed a director general role at the Foreign Office  first as a secondment before she formally left the Met  Now as commissioner she will have to be sworn in again as a police officer  taking the oath to the Queen and vowing to uphold the law without fear or favour     Rudd said   Cressida Dick is an exceptional leader  and has a clear vision for the future of the Metropolitan police and an understanding of the diverse range of communities it serves   my recommendation  follows  a rigorous recruitment process which highlighted the quality of senior policing in this country    She now takes on one of the most demanding  high profile and important jobs in UK policing  against the backdrop of a heightened terror alert and evolving threats from fraud and cybercrime  The challenges ahead include protecting the most vulnerable  including victims of sexual abuse and domestic violence    Cressida s skills and insight will ensure the Metropolitan police adapt to the changing patterns of crime in the 21st century and continue to keep communities safe across London and the UK    Rudd added   Cressida is absolutely the right choice to lead the Metropolitan police as this government continues its work to reform the police  and I look forward to working with her to make a real difference to policing in the capital      Khan said   Cressida Dick will be the first female commissioner of the Met in its 187 year history  and the most powerful police officer in the land  She has already had a long and distinguished career  and her experience and ability has shone throughout this process    This is a historic day for London and a proud day for me as mayor  The Metropolitan police do an incredible job  working hard with enormous dedication every single day to keep Londoners safe  so for me it was absolutely essential that we found the best possible person to take the Met forward over the coming years and I am confident that we have succeeded    Dick s appointment means five of the top posts in the criminal justice system in England and Wales are now held by women  Lynne Owens is director general of the National Crime Agency  seen as a rival to the Met for prestige  Owens sat on the first interview panel for the Met commissioner s job and would herself have been seen as a favourite if she had not earlier opted for the top job at the NCA   The other women leading the justice system are Alison Saunders at the Crown Prosecution Service  Rudd  and Sara Thornton  who is chair of the National Police Chiefs Council  who was beaten by Dick to the commissioner s post   The appointment is by royal warrant and is usually for a five year term  which can be extended   Dick was chosen from a field of candidates including Mark Rowley  a Met assistant commissioner who leads on counter terrorism across British policing  and Stephen Kavanagh  chief constable of Essex police  an ex Met veteran ", 
        "body2": "Sir Bernard Hogan Howe has robustly defended his record as Met Commissioner  insisting he does not regret the way his force handled the disastrous investigation into VIP sex abuse allegations   In his final public speech before retiring later this month  Sir Bernard said his five and a half years as Commissioner had been spent in a  restless search for ways to stay ahead of criminals    He said under his leadership  Scotland Yard had adopted the values of  courage  compassion and integrity  and had championed the needs of the weak and vulnerable without fear or favour   But his time as Britain's most senior police officer has also been dogged by controversy  including widespread criticism over Operation Midland   the Met's flawed historic sex abuse probe  which saw the reputations of a string of VIPs traduced by an alleged fantasist   The Met is now facing possible multi million pound legal action from former Tory MP  Harvey Proctor  broadcaster Paul Gambaccini and the former head of the army  Lord Bramall  who were all falsely accused of child abuse   Despite this Sir Bernard told an audience at the Royal United Services Institute  RUSI   that if he had his time again  the one thing he would have done differently would have been to roll out a new crime fighting IT initiative sooner ",
