        "body1": "Mr Connaire invented the font for Microsoft in 1994, basing it on lettering in DC Comics graphic novels Watchmen and Dark Knight Returns.\n\nHe decided that it was more suitable for a Microsoft program called Microsoft Bob, which was designed to make computers child friendly, but which was using Times New Roman as a font at the time.\n\nThe typographer said he couldn't believe how upset people around the globe got over the typeface - with a group called Ban Comic Sans, which says the font is \"silly\" and is like \"showing up for a black tie event in a clown costume\", even set up.", 
        "body0": "Vincent Connare, typographer\n\nI was working for Microsoft\u2019s typography team, which had a lot of dealings with people from applications like Publisher, Creative Writer and Encarta. They wanted all kinds of fonts \u2013 a lot of them strange and childlike. One program was called Microsoft Bob, which was designed to make computers more accessible to children. I booted it up and out walked this cartoon dog, talking with a speech bubble in Times New Roman. Dogs don\u2019t talk in Times New Roman! Conceptually, it made no sense.\n\n\n\nSo I had an idea to make a comic-style text and started looking at Watchmen and Dark Knight Returns, graphic novels where the hand lettering was like a typeface. I could have scanned it in and copied the lettering, but that was unethical. Instead, I looked at various letters and tried to mimic them on screen. There were no sketches or studies \u2013 it was just me drawing with a mouse, deleting whatever was wrong.\n\nI didn\u2019t have to make straight lines, I didn\u2019t have to make things look right, and that\u2019s what I found fun. I was breaking the typography rules. My boss Robert Norton, whose mother Mary Norton wrote The Borrowers, said the \u201cp\u201d and \u201cq\u201d should mirror each other perfectly. I said: \u201cNo, it\u2019s supposed to be wrong!\u201d There were a lot of problems like that at Microsoft, a lot of fights, though not physical ones.\n\nComic Sans was developed too late for Microsoft Bob, but our office administrators started using it a lot in emails \u2013 mostly young women whose jobs were to make everything fun. They did birthday parties, organised events, and Comic Sans fitted with their cheery messages. As it became more well-known, it was eventually included in Windows 95.\n\nI started to see it everywhere \u2013 and then the backlash began. A group called Ban Comic Sans was formed to educate people about the uses of typefaces, though they did email me to ask if it was OK to set it up. It seemed silly, but I said knock yourselves out. Though that backlash has calmed down, except on Twitter. People who come up to me are more likely to say they love it.\n\n\n\nType should do exactly what it\u2019s intended to do. That\u2019s why I\u2019m proud of Comic Sans. It was for novice computer users and it succeeded with that market. People use it inappropriately: if they don\u2019t understand how type works, it won\u2019t have any power or meaning to them. I once heard a guy at a Rothko show say: \u201cI could have done that.\u201d He clearly doesn\u2019t know anything about art. He\u2019ll probably use Comic Sans without realising it\u2019s wrong in certain circumstances.\n\nI\u2019ve only ever used Comic Sans once. I was having trouble changing my broadband to Sky so wrote them a letter in Comic Sans, saying how disappointed I was. I got a \u00a310 refund. In those cases, I would recommend it. The basic theory is that typography should not shout \u2013 but Comic Sans shouts.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018They announced the Higgs boson in Comic Sans \u2013 that was inappropriate.\u2019 Photograph: Cern\n\nTom Stevens, program manager, Microsoft\n\nMy job was to match products to fonts, sort of like a marriage broker. Comic Sans was designed for Microsoft Bob, which in many ways was a precursor to Cortana or Siri \u2013 for people who had problems with computers. A woman called Melinda French was helping to head it up. I wasn\u2019t well connected and had no idea she was dating Bill Gates and would end up marrying him.\n\nThe magic is that people took to it on their own, rather than via any Microsoft marketing. It does get misused, usually because somebody just loves it. Things like the slideshow at Cern, where they announced the Higgs boson in Comic Sans, that was inappropriate. But the fact that people have the freedom to say, \u201cThis is my favourite font and I\u2019m going to use it\u201d is a marvellous thing. The backlash, the level of hatred, was just amazing \u2013 and quite frankly funny. I couldn\u2019t believe people could be so worked up over something as simple as a font.\n\nIt\u2019s almost an anti-technology typeface: very casual, very welcoming. It\u2019s like going home, back to your childhood, getting letters from family members. Or somebody might use it to get away from the staid environment of their work. When you use Comic Sans, you\u2019re making a statement: \u201cI\u2019m more relaxed, more creative. I may be working in this area, but this job does not define me.\u201d",

Former shadow business secretary Clive Lewis has also written to the advisory committee on business appointments (Acoba), saying the committee should rebuke Osborne for accepting the post before he had written to the committee for guidance.\n\nAcoba assesses any private paid roles taken by former ministers and civil servants in fields they used to regulate in government, but although it can offer guidance, it cannot prevent appointments. Its advice has historically included guidance to delay appointments, which it cannot do if the appointment has already been announced.\n\nOsborne has previously been rebuked by Acoba for announcing his Northern Powerhouse initiative before seeking the committee\u2019s advice, and is likely to be similarly criticised by the watchdog for publicly announcing his newspaper job having only informed the committee earlier this week.",

This then needs to hooked up to a phone or tablet via Bluetooth, and Square's free Point of Sale app download.\n\nSquare charges a fee of 1.75 per cent for in-person payments, and 2.5 per cent for all other transactions such as online or by phone.\n\nA handful of small merchants in London have been trialling Square in the run-up to the launch, including Piano Bar in Soho and a florist in South London.\n\nGeorge Hudson, owner of Piano Bar Soho, said: \"Square has been a perfect fit for my business, allowing me to easily take card payments both at the table and at the door.\n\n\"It's intuitive for our staff to use with no training necessary, and the real-time sales data helps me keep track of how the business is doing, even when I'm in a remote location. I have always valued innovation and design in business, and I appreciate Square's focus on those important elements as well.\" \u00b5", 
        "body0": "Twitter Chief Executive Jack Dorsey told CNBC he will do \"whatever it takes\" to make sure the social media platform and his financial services business Square do well, amid continued calls for the tech founder to focus on one over the other.\n\nDorsey is the CEO of both Twitter and Square. He returned to Twitter as boss in 2015 after former CEO Dick Costolo stepped down.\n\nThe entrepreneur has been under pressure at Twitter recently because of fairly stagnant user growth and continued issues over the number of bots on the platform, which is estimated to be around 15 percent of the current 319 million monthly active user base.", 
        "body2": "After all these years, Jack Dorsey and Ev Williams are pretty much still in the same boat.\n\nThe two entrepreneurs, who co-founded Twitter in 2006, each announced plans this week related to subscription options for their respective struggling ventures.\n\nTwitter, where Dorsey is the current CEO, on Thursday confirmed that it is exploring a paid offering on its TweetDeck service that would provide its power users with more premium features. The service could charge users a reported $19.99 per month.\n\nMeanwhile Medium, where Williams is the CEO, on Thursday debuted its membership program offering that gives users exclusive content in exchange for $5 per month. The Medium paid service will also give users access to new features before non-paying users.\n\nBefore ousting each other from Twitter, Dorsey and Williams could rarely agree on what exactly the service was for or in which direction it should be taken. It's ironic, then, that the pair seem to have landed on the same solution at the same time for their respective problems.\n\nWe don't have figures for Medium as the company is private, but its subscription strategy comes after the company tried making money using branded content (read: advertisements). The plan didn't work out, and in January, Medium laid off 50 people, about a third of its staff. Medium, which is an elegantly designed service where anyone can post their writings, is hoping the subscription model will finally create a fruitful revenue stream for the not-so-young, 6-year-old startup.\n\nTwitter's advertising aches, on the other hand, are well-documented. Since Dorsey's return in mid-2015, Twitter has seen its advertising revenue growth vanish. In the second quarter of 2015, the company's ad business grew by a commendable 63 percent year-over-year. But since then, it's been on a steady decline, falling by 0.47 percent in the most recent quarter. This is not unrelated to Twitter's inability to attract new users as well as an increasingly competitive digital and social media marketing marketplace (read: Snapchat).\n\nIt remains to be seen just how well these subscription models will do. But as Dorsey and Williams each struggle to keep their companies afloat, perhaps the former pair of co-founders are not so different after all.",

Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email\n\nIf you thought that speakers were just for listening to music, it's time to think again.\n\nA new battleground has emerged in the war for the \"smart home\". Web-connected speakers that not only play music but offer helpful information and obey spoken commands are jostling for a place in your living room.\n\nAt the end of last year, Amazon finally released its Echo speaker in the UK - over a year after launching the device in the US.\n\nEcho comes with an integrated voice assistant called Alexa that can answer questions, make to-do lists, set alarms and provide weather, traffic and other information in real-time.\n\nNow Google is preparing to launch its rival device, called Google Home, with its own voice assistant that can perform many of the same tasks.\n\n(Photo: REUTERS/Beck Diefenbach)\n\nSo how do the two devices stack up? And which one will win the battle for your heart, and your home?\n\nDesign\n\nAmazon Echo is a 23.5 cm tall cylindrical speaker with a diameter of 8.3cm. It is fairly heavy compared to other wireless speakers, and somewhat monolithic in appearance.\n\nThe bottom half of the device is covered by a speaker grille, while the top of Echo has a ring of light that you can turn to adjust volume, and buttons for mute and activation.\n\nThe speaker only comes in black and white colour options.\n\nBy contrast, Google Home is quite squat - with a shape supposedly inspired by wine glasses and candles.\n\nIt has a sloped top, with a touch-capacitive display and four coloured LED lights to provide visual feedback, and a single physical mute button on the back, which you can press to prevent Google from listening to \"hot words\".\n\nThe bottom of the unit is covered by a speaker grille and can be swapped out for different coloured shells to suit your personal taste. There are six shell options in fabric or metal.\n\nSound\n\nIf you're going to invest in a speaker, the most important thing is that it sounds good.\n\nAmazon Echo is a 1.0 channel speaker, meaning that it is a single speaker with one tweeter and one woofer. That's pretty basic considering that, for most people, playing music will be its primary function.\n\nMeanwhile, Google Home boasts a \"high-excursion driver\" with a \"dual passive radiator\" design that Google claims delivers \"crystal-clear highs and deep lows\". That means a lot of big sound from a small package.\n\nGoogle Home speakers can also be synced together, or used to control other speakers that have a Chromecast Audio device plugged into them, essentially creating a multi-room speaker system.\n\nVoice assistant\n\nAmazon's voice assistant Alexa is capable of understanding simple commands, or even a series of commands, but she can't conduct two-way conversations.\n\nAlexa's default search engine is Bing, meaning that responses to all the questions you ask will be derived form the Microsoft-owned search engine.\n\nYou have to phrase your questions in the right way to get the answers you want, but Amazon claims the more you use Echo, the more Alexa will adapt to your speech patterns, vocabulary and personal preferences.\n\nGoogle Assistant taps into the superior power of Google's search engine, allowing you to ask more complex questions in a more natural way.\n\nYou can also ask follow-up questions, so it feels more like a conversation.\n\nMoreover, the Assistant on Google Home is the same as the Assistant built into Android smartphones, so data can be shared across both devices.\n\nThe irritating thing about Google Assistant is that it doesn't have a name, so whereas you can wake up Amazon's assistant by just saying \"Alexa\", with Google Home you have to say \"OK Google\" every time you want to talk to it.\n\nCompatibility\n\nWhere Amazon Echo excels is in its compatibility with other apps.\n\nThe speaker already boasts Uber, Skyscanner, National Rail, and JustEat among its \"skills\", as well as several smart home appliances such as Hive, Netatmo and Philips Hue.\n\nIn fact, Amazon claims that more than 130 apps are supported by Amazon Echo and Alexa voice commands.\n\nGoogle Home can link up with Philips Hue, Nest, Samsung SmartThings and IFTTT - as well as its own Chromecast devices - but that's about it so far.\n\nBoth the Echo and Home are compatible with the most common music streaming services - most notably Spotify and TuneIn.\n\nWith the Echo, you can tap into Amazon's own music library and Prime Music offerings, while the Home links up with Google Play Music and YouTube Music.\n\nPrice and availability\n\nAmazon Echo echo went on sale in the UK on 28 September, at a price of \u00a3149.99. It is available at Argos, Currys, John Lewis, PC World, and Tesco, as well as from Amazon itself.\n\nGoogle Home is not yet available in the UK, but has gone on sale in the US for $129.\n\n(Photo: Reuters)\n\nEven if Google decides to convert that number into pounds when it crosses the pond, it will still be over \u00a320 cheaper than Amazon's rival.\n\nVerdict\n\nIn many aspects, Google Home seems to come out on top in the battle of the smart speakers. It's smaller, more customisable, and its voice assistant is powered by Google search, which many regard as superior to Bing.\n\nOn the other hand, it's early days for the device - no one in the UK has had a chance to put it through its paces yet, and it lacks the breadth of integrations with third party apps that Amazon Echo boasts.\n\nIf you're hungry to get your hands on a smart speaker in the UK now, your choice has already been made for you, as Google Home is currently only available in the US.\n\nHowever, if you're willing to hold out a little longer, you may find that Google Home has more to offer.", 
        "body0": "Launch of rival to Amazon Echo takes fight to Jeff Bezos\u2019s Seattle-based company, but experts say it\u2019s still Google\u2019s to lose\n\nGoogle is launching its rival to Amazon\u2019s Echo, the Google Home, in the UK as the battle for the living room hots up.\n\nThe smart speaker, which can play music, control Internet of Things devices, and answer questions, will cost British customers \u00a3129, \u00a320 less than Amazon\u2019s Echo, when it launches in Britain on 6 April.\n\nGoogle first launched the Home in the US in November, alongside the introduction of the Pixel phone and Google Assistant AI. Google Assistant is a voice-controlled digital assistant that runs on phones, Google Home and even smart TVs, and can provide context-aware assistance, knowing what sort of environment it\u2019s in.\n\n\n\nSince the initial launch, Google Assistant has gradually come to more Android phones, as well as Android Wear-based smartwatches. It is also integrated into Google Allo, one of the company\u2019s plethora of chat apps. But the Google Home device is the only smart speaker to feature Google\u2019s assistant.\n\nBy contrast, Alexa, the AI assistant built into the Echo, has been made available to any third-party licensee who wants to sign up, meaning that as well as the Echo family of products, there are now other smart speakers, cars and even washing machines with Alexa integration.\n\n\n\nGoogle and Amazon are shaping up for a long battle to dominate the field, but Amazon has a large first-mover advantage, according to Edison Investment Research\u2019s Richard Windsor, with 10m Echoes shipped compared to less than 1m Google Home devices.\n\nEven so, Windsor said: \u201cThe Google Home experience is so superior to Alexa that we still see a risk of Amazon losing this race.\u201d In response, Amazon has been reaching out to third-party developers, encouraging the creation of apps which work with Alexa but not Google Assistant.\n\nWindsor said: \u201cThe result is that very few of the smart home device developers are making sure that their devices work with Google Home, giving many users more reason go with Amazon\u2019s Echo devices rather than Google.\n\n\u201cAmazon is also very fortunate that the market\u2019s view of Alexa is so positive, as a side by side test of the Amazon Echo against Google Home shows how inferior Amazon is compared to Google,\u201d he said.\n\nWindsor added: \u201cThis is why it is still Google\u2019s battle to lose, but Amazon is clearly doing everything that it can to ensure that it is Alexa rather than Google that dominates the potentially extremely lucrative market for intelligent home automation.\u201d\n\nGoogle also announced its Google Wifi, its mesh system that aims to give consistently strong coverage, will come to the UK, also priced from \u00a3129, and launching on 6 April.",

        "body1": "FEARS are growing that the new Queensferry Crossing will not be ready by the revised completion date at the end of May.\n\nThe opening of the \u00a31.35 billion bridge over the Forth has already been postponed once. It had been due for completion at the end of last year, but the Scottish Government announced in June that it would not meet the timetable due to bad weather.\n\nThere are now less than ten weeks to go until the revised completion date at the end of May and 200 extra workers are understood to have been working on the bridge since the start of the year.\n\nBut much of the remaining work, including waterproofing the bridge\u2019s deck and removing the cranes and other temporary structures, requires favourable weather conditions.\n\nScottish Conservative Transport spokesman Liam Kerr has tabled questions in the Scottish Parliament seeking assurances there will be no further delays.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe last time there was speculation of a delay, the Scottish Government was slow to respond but eventually set out a new timetable for delivery.\n\n\u201cWe are now edging closer towards the expected date but again there seems to be some doubt as to whether the project will be finished within the timescale suggested.\n\n\u201cI think MSPs and the public have a right to know what is happening.\u201d\n\nA Transport Scotland spokesman said: \u201cThe contractor, is making every effort to open this iconic structure at the earliest opportunity. Extra resources have been brought in and an additional 200 people have been working on site since the turn of the year.\n\n\u201cWind conditions over the past few weeks have been challenging for the contractor. During spells of difficult weather our contractor continues to focus on the areas of the project less affected by these conditions. We also understand that\u200e the forecast looks set to improve towards the end of this week.\n\n\u201cAs things stand the target date for opening to traffic remains the end of May.

        "body2": "The Queensferry Crossing nears completion\n\nThe Queensferry Crossing \u2013 which was scheduled to arrive in June 2017 \u2013 will now arrive in May.\n\nWork on the scheme is currently making excellent progress, with the most recent update indicating the completed structure will arrive earlier than previously reported. This is welcome news for all involved, as well as those who have watched this fantastic project take shape.\n\nIn the most recent project newsletter, Transport Scotland Project Director David Climie and Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors (FCBC) Project Director, Michael Martin, said:\n\n\u201cGreat progress is being made and much remains to be done. We are immensely proud of what is being achieved out there \u2013 often in hostile weather conditions \u2013 by a first class team of committed and skilled people who are all working hard to complete this magnificent, world-class bridge to the highest possible standards.\u201d\n\nThe Queensferry Crossing is a hugely significant infrastructure project, currently taking shape in Scotland. The globally unique bridge, regarded as the centrepiece of a major upgrade to the important cross-Fourth transport corridor in the east of Scotland, represents a total Scottish investment of between \u00a31.325 and \u00a31.35 billion.\n\nDesigned to co-exist with the Forth Road Bridge as the main crossing point for cross-Forth traffic, The Queensferry Crossing is being constructed alongside the existing Forth Road bridge and once complete will carry the M90 motorway across the Firth of Forth, between Lothian and Fife.\n\nIconic, historic and dynamic, the spectacle of Scotland\u2019s Forth Bridges is a marvel of the modern world. Towering over the turbulent waters of the Firth of Forth, the structures represent the pinnacle of design and engineering. And, with the beautiful new Queensferry Crossing under construction, a new chapter is being written for the site of the world-famous Forth Bridge and its elegant neighbour, the Forth Road Bridge.\n\nThe bridge is of modern design using the latest techniques and technology. Key features which enhance reliability include: Wind shielding to almost entirely eliminate the need for closures during the frequent periods of high winds in the Forth estuary; the use of the latest and most durable materials; a continuous road surface allowing for a smoother drive over the bridge; the use of modern paint systems on the structure; and the use of thicker road surfacing with longer surface life which can be machine-laid making it easier to replace.\n\nFor more information about The Queensferry Crossing, please visit: www.forth-bridges.co.uk/queensferry-crossing.\n\nCollaborative approach for Queensferry\n\nThe landmark Queensferry Crossing in Scotland promises to be one of the most efficient, high performance bridges ever built. Designed to incorporate a complex array of utilities and communications equipment, a partnership between cable management specialist voestalpine Metsec plc, leading M&E fixings supplier in Scotland MEF and leading specialist M&E contractor SES Engineering Services Ltd (SES), has been critical in ensuring the delivery of the systems that will support the 2.7km road bridge and ensure its safe and efficient running for decades to come.\n\nDue to open in May 2017, the Queensferry Crossing forms the centrepiece of a major upgrade to the cross-Forth transport corridor in the east of Scotland. It will be the longest three-tower, cable-stayed bridge in the world and represents a Scottish Government capital investment of more than \u00a31.3bn.\n\nThe 250-tonne steel bridge sections arrive in Rosyth docks from China, where they are then prefabricated to incorporate all of the services and road surfaces. The cable management systems supplied by Metsec are prefabricated into 424 modules by SES and then installed into each of the 110 finished 750-tonne road section decks before they are taken out by barge onto the River Forth and then lifted by crane to connect to the span between the bridge towers.\n\nAll of the cable management products used had to be pre-approved by the construction contractors, the Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors Consortium (FCBC) which consists of HOCHTIEF Solutions AG, American Bridge International, Dragados S.A and Morrison Construction. Due to the extreme temperatures, thermal extension couplers for cable management were designed into the project with the support of the Metsec team to help compensate for the movement of the bridge due to temperature fluctuations, wind and traffic.\n\nGordon Cullen, Contracts Manager at SES explains: \u201cWhile we have extensive experience in major infrastructure developments, the Queensferry Crossing is a once-in-a-lifetime project that demands a highly collaborative approach to ensure we can meet and match the exact requirements to deliver all of the component parts of the bridge on time and on budget.\n\n\u201cMEF are a part of the SES approved supply chain and they selected Metsec not only because they were the best from a commercial and quality point of view, but because they were able to supply the cable management systems we needed in bespoke sizes, vitally important in terms of minimising waste and ensuring ease of fit. Particularly important was their willingness to adapt the units to minimise the number of joints required. Everything was spot-on in terms of enabling the teams to fabricate and install each unit on schedule.\u201d\n\nMetsec supplied hot dip galvanised cable tray and cable ladders cut to special size lengths, the trays to 3.5m and the ladders to 6.9m. The finished modules assembled by SES will hold a complex array of water management and cabling needs, from lighting and power, traffic management systems, security, fire alarms, radio communications, structural health monitoring and building monitoring, all designed to give optimal control over the management and performance of the bridge.\n\nCullen continues: \u201cIt\u2019s a highly complex installation that effectively acts as the \u2018brains\u2019 of the bridge, controlling everything from the timing of the lights to maintenance planning with a focus on optimising efficiency and communications not just on the bridge itself but on how it communicates with the traffic management systems that feed into it.\u201d\n\nAlistair Fairweather at MEF adds: \u201cThis is a fantastic project to work on and much of our involvement has been down to the support we have had from Metsec. We have worked with them for six or seven years and we knew that their involvement would be vital to us winning this contract. The sizes needed were not standard, but their UK-based manufacturing capabilities gave us the option to offer a flexible, high quality solution to SES that we knew Metsec could fulfil to deliver on time and on budget. In fact, flexibility was critical not just in securing the project but in meeting evolving requirements as the project has progressed over the past 12 to 18 months.\n\n\u201cWe have put a lot of faith in partnering with Metsec for what has been one of the biggest projects we have ever worked on and it has really paid off. The reliability and the quality of service from the Metsec team has been as important as the quality of the product. The 55 micron hot dipped galvanised steel tray and ladder systems used will need to endure exposure to the elements for up to two years before being completely sealed in under the bridge, and the high quality of the product will contribute to keeping the whole life costs of the project down.\u201d\n\nJon Hillier, Director at Metsec cable management division added: \u201cThe Queensferry Crossing project was something we were keen to be involved in from the start. We knew we had the capability to re-programme our mill to allow us to manufacture the specified lengths of ladder and tray in a way that would fit perfectly into the required modules. Working with MEF meant that we were also able to offer the just-in-time capabilities needed to support the tight prefabrication scheduling for each deck for the bridge. We are really excited about seeing the bridge completed and operational next year, knowing that our products are effectively supporting the complex systems that will drive the functionality of a bridge that is not only destined to be an infrastructure showpiece, but will help drive transport connectivity in the region for years to come.\u201d\n\nShare this: LinkedIn\n\nTwitter\n\nFacebook\n\nGoogle\n\nTumblr\n\nPinterest\n\nPocket\n\nReddit\n\nPrint\n\nEmail\n\n\n\nLike this: Like Loading...",

Zago, Argentinian Walter Samuel and Frenchman Jonathan Zebina combined for a back three boasting pace, power and ability on the ball.\n\nThey conceded 33 goals across the season, bettered only by Juventus and Parma, providing a fantastic backbone for Roma\u2019s attacking talents to flourish.\n\nThe best wing-back ever\n\nSpare a thought for Vincent Candela, a French international and fine wing-back in his own right, who was slightly overshadowed by the phenomenon playing on the opposite flank.\n\nMarcos Evangelista de Morais, known to you and I as Cafu, raided up and down the right with the flair only a Brazilian \u2018defender\u2019 could muster.\n\nThe 30-year-old, one of five Brazilians at Roma, played 31 times in the league, more than making up for the lack of wingers in Capello\u2019s squad.\n\nThe water carriers\n\nEvery good team needs the unheralded workers, who put a shift in to allow others to bask in the glory of goals and assists.\n\nCapello\u2019s side was no different, with Italian duo Cristiano Zanetti and Damiano Tommasi doubling up deep in midfield to win the ball back and keep it simple.\n\nZanetti would interchange with Brazilian Emerson throughout the season, protecting the back three and dropping in when Cafu and Candela streamed forward.\n\nThe holy trinity\n\nNow we get to the front end. The goalscorers. The holy trinity. Totti and Marco Delvecchio playing behind Gabriel Batistuta.\n\nAs with the defensive midfielders, Capello had plenty of strength in depth, with Vincenzo Montella coming in for Delvecchio throughout the season.\n\nThe quartet combined for 49 league goals, with Batistuta finishing as Roma\u2019s top scorer but trailing to Hernan Crespo, Andriy Shevchenko and Enrico Chiesa in the battle to be Serie A\u2019s Capocannoniere.\n\nMost importantly, Totti was free to roam as he so pleased, playing some of the best football of his career to be crowned Serie A Italian Footballer of the Year.

Indeed, he has not hit the target since October 2015.\n\nBe that as it may, there were definite signs of life at Lingfield last time to suggest there is the requisite fire in the belly to win a small prize like this.\n\nThe son of Soviet Star was sent off a 5-1 chance in a one-mile handicap and came desperately close in the hands of regular rider Paddy Bradley.\n\nSpiritual Star was stealthily held up by his jockey before he was produced with what looked a potentially winning run inside the final three furlongs.\n\nYet with the momentum seemingly behind him, Lee Carter's inmate suddenly encountered a good deal of traffic problems inside the final 250 yards. Once daylight appeared, he flashed home to finish third and was only beaten a head by Wink Oliver. That run did not go unnoticed by the handicapper, who has raised him 2lb to a mark of 67.\n\nEven so, it was only a few years ago that he was rated in the 90s, so that should hardly be an off-putting statistic. With Bradley back at the helm, a big run is anticipated.\n\nSEE VERMONT has constantly found winning hard to do since he struck at Musselburgh last August \u2013 but all that might change when he lines up for the Betway Sprint Handicap.\n\nRebecca Bastiman's sprinter is not getting any quicker but the nine-year-old is a capable operator on his day.\n\nHe was not beaten at all far at Newcastle earlier in the month either and it is also pleasing to see jockey Danny Tudhope keep the faith.\n\nSee Vermont is now 2lb lower than his last winning mark and has hardly been found an epic encounter in which to haul himself back on the straight and narrow.",

        "body2": "KABUL \u2014 As they did in 2016, the Taliban are again concentrating on overrunning Afghan cities this year. By the end of February 2017, the Taliban had already launched an attack on Mehtar Lam, the capital of the eastern Afghan province of Laghman. And according to a confidential report exclusively obtained by The Diplomat, the Taliban have amended their tactics in view of an allegedly imminent assault on Kunduz City, where also U.S. and German forces are deployed.\n\nOn February 28, weeks before the usual insurgent spring offensive that traditionally starts in April, militants attacked Mehtar Lam, with fighting reportedly reaching as close as two kilometers to the center of town. Only two days later, on March 2, the governor of Laghman acknowledged that, at first, militants had managed to overrun several outposts, but he then assured that these outposts were retaken by government forces and that the attack had been successfully repelled. However, a statement from the provincial government released on March 13 again claimed to have foiled the Taliban\u2019s plan to capture Laghman, implying that fighting continued at least until recently. And reports from March 18 even indicated that the insurgents were still just outside Mehtar Lam.\n\nThis, unfortunately, does not come as a surprise. Since the Taliban managed to briefly overrun Kunduz, the capital of the northern province with the same name, at the end of September and beginning of October 2015 \u2013 which marked the first time since the overthrow of their regime in 2001 that the Taliban had seized a provincial capital \u2013 they have continuously kept cities in their sights. During 2016, insurgents pressured the capitals of the provinces of Kunduz, Faryab, Farah, Helmand, and Uruzgan. While they managed to temporarily enter Kunduz and Tirin Kot, the capital of Uruzgan, fighting was limited to the outskirts of the other cities.\n\nUsually, the Taliban\u2019s tactic was to seize the surrounding rural areas before launching a larger assault on the cities themselves. However, according to a confidential report exclusively obtained by The Diplomat, the Taliban have amended this tactic while preparing a renewed imminent attack on Kunduz. The report indicates that this time the insurgents will concentrate on infiltrating the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces in order to also assault the city from within. In addition, the report states that insurgents are focusing on completely blocking the main roads to Kunduz prior to the intended attack on the city itself. While insurgents had at least partly blocked main roads in previous assaults on Kunduz, the report suggests that the militants are preparing to do this more effectively this time. In any event, the report asserts that government forces have already put effective counter-measures into place and that Kunduz will not collapse again.\n\nCorroborating this report, a high-ranking source within the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces in Kunduz, speaking on the condition of anonymity, told The Diplomat that there are indeed Taliban infiltrators among the police force in Kunduz. However, he also mentioned that this had been the case in the past and could not say whether infiltration has increased. The same source also received reports that the militants intend to completely block the accessory roads to Kunduz, but could not confirm to what extent the Taliban had actually implemented such tactics. He did, however, indicate that Qari Shafiq, known as Dawood, the newly appointed Taliban commander for Aliobod, a district directly to the south of Kunduz City, recently ordered attacks on the main road that connects Kunduz to the rest of the country. This included one attack on a government outpost near Kunduz airport, which lies just outside the city and also hosts the Afghan National Army\u2019s 20th Division. The source further added that it is expected that the Taliban will launch another assault on Kunduz in early April (he mentioned a specific date, which this author decided to withhold due to security considerations).\n\nOn the other hand, a source within the Afghan National Army in Kunduz insisted that counter-intelligence had successfully prevented any insurgent infiltration into the Afghan military (he had no information regarding the police force), partly corroborating assertions of effective counter-measures mentioned in the confidential report. The same source further alleged that the Taliban in Kunduz have been and continue to be pressured by government operations and have been significantly weakened, leaving them incapable of launching a successful attack. In this regard, he also referred to the demise of Mullah Salam, the Taliban shadow governor of Kunduz and reported mastermind of previous assaults on Kunduz City, who was killed in a U.S. airstrike in Kunduz\u2019s district of Dasht-i Archi on February 26.\n\nHowever, the source also mentioned that currently U.S. and German forces are stationed in Kunduz, which might be a hint that the situation is not as good as the ANA source portrayed. The deployment of coalition forces near Kunduz, including German and U.S. soldiers, has been confirmed by U.S. Navy Captain Bill Salvin, director of public affairs of Resolute Support, the NATO-led international coalition. According to Salvin, those troops perform a train, advice, and assist mission in favor of Afghan forces. It could not be determined when, exactly, coalition forces were stationed in Kunduz and whether this happened in connection with worries about a renewed insurgent offensive.\n\nAlso seemingly contradicting an optimistic view, an observer who spoke on the condition of anonymity told The Diplomat that insurgents had deployed 200 professional fighters to Kunduz for the imminent assault. This was partly corroborated by the above-mentioned security source, who alleged that around 150 insurgent fighters from the southern provinces of Helmand and Kandahar are stationed in Chahor Dara, yet another district of Kunduz. In this regard, it has to be noted though that, while such Taliban forces may constitute more professional and better organized fighters, they are \u2013 although media reports often label them \u201cTaliban special forces\u201d \u2013 a far cry from special forces in a modern military sense.\n\nBe that as it may, the Taliban\u2019s staunch concentration on overrunning cities appears to be, to some extent, odd. Many analysts agree that the Taliban \u2013 while capable of threatening or maybe even again overrunning a city \u2013 are unable to hold an urban center. In fact, this was corroborated by a briefing of the Royal United Services Institute for Defense and Security Studies based on November 2016 interviews with \u201cseven well-connected Taliban figures representing different constituencies within the movement.\u201d In this context, the briefing also noted that \u201cmany Taliban commanders worry that military gains are not sustainable\u201d and that \u201ctactical victories have come at great cost,\u201d with Taliban interviewees having \u201cpointed to heavy Taliban losses over the past three months [apparently referring to the autumn of 2016] of fighting in Farah, Faryab, Helmand, Uruzgan, and Kunduz\u201d that \u201cleft many in the movement questioning the utility of the military sacrifices.\u201d\n\nHence, this raises the question of why the Taliban nonetheless focus on assaulting cities. Of course, the propaganda effect of taking a city, even if only very briefly, is immense. However, from a military standpoint, the costs seem to outweigh such benefits.\n\nNevertheless, given the past year and the most recent developments from Laghman and Kunduz, it has to be expected that the Taliban will continue to attempt to overrun provincial capitals throughout 2017. And the first major Taliban operation of 2017 might very well be again launched soon in Kunduz, also affecting the U.S. and German forces that are stationed there.\n\nFranz J.
