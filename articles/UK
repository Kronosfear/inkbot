teaming with the skate oriented streetwear label  Vuitton will release a collection heavy on accessories   including skater type ephemera  The collection s reported high price tags have left Supreme s original base of skaters nonplussed  with many exclaiming that they feel  exploited  in seeing their tribal garb fed through the luxury assembly line   According to streetwear blogs  it s expected that a skateboard carrier from the collection   sold with skate deck and accessories included   will be priced at  54 500  Louis Vuitton did not offer comment on the estimated price   WWD rode the D train down to the Lower East Side  and spoke with a gamut of skaters   at an LES skate park  skate shop and skate bar    I think it s stupid as s t   an anonymous thirtysomething skater said of the collection at the Lower East Side watering hole  Forgtmenot  Most skaters who spoke with WWD requested anonymity for fear of retaliation from Supreme employees   a downtown tribe deeply rooted in lower Manhattan s social scene   A burly creative in Carhartt overalls also felt disenchanted by the Supreme Vuitton collaboration   It solidifies Supreme s place in fashion  which is so stupid  They started the brand as a f k you to fashion  and now they ve become it   he said  stationed at Forgtmenot    They represent the worst form of street culture   another thirtysomething skater said of Supreme  which received a cease and desist letter from Louis Vuitton in 2000 after it screen printed the luxury brand s monogram onto skate decks without authorization   When you go into the store  it s full of a holes  they vibe you out    Some went as far as to call the collaboration  a betrayal    hbd stefen  good job A post shared by DAISY TOM   daisyanntom  on Dec 4  2016 at 4 35pm PST  Supreme was started as a skater label  The brand s web site states its original intentions   In April 1994  Supreme opened its doors on Lafayette Street in downtown Manhattan and became the home of New York City skate culture    Supreme grew to be the embodiment of the downtown culture Skaters  punks  hip hop heads   the counter counter culture at large   all gravitated towards Supreme    According to skaters  this is no longer the case   It orbits skate  it s not really on the planet   one said of the brand s standing among the skate community   In the mid Nineties  the brand s original Lafayette Street store employed an array of New York famous youths   many of whom had cameos in Larry Clark s film  Kids    In the time since  the brand s streetwear cachet has boomed   becoming a favorite of  very rare  seeking collectors  Earlier this month  it was rumored that LVMH Mo t Hennessy Louis Vuitton was in the process of acquiring Supreme for  500 million   chatter that was ultimately dispelled   At the boutique Unique Hype on Elizabeth Street   which flips Supreme rare editions   a Parsons student said the Louis Vuitton collaboration will drive a deeper chasm between Supreme s skate base and collecting community    People are saying it s going to separate the men from the boys  Also change and divide the audience   said the student  who rifled through  560 sweatshirts hanging on the store s shelves   Multiple skaters told WWD that in the wake of its cachet laden expansion  Supreme has diverged from its skate roots   In visiting the Coleman Skatepark under the Manhattan Bridge  many teenagers expressed upset for the Supreme Louis Vuitton collection  but were spotted wearing Supreme    If you buy that Louis Vuitton s t  you re stupid   said one teenager    It s overly Hypebeast   said another teenaged skater   referencing the derogatory term for a male covered in head to toe  trendy streetwear  who lacks personal taste  The colloquialism takes its name from a popular streetwear blog   But older skaters   who own and operate businesses in the Lower East Side   reckoned the collection s financial opportunity   It doesn t seem to be the work of the designer  Nicolas Ghesqui re   it seems like the work of the president   looking to make their next Murakami   said the skater   I m not too concerned with everything else going on in the world   he added   Another older skater   a onetime frequenter of the shuttered Autumn skate shop   said the Vuitton collaboration could be the byproduct of current media culture   Everything is bigger and bigger  you have to be loud to pull off your next stunt   he said   Louis Vuitton declined to comment on skaters  claims of appropriation  But in a rare break with company culture  Supreme issued the following statement   Throughout the history of the brand  we ve seen our customers have apprehensions whenever we do something unexpected  However  we have always stayed true to the culture from which we came  ",
