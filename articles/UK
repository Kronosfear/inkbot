        "body0": "Manchester United made it to the last eight of the Europa League with a stodgy performance against oddly defensive Russian opponents. A second-half goal from Juan Mata was enough to seal victory on the night, though considering Rostov started in a losing position thanks to Henrikh Mkhitaryan\u2019s away goal in the first leg it was surprising that they made so little attempt to chase the game.\n\nIt was not such a great surprise to see United make hard work of breaking down their disciplined defence, however, but though the result was satisfactory in the end a worry for Jos\u00e9 Mourinho was the sight of Paul Pogba limping off with a muscle strain.\n\nUnited switched to a back three for the game, perhaps to match up with the Rostov system, though in reality the visitors began with something resembling a flat back five.\n\nThe home side had the first chance in less than five minutes, a Marcos Rojo header bringing a save from Nikita Medvedev after Daley Blind\u2019s corner, before Zlatan Ibrahimovic was presented with an opportunity through Mata\u2019s quick-thinking after Khoren Bayramyan had given the ball away. Briefly the striker was one on one with the goalkeeper, though he had been forced too wide for a shot.\n\nManchester United v Rostov: Europa League last 16, second leg \u2013 live! Read more\n\nUndeterred, Ibrahimovic took the ball round the stranded Medvedev and shot anyway, disdaining the option of Mkhitaryan arriving in the middle in favour of a waft over the bar from a narrow angle. Typical Ibrahimovic, one might say, though with 26 goals to his name already this season the striker is probably entitled to back his own ability.\n\nAlthough Rostov had occasional excursions over the halfway line the game was quickly turning into a contest between United\u2019s attacking ideas and their opponents\u2019 packed defence. A goal was needed to change that dynamic, and there were claims for a United penalty when Medvedev appeared to push Mkhitaryan out of the way to make a punched clearance, though the referee was probably correct in surmising there was nowhere near enough force in the contact to send the forward flying through the air.\n\nMkhitaryan had the perfect opportunity to put his side ahead from open play a minute later in any case, but after doing the hard bit by beating the offside trap he chipped the goalkeeper and ended up missing the target. Ibrahimovic decided to go it alone again 10 minutes before the interval, again ignoring an unmarked Mkhitaryan in the middle in favour of an ambitious shot from the edge of the area, this time coming close to justifying his selfishness with a powerful drive that thumped against an upright.\n\nYet for all the home side\u2019s evident superiority, half-time arrived with the game still goalless, and just the odd sign that United were beginning to get frustrated. While Pogba seemed particularly eager to impress after the debate on his usefulness that followed Monday\u2019s defeat at Chelsea, his contribution here was mixed.\n\nThere were a couple of huge crossfield Hollywood passes that unerringly found their targets and won warm applause from his manager, yet the Pogba radar going forward was not as accurate. A long shot and a free kick both ended up high in the crowd before he finally found his range on the stroke of the interval, bringing a flying save from Medvedev with the last kick of the half.\n\nThat turned out to be all the crowd saw of United\u2019s \u00a389m record signing. Attempting a sprint a minute into the second half Pogba pulled up, briefly sat down in discomfort and was led straight down the tunnel, to be replaced by Marouane Fellaini.\n\nWhile United were still in a comfortable position thanks to their away goal Rostov managed to show a signs of intent early in the second half with shots on target from Sardar Azmoun and Christian Noboa, both comfortably dealt with by Sergio Romero.\n\nPossibly spurred on by the thought of how embarrassing it would be to concede a goal and lose the tie to a side as unadventurous as Rostov, United finally got their act together sufficiently to take the lead just after midway through the second half.\n\nIbrahimovic started the move, rolling the ball out to Mkhitaryan on the right then moving into the area for the return. All he got on the cross was a flick, but it was enough to find Mata at the far post and he was able to turn the ball over the line.\n\nPerhaps a sign of how anxious United had become was that Marcus Rashford was waiting to come on at the time. Once in front, Mourinho told the substitute he could sit down again.\n\nRashford was waiting to come on again in the final minute of added time when Phil Jones gave away a free-kick. Christian Noboa hit a rasping shot from 25 yards and Romero made the save of the night with the last action of the game. If Rostov had done anything like that earlier, then they might have had United seriously worried.\n\nQuarter-final lineup complete\n\nRoma were unable to overcome their two-goal deficit from the first leg as a 2-1 victory at home to Lyon was not enough to see them through.\n\n\n\nThey made the worst possible start, falling behind to a Mouctar Diakhaby strike but Kevin Strootman replied immediately. A Lucas Tousart own goal on the hour set up a thrilling finale but Lyon held on for a 5-4 aggregate win.\n\nThe all-German clash between Borussia Monchengladbach and Schalke finished 2-2 on the night at Borussia-Park, with Schalke going through on away goals after a 3-3 aggregate draw. It was finely poised at 1-1 after the first leg and it looked like the hosts would progress after goals from Andreas Christensen and Mahmoud Dahoud put them firmly in control at half-time. But second-half goals from Leon Goretzka and Nabil Bentaleb, from the penalty spot, turned the tie on its head.\n\nAjax overturned a 2-1 first-leg deficit against FC Copenhagen with goals from Bertrand Traore and Kasper Dolberg giving them a 2-0 win in Amsterdam and a 3-2 aggregate success. Frank Acheampong\u2019s second-half goal saw Anderlecht defeat Apoel Nicosia 1-0 and 2-0 overall.\n\nBesiktas reached the quarter-finals with a 5-2 aggregate victory over Olympiacos.\n\nThe Turkish league leaders drew the first leg in Greece 1-1 but eased to a 4-1 victory in Istanbul despite playing 50 minutes with 10 men. The hosts quickly built on their away goal when Vincent Aboubakar \u2013 Besiktas\u2019 scorer in Athens \u2013 netted again to put his side ahead in the tie after only 10 minutes.\n\nWhen Besiktas extended their advantage through Ryan Babel after 22 minutes the tie looked over. However, Tarik Elyounoussi pulled a goal back and Olympiacos were given further encouragement just before half-time when Aboubakar, with six goals in European competition this season, was sent off.\n\n\n\nBut the visitors could not capitalise on their numerical advantage and Babel struck again in the 75th minute before Cenk Tosun completed the scoring with six minutes remaining. Second-half goals from Hugo Mallo and Iago Aspas saw Celta Vigo win 2-0 at Krasnodar to advance to the quarter-finals with a 4-1 aggregate victory. The Russian side had Charles Kabore sent off late on.\n\nGenk, 5-2 winners away from home in the first leg, completed a 6-3 aggregate victory against fellow Belgians Gent. Timothy Castagne gave Genk a second-leg lead before Louis Verstraete equalised with six minutes left in a 1-1 draw.",

night.\n\nThe world number one trailed 3-0 as Taylor looked to silence the raucous Ahoy Arena but the home favourite came roaring back to win seven of the next eight legs for a valuable victory.\n\nThe result ends Van Gerwen's three-game losing streak against Taylor while he remains unbeaten in this season's Premier League and trails leader Peter Wright by one point, with a game in hand to be played in Manchester next week.\n\nEarlier, Raymond van Barneveld had also thrilled the capacity crowd as he thrashed Gary Anderson 7-2 to boost his hopes of a top-four finish.\n\nThe Dutch legend was a 3/1 underdog to beat Anderson, who had won their previous 11 meetings, but he thrived on his 'Barney Army' of orange support to produce a stunning display.\n\nVan Barneveld averaged 103.71, hit five 180s and produced a superb 156 checkout that brought the 10,000 fans to their feet as he climbed up to fourth in the table.\n\nPeter Wright ensured he would remain top of the table after a 7-4 win over Dave Chisnall.\n\nThe UK Open champion was unable to produce the same kind of form that darts fans have witnessed from him in recent weeks but he was never behind in a contest he comfortably controlled.\n\nJames Wade ended a three-game winless run as he defeated rock-bottom Jelle Klaasen 7-3.\n\nDespite being roared on by the capacity crowd, Klaasen struggled in all areas of the game and Wade took full advantage to climb up to third.\n\nLike Klassen, second-bottom Kim Huybrechts is also in grave danger of relegation at Judgement Night in two weeks' time after he lost 7-3 to Adrian Lewis, who will now have ambitions of finishing in the top four.\n\nWinless Huybrechts is level on just three points with Klaasen, with both men a further three behind Chisnall.\n\nBelow is a full statistical breakdown of each match while we also rank the players' performances at the bottom of this article as well as provide the updated Premier League table.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR FULL SEASON

Thursday night.\n\nDespite being roared on by a capacity crowd inside the sold-out Ahoy Arena, Klaasen struggled in all areas of the game and Wade took full advantage to move up to third in the table.\n\nThe Dutchman only managed an average of 86.21 and hit just three of his 15 attempts at doubles, as his troubled season continued while Wade, who didn't hit a single 180, was far more

same kind of form that darts fans have witnessed from him in recent weeks but he was never behind in a contest he comfortably controlled.\n\nWright's fine 120 checkout saw him race into a 2-0 lead and although Chizzy was able to battle back to restore parity, the Scotsman rattled off three legs on the spin to open up a 5-2 advantage.\n\nA superb 123 checkout from Chisnall kept the match alive only for Wright to take two of the next three to take the points.\n\nThree-dart averages\n\nWright: 93.79\n\nChisnall: 90.52\n\nSCORING:\n\n100+ thrown\n\nWright: 12\n\nChisnall: 10\n\n140+

Adrian Lewis.\n\nWinless Huybrechts is level with Klaasen on just three points at the foot of the table, with both men a further three behind Chisnall.\n\nThe Belgian held a 3-1 lead over Lewis before a heated exchange of words on stage ensued and from that point Huybrechts seemed to lose his cool as Jackpot won six legs in succession.\n\nLewis not only boosted his survival hopes with victory but also but himself firmly in the mix for a top-four spot.\n\nThree-dart averages\n\nHuybrechts: 90.17\n\nLewis: 96.18\n\nSCORING:\n\n100+ thrown\n\nHuybrechts: 9\n\nLewis: 13\n\n140+

night.\n\nTaylor was aiming to silence the raucous Ahoy Arena and got off to a dream start but the home favourite came roaring back to win seven of the next eight legs and claim a valuable victory.\n\nVan Gerwen only managed a single 180 but an average of 100.5 and a formiddable checkout percengate of just under 78% meant Taylor had few chances once his arch-rival recovered from his sluggish start.\n\nThe result ends Van Gerwen's three-game losing streak against Taylor while he remains unbeaten in this season's Premier League and trails leader Peter Wright by one point.\n\nThe Dutchman has also played a game less having missed the round of matches in Exeter with a back injury, but he'll play twice in Manchester next week against James Wade and Raymond van Barneveld to make up for it.\n\nThree-dart averages\n\nTaylor: 93.87\n\nVan Gerwen: 100.5\n\nSCORING:\n\n100+ thrown\n\nTaylor: 14\n\nVan Gerwen: 16\n\n140+ thrown\n\nTaylor: 3\n\nVan Gerwen: 8\n\n180+

Take a look.\n\nMinutes later, Moses would get the better of Young again and the latter lost his cool, picking up a yellow card in the process.\n\nThe former Crystal Palace man has been a revelation for the Blues this season at right wing-back and Conte revealed earlier this month he saw the potential right away.\n\n\u201cI realised it quickly, that Victor could stay with us,\" he said at a press conference at Cobham Training Centre. \"I remember during pre-season, when we stayed in America, I spoke with him and told him: 'Victor, you will stay with us.'\"\n\n\"I'm happy to have this type of player.

His spokesman has denied the former president ordered any surveillance.\n\nHowever, Mr Trump has stood by the accusation.", 
        "body0": "At CyberUK in Liverpool on 14 March 2017, I was given the rare opportunity to sit down with two of GCHQ\u2019s NCSC directors, Alex Dewdney, director of engagement, and Chris Ensor, deputy director for cyber skills and growth. Here is what they had to say. Eleanor Dallaway: What are your thoughts on the professionalism of the industry and what more can and should be done? Alex Dewdney: There\u2019s a broader point about to what extent should the government \u2013 specifically the NCSC \u2013 give a stamp of approval to cybersecurity products and services? I think absolutely we should do that, that\u2019s a role for us, and I think we need to change and diversify the way we\u2019re doing it. CESG ran a whole set out of accreditations and schemes for all sorts of cybersecurity products and services: consultancy, incident response, pen-testing and so on. Those schemes were running for many years and were \u2013 to a greater or lesser extent \u2013 successful, but we hit pause on those and are currently going through a review to see that they are fit for purpose, or consider if any can be improved in the way in which they run. Some have been, and will continue to be, successful, and others need a bit of reform. What\u2019s really important is that we think of the customers and the beneficiaries in terms of those organizations that will be helped to do cybersecurity better, and not necessarily the people who are delivering the services. Over the next few months, you\u2019ll start to see communications about what the NCSC is putting in place in terms of a new set of schemes. Chris Ensor: Technology is really complicated so trying to say anything is good or bad is really difficult. That\u2019s the challenge we\u2019ve got, so more and more we try to simplify things down to make it as black and white as we can, that\u2019s what people want. Eleanor Dallaway: What\u2019s your opinion on whether the information security industry needs a Royal Charter? Chris Ensor: We\u2019d like the industry to be recognized with a Royal Charter. IISP is currently going through the application process. A Royal Charter is all about raising the profile of an information security professional \u2013 they\u2019re not just IT people. Having a Chartered status brings another level of recognition, a bit of gravitas, so that\u2019s great. However, you still need hiring managers to want a Chartered professional. It\u2019s easier to stimulate the supply side if you get people demanding this status. That\u2019s what we have to crack. Chartered status will be a great move forwards, but we still need companies and organizations to recognize that they need competent people. You could imagine that under GDPR, if you have a breach, the investigators will want to know if you had competent people on your staff able to manage data risk. If you can say \u2018my CISO is Chartered\u2019, then you\u2019ve done due diligence in putting in place the right person. If you take a risk decision not to hire someone who is recognized that way, then that\u2019s your risk and it may come back to haunt you.\n\nA Royal Charter is all about raising the profile of an information security professional \u2013 they\u2019re not just IT people Chris Ensor, NCSC\n\nEleanor Dallaway: Would a Royal Charter proposition be stronger if it came from a joint consortium of industry bodies? Chris Ensor: We are working with DCMS on this, we ran a workshop with professional bodies and there are two or three models which could be used, and we\u2019re not quite sure which is the right one. We need to talk to industry about where they think we should go. Option 1: We could define a set of areas and have a body, or bodies, responsible for each area with an overarching umbrella. Option 2: There\u2019s nothing to stop the existing bodies coming together as a consortium and working together for this Royal Charter, but they\u2019ve not managed to do that yet. Or, option 3: We just go for one organization \u2013 like the IISP. The challenge with the council is managing all the different stakeholders. There are a lot of qualifications and a lot of bodies playing in this space. If you\u2019re a user, does that help or hinder you? Simplification is something I really care about. Does a council make it simpler and allow people to navigate and know what body to go to for the particular skills they want? I don\u2019t know, but certainly the principle of whatever we come up with should be simplicity. One idea we had was to put out a competition and say \u2018who would like to be the partner of choice for government and industry?\u2019 as a professional body. If we did that, you could encourage a consortium to apply, but they\u2019d have to be a legal entity. I don\u2019t think we have a preference, as long as simplicity and quality is maintained. There are a lot of organizations out there, like the CRESTs of this world, like CyberScheme, like (ISC)2 who have a lot to offer. How do we make the best of that? Eleanor Dallaway: When the NCSC opened in London, how did the staffing work and how does the relationship with GCHQ work? Alex Dewdney: We are GCHQ. The NCSC has between 600 and 700 people at the moment and the majority are Cheltenham based, but not all. We have over 100 in London. Some have already moved into the building and the rest will move within four weeks. We want to grow as an organization so we\u2019re going to look to recruit in London but also there\u2019s scope for a little bit of relocation as well. Over time as the organization grows, the Cheltenham to London balance will shift. Constitutionally, the NCSC is a directorate of GCHQ so that means we are able to operate with a lot of flexibility in terms of moving people apart different parts of GCHQ\u2019s mission. As Robert Hannigan said, a lot of GCHQ\u2019s best people always worked on the cybersecurity part anyway. Eleanor Dallaway: In his speech this morning, Ciaran Martin, CEO of NCSC, said that GCHQ\u2019s 3000 private sector consultants are just as \u2013 if not more \u2013 dedicated to the cause as its 6000 civil servants. Is this true? Alex Dewdney: I don\u2019t think he meant to say that. They are not more dedicated \u2013 they are as dedicated. We\u2019ve run a staff engagement survey for many years and get really high scores because people love the mission. They come to work for us because it\u2019s public service ethos but it\u2019s also deeply fascinating, you get to play with great technology and learn all sorts of secret stuff which is absolutely brilliant. Over the last two years, we've done a similar survey for our industry colleagues who are embedded in the organization and that threw up really good engagement scores \u2013 they love being a part of our mission. Eleanor Dallaway: Tell me about the Industry 100 Alex Dewdney: It was announced by the Chancellor when we opened the NCSC. The idea is that companies lend effort to us to work with us on common cybersecurity challenges in a way that benefits us but also the company because it helps with giving their staff more experience. Our initial ambition is to get 100 individuals into the organization from industry.\n\nThey come to work for us because it\u2019s public service ethos but it\u2019s also deeply fascinating, you get to play with great technology and learn all sorts of secret stuff which is absolutely brilliant",

Hannigan said this reflects the fact that the internet is a relatively new creation and that it was not planned. \u201cIt is a gloriously chaotic and innovative thing and society is still trying to figure out how to cope with that, including how we do security,\u201d he said. Commenting on the creation of the NCSC, Hannigan said it was driven by the goal of wanting to make the UK the safest place to do business online after discussions with the then coalition government about the UK\u2019s ambition on cyber security. To achieve this goal, there was a need for coherence, prompting the decision to put all things cyber under a single organisation, he said. Hannigan said that GCHQ, having been an expert consultant for decades, then made the decision to step up and lead this initiative for government, which meant \u201ca big cultural change\u201d for an organisation that had previously had a very low public profile. \u201cAnd having headquarters for the NCSC in London, Victoria in a public building was a deliberate choice because it had to feel that it was joined with industry and open,\u201d he said. \u201cIndustry involvement is necessary because we need experts at the heart of this, coming up with solutions, not just ever-better processes.\u201d"
