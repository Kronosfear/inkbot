        "body1": "| CBI Press Team Update\n\nCarolyn speaks on Industrial Strategy and the Midlands Engine\n\nThe Government must answer five questions that will make Industrial Strategy a success, CBI Director-General Carolyn Fairbairn will say.\n\nSpeaking to an audience of 120 local business leaders from across the Midlands at the National Space Centre in Leicester, she will praise steps taken by Government to help businesses become more competitive.\n\nBut she will also say that the Government must sharpen its focus to make Industrial Strategy the foundation for success firms are looking for.\n\nFinally, Carolyn will set out the role of the CBI in bringing together firms from across the Midlands \u2013 East and West \u2013 to help the Midlands Engine unlock economic growth.\n\nOn Industrial Strategy, Carolyn Fairbairn, CBI Director-General, will say:\n\n\u201cThis Industrial Strategy needs to be different. In a transforming world, it creates the opportunity we urgently need to strengthen the foundations of our economy - from skills and infrastructure to research and innovation. It must be used to create the conditions for prosperity in all corners of the UK. And it must build on the extraordinary assets of UK firms and people.\n\n\u201cThe Government\u2019s Green Paper is a good starting point. But as first draft becomes final version, there are some important questions that need answering.\n\n\u201cFirst, vision - what does success look like in 5, 10 and 15 years from now? What kind of economy does the UK want to be, beyond the characteristics we all agree on, like productive and inclusive? There will be hard choices.\n\n\u201cSecond, measurement \u2013 what targets will be put in place? The Government needs to define its success in terms of measures and performance indicators. This is the bedrock of accountability and should be independently verified.\n\n\u201cThird, world-beating sectors - will all sectors have deals with the Government, or only some? If the answer is some, then which ones and why? Automotive and aerospace are bright examples of sound industrial strategy \u2013 the plan should replicate this success.\n\n\u201cFourth, focus. What is the hard-edged action plan that sits behind the 10 pillars? The current Green Paper lists many routes for change. The White Paper needs to prioritise, focus on doing a few things well, with clear actions and milestones.\n\n\u201cAnd fifth, consistency. What is the Government\u2019s plan to ensure everything does not change again in 3 years\u2019 time? Firms need consistency and predictability. There are too many historic examples of flash-in-the-pan industrial strategies \u2013 this one must be different.\n\n\u201cSo it\u2019s crucial that that business and the Government works together on a shared vision for our future economy at this crucial stage in the UK\u2019s history.\u201d\n\nOn the Midlands Engine, Carolyn will say:\n\n\u201cBusiness is ready to step up and make the Midlands Engine a success. At the CBI, we will do everything we can to bring companies together from across the region. We\u2019ve already done this through \u2018Business North\u2019, created last year to challenge and support the Government and drive the Northern Powerhouse forward. We need to build the same partnership here, and with a distinct Midlands accent.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s meeting between CBI councils from both sides of the Midlands is a big step forward. It\u2019s not a choice between East or West, but between higher or lower growth, more or fewer jobs, high or flat investment. It\u2019s a choice between succeeding together or failing separately. It\u2019s about putting the long-term economic benefits ahead of short-term political goals.\u201d\n\nOn the strengths of the Midlands, Carolyn will say:\n\n\u201cWhat would a Midlands Industrial Strategy look like? Well, if the solution to growing our regions is fundamentally local, then we need to trust local firms to know what\u2019s best.\n\n\u201cWe know the Midlands is a world leader in automotive, from Jaguar Land Rover in Coventry to Toyota in Derby. And the National Space Centre represents another of the Midlands\u2019 strengths \u2013 aerospace.\n\n\u201cThe next time the world\u2019s largest passenger airline the Airbus A380 touches down in Hong Kong, the passengers can be safe in the knowledge that parts made by 70 Midlands suppliers in Rugby, Hereford, Lincoln, Malvern and many more took the journey with them.\n\n\u201cBut we know the region has its challenges and the best way to level the playing field is education and skills. So we should attract our best and brightest into classrooms by incentivising STEM students to become teachers. We should build links between schools and local businesses by putting a career leader in every school. And we should broaden young people\u2019s horizons beyond purely \u2018academic\u2019 by increasing resources for high-quality technical routes.\u201d",

        "body2": "Teams from across the East Midlands will be joining the largest ever contingent from the region at the Midlands pavilion in Cannes this year. Here\u2019s a taster of what they\u2019re up to at MIPIM next week.\n\nAt MIPIM 2017 Derby will be a hosting several key business events on a range of topics including: city centre regeneration, advanced manufacturing and Enterprise Zones.\n\nDerby\u2019s full schedule of events will take place between Tuesday 14 to Wednesday 15 March, and will include the award-winning Derby City Embassy.\n\nJohn Forkin, managing director of Marketing Derby, said: \u201cIt\u2019s a great pleasure to unveil Derby\u2019s calendar of events.\n\n\u201cThe comprehensive programme reflects Derby\u2019s ambitions for growth and its expertise in advanced manufacturing and engineering.\n\n\u201cI look forward to working together with representatives from the private and public sectors, as we present Derby on the global stage.\u201d\n\nNottingham is set to take centre stage at MIPIM, with the city\u2019s delegation involved with series of events in the new Midlands Pavilion.\n\nMidlands UK, the Midlands-wide delegation attending MIPIM 2017, has revealed the events programme it is hosting at the global real estate show \u2013 with a significant number featuring members of the Team Nottingham delegation.\n\nMajor investment projects will be unveiled to an international audience, while discussion panels and presentations will cover topics including connectivity, housing and regeneration.\n\nOver 50 events \u2013 featuring nearly 100 presenters and panellists \u2013 are taking place at the Midlands UK Pavilion, more than any other delegation from the UK. Combined, these events are expected to attract thousands of delegates.\n\nThe launch of the Midlands Engine Investment Portfolio on Tuesday 14 March will feature Sir John Peace, chair of the Midlands Engine. Capitalising on the region\u2019s strong record of attracting foreign investment, the event will present the international community with billions of pounds\u2019 worth of the region\u2019s most exciting range of development opportunities.\n\nLorraine Baggs, head of inward investment at Invest in Nottingham, said: \u201cThe Midlands Pavilion will include a packed programme of events and Nottingham is delighted to be playing a leading role and significantly contributing to many of the presentations and panel discussions throughout the week.\n\n\u201cWe will be presenting Nottingham\u2019s approach to bringing forward regeneration projects, discussing how to fund development, showcasing the second phase of development at East Midlands Airport and key opportunities within the Boots Enterprise Zone. Other discussion topics involving Team Nottingham include the growth of the digital and life science economies, the impact of HS2 and smart cities and many more\n\n\u201cThis is a great example of how being an integral part of the Midlands Pavilion this year will allow us to make more of an impact as a city and ultimately secure more investment opportunities.\u201d\n\nA Nottingham business and logistics park will be one of the opportunities being showcased by developer Sladen Estates at MIPIM.\n\nSummit Park, located adjacent to the Mansfield/Ashfield relief route, is one of the region\u2019s key sites offering industrial, office, logistics, leisure and roadside uses over 45 acres and will be on display to attendees at this year\u2019s expo (14-17 Mar).\n\nChief executive Nick Sladen, said: \u201cSummit Park offers a prime location for businesses, with some 20,000 vehicles passing the site each day thanks to its prominent position fronting the A617 between the towns of Ashfield and Mansfield, which is widely considered to be Nottinghamshire\u2019s manufacturing heartland.\n\n\u201cThis area of Nottinghamshire is a very popular location for industrial and logistics use thanks to its excellent transport links to the rest of the UK, access to relatively low rents, rates and wages \u2013 with a substantial multi-skilled workforce on the doorstep.\n\n\u201cIt is great opportunity for potential occupiers looking at this area and we are really looking forward to speaking to people about Summit Park at MIPIM.\u201d\n\nUnits available will range in size from 20,000 to 600,000 sq ft depending on occupier requirement.\n\nSladen added: \u201cSummit Park is designed to serve all types of business, from small local firms and larger manufacturers right up to national logistics providers seeking a hub in the North East Midlands.\u201d\n\nThe mainstay of Leicester and Leicestershire Enterprise Partnership\u2019s (LLEP) efforts this year at MIPIM will be pushing its Enterprise Zone sites. The team is heading out to raise the profile of the sites \u2013 and will be using representatives as speakers at its events to push the opportunities.\n\nNick Pulley, chair of the LLEP, said: \u201cOur focus will be on our two Enterprise Zones \u2013 MIRA Technology Park and the Loughborough and Leicester Enterprise Zone \u2013 which is multi-sited and covers Waterside and Pioneer Park, Loughborough University and Charnwood Campus.\n\n\u201cWe see our Enterprise Zones as major opportunities for our city and region. Leicestershire is already at the cutting edge of innovative research, innovation and product development \u2013 brought about particularly through our three first-rate universities (Loughborough, Leicester and DeMontfort) and the Enterprise Zones will help to cement Leicestershire\u2019s role as the research and development capital of the Midlands.\n\n\u201cThere is already an extremely successful enterprise model at MIRA Technology Park and we intend to replicate this at the Loughborough and Leicester Enterprise Zone, but in the science, innovation and hi-tech manufacturing sectors. This EZ is expected to create more than 6,500 jobs, and will allow the expansion of more than 120 companies on site and see around 900 new homes built.\u201d",

Yanworth is currently the narrow 7-2 favourite for the Champion Hurdle, ahead of another McManus-owned runner, Nicky Henderson\u2019s Buveur D\u2019Air, while Uxizandre is 6-1 third-favourite for the Ryanair Chase.\n\n\u201cMark Walsh is going to come over and have a sit on Yanworth and Uxizandre, probably on Thursday, and the plan is that he\u2019ll ride both horses at Cheltenham,\u201d Alan King, who trains both horses, said on Monday.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know him at all, but he\u2019s a very good rider. I\u2019ve been very happy with both horses since their last runs and everything has gone well.\u201d\n\nDespite the lack of a past Festival winner against his name, Walsh\u2019s book of rides next week is now so strong he is the 10-1 fourth-favourite to be the meeting\u2019s top rider. His namesake Ruby is the 8-13 favourite to win the award for a 10th time in the last 13 seasons, while Noel Fehily and Bryan Cooper are 9-1 and 10-1 respectively. Fehily was confirmed last week as the replacement for Geraghty aboard both Buveur D\u2019Air, in the Champion, and Unowhatimeanharry, the hot favourite for the Stayers\u2019 Hurdle on 16 March, while Cooper is the retained rider for Michael O\u2019Leary\u2019s powerful Gigginstown House Stud operation..\n\nCheltenham 2017: Tony McCoy lifts Jonjo O\u2019Neill\u2019s pursuit of fresh glory Read more\n\nHarry Fry, the trainer of Unowhatimeanharry, is also responsible for the probable favourite for Saturday\u2019s Imperial Cup Handicap Hurdle at Sandown Park, the last major race before the Festival.\n\nAir Horse One, the winner of his last three starts, has been installed as an 8-1 chance for the two-mile contest after Peace And Co, the 2015 Triumph Hurdle winner, was a surprise absentee from Monday\u2019s five-day declarations.\n\nPeace And Co has not been seen on a racecourse since being pulled up in last season\u2019s Champion Hurdle at the end of a bitterly disappointing second season over timber. Henderson, his trainer, was noticeably positive about his chance of returning to winning form at a recent stable open morning, when he nominated Saturday\u2019s race as a likely target.\n\nInstead, the six-year-old will head straight to the Festival, where he is among the current ante-post favourites for the County Handicap Hurdle at 12-1, while Fixe Le Kap, who also runs in the colours of Simon Munir and Isaac Souede, will line up at Sandown.\n\n\u201cThe plan with Peace And Co is to go straight for the County Hurdle,\u201d Anthony Bromley, the owners\u2019 racing manager, said on Monday. \u201cFixe Le Kap will be his replacement as he needs soft ground to be seen at his best. It was purely down to the ground.\n\n\u201cFixe Le Kap is in the Martin Pipe [conditionals\u2019 handicap hurdle] and the Coral Cup at Cheltenham as he really needs further than two miles.

Like that game, it\u2019s set in the Lord of the Rings universe as inspired by Peter Jackson\u2019s films, and will once again see you tasked with thinning the ranks of Sauron\u2019s forces.\n\nRead next: Best upcoming games\n\nShadow of War was revealed in February 2017 with a cinematic announcement trailer that shows off the game\u2019s world and story, though doesn\u2019t reveal much gameplay. Still, this is where you\u2019ll find everything we know so far about Shadow of War\u2019s release date, price, platforms, and gameplay, and we\u2019ll keep updating it as we find out more.\n\nWhen is the Shadow of War release date?\n\nMiddle-earth: Shadow of War is coming out in the UK and worldwide on 25 August 2017 for PS4, Xbox One, and PC. The game will also be part of the Play Anywhere scheme, which means if you buy a digital copy from Microsoft you can play it on either Xbox One or PC, with your save data transferring between them.\n\nRead next: Best Xbox One games\n\nThere will also be an enhanced version released with Xbox One Scorpio support, but naturally that won\u2019t come out until the console does some time later in the year.\n\nHow much will Shadow of War cost in the UK? How to pre-order Shadow of War\n\nPre-orders are now open for Shadow of War, and predictably it\u2019s available in a whole slew of different versions.\n\nYou can pre-order the standard version of Shadow of War from Amazon or Game for \u00a349.99, or $59.99 from Amazon US, which will get you the base game and \u201cfour legendary Orc champions & exclusive Sword of Dominion,\u201d as a pre-order bonus.\n\nAlso see: Best games deals\n\nZavvi has the \u00a369.99 Silver Edition ($79.99 from Best Buy in the US), which includes the Slaughter Tribe and Outlaw Tribe Nemesis expansions and a Silver War Chest.\n\nThe next tier up is the Gold Edition, which is \u00a384.99 from Game in the UK, or $99.99 from Amazon US, and includes all of the above (except the War Chest is gold), along with two story expansions: The Blade of Galadriel and The Desolation of Mordor. It also comes in a nifty steelbook case.\n\nFinally, for the real die-hards there\u2019s the Mithril Edition, which any LotR fan will know is the best of all the fictional metals. That\u2019s an Amazon exclusive in the UK, and a GameStop exclusive in the US and includes everything in the Gold Edition along with some physical goodies: a magnetic Ring of Power, a cloth map of Mordor, some stickers and lithographs, a soundtrack CD, and the real attraction: a 12in Tar-Goroth Balrog vs. Carnan Drake statue, which does look pretty cool, to be fair. It\u2019ll set you back \u00a3199.99/$299.99.\n\nOh, and if you never played the original Shadow of Mordor, you can grab a Game of the Year copy now for \u00a315/$20.\n\nWhat is the storyline?\n\nThe first announcement trailer for Shadow of War showed off the game\u2019s story, which picks up shortly after the end of Shadow of Mordor, between The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings, still following Talion and Celebrimbor.\n\nRead next: Best PC games\n\nThey\u2019ve forged a new Ring of Power, and are going behind enemy lines into Mordor to try and spread dissent and undermine Sauron, turning his own army against him. It looks like that will involve fighting a Balrog, the Nazgul, and maybe even Sauron himself along the way - watch the trailer for yourself at the top of the page to see more.\n\nWhat are the gameplay features?\n\nWhile the announcement trailer teased the game\u2019s story, there was little (well, zero) gameplay on display, so we don\u2019t know a lot about what to expect. The press release gives us a little more insight, promising a major expansion to the first game\u2019s innovative Nemesis system, which saw named NPC enemies respond to and pursue the player character across the game.\n\n\u201cThe robust personalization from the first game is now applied to the entire world where the environments and characters are all shaped by player actions and decisions, creating a personal world unique to every gameplay experience,\u201d Warner Bros. claims.\n\nRead next: Best PS4 games\n\nThe new additions include Followers, who \u201cbring about entirely new stories of loyalty, betrayal and revenge,\u201d and Nemesis Fortresses, which \u201callows player to utilize different strategies to conquer dynamic strongholds and create personalized worlds with their unique Orc army.\u201d\n\nThere will be a gameplay reveal on 8 March which will hopefully show us more, and we\u2019ll update this article with all the latest news at that point.",

        "body0": "SAN FRANCISCO\u2014Before I gush about how slick and action-packed Middle Earth: Shadow of War is looking before it comes out for PC and consoles, I'd like to offer a huge warning: I didn't get to play it. Warner Bros. Interactive hosted the Tolkien-universe game's first major demo at a state-of-the-art movie theater down the block from last week's Game Developers Conference. The developers at Monolith carefully hid their controllers behind a theater seat, and the game doesn't come out for almost six months.\n\nFor some incomplete games' previews, those are tolerable limitations, especially if their basic gameplay systems (combat, strategy, interface) are neatly spelled out. And in a few ways, what I saw looks like a \"bigger and better\" Middle Earth: Shadow of Mordor. That isn't a terrible conclusion to draw. (While uneven in some respects, the 2014 action-adventure game enjoyed a solid reception by making the most of its Tolkien license, as opposed to being chained to a single book or film's exact plot.)\n\nBut, in too many other ways, Shadow of War is aiming its swords, axes, arrows, and spectral super-powers a lot higher this time\u2014and doing so in an action-adventure market that is looking quite different than it did in 2014. Thus, my challenge is to piece together how many parts of the demo were withheld for mystery's sake as opposed to being incomplete or bad.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"You left me to die!\"\n\nThe original game's hero, a ranger named Talion, has returned. His new journey sees him picking up at the moment when Shadow of Mordor (whose spot in the Tolkien timeline lands between the original Hobbit stories and Fellowship of the King) left off. Meaning, Lord of the Rings gaming fans have until August 27 to catch up; any review of the new game will spoil the original.\n\nThe demo revolved around one type of mission that Talion will embark upon multiple times in SoW: infiltrating and conquering a fortified \"nemesis\" outpost. In short, the original game's nemeses, which you typically encountered in normal missions, will now appear in their own giant, enemy-filled buildings. Those structures come in four flavors in the final game, ranging from simpler forts to strongholds, fortresses, and, the biggest ones, citadels. We saw Talion lay waste to a \"level 192\" fort\u2014which, to be clear, wasn't a tiny shack.\n\nBefore each nemesis battle, you'll use menus to examine the strengths and types of enemies you can expect, along with the powers that your own allies will bring into battle. Different creature types favor certain elemental attacks, have more mounts (either cavalry or flying), pester you with more sniper fire, or favor other perks. Monolith insists that enemy variety will be greatly increased\u2014thus responding directly to one of the original game's biggest issues.\n\nBased on how this siege sequence opens, Talion clearly doesn't care for stealth or guerrilla tactics. Each outpost siege begins with your hero marching through a crowd of his allied warriors, all shouting at their intended target. Dialogue plays out between your side and the \"dynamically generated\" enemies, whose traits and powers are supposedly formulated based on your actions throughout the game. Specific shouts about held grudges and desired revenge play out: \"I fought for you, bled for you, and you left me to die!\" shouts a creature named Thrak Storm-Bringer (referring, Monolith said, to another battle you fought in which one of your allies died at your side). \"But I was reborn with the power of the dark lord!\u201d From there, you and your armies charge the fort while enemy arrows rain from above, and Talion starts handing out ass-kickings shortly after he scales one of the fort's rock walls.\n\nMonolith producers insist that much of the dialogue and character design are subject to the game's dynamic-generation whims. \"Thousands and thousands\" of dialogue exchanges have been recorded, Monolith insists, with just as many character designs to match. \"That\u2019s hard for people on our team making content,\" Monolith VP Michael de Plater told Ars. \"That's a lot of awesome character art and dialogue that most people are never going to see or hear.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarner Bros. Interactive\n\n\n\n\n\nAt least we get a cool dragon\n\nEverything about the Shadow of War demo looked about as slick as you can imagine. Cinematic flyovers of the fort included grounds and towers covered in orcs, trolls, dragons, and other beasts, all rich in detail and varied in animation and attack patterns. Talion was able to hop onto a dragon, fly around, and smother enemies in burps of flame until the dragon was sacrificed in a dive-bomb attack against an even bigger brute. Each dialogue exchange included the kind of polished-yet-cheesy villain shouts that I expect from a shameless orc bloodbath.\n\nAnd the sequence made sure to show off how my own helper characters could turn the tide at just the right moments. A sniper's carefully aimed arrow went straight into the stabbing arm of a major fort chieftain, just as Talion was about to be sliced to death. Another near-death moment, while battling the fort's primary nemesis, is interrupted by your mount storming in, crashing into the sucker, and sacrificing itself to save your life. Plus, there was a whole crazy thing where a bad guy burnt half of Talion's troops with a giant, burning bath of hot tar, along with, you know, riding that flame-throwing dragon up and over castle walls to even the score.\n\nFurther Reading FTC: Warner Bros. paid YouTubers for positive reviews How much of the demo was perfectly staged to make moments look more dramatic than the actual game will dynamically generate? That's hard to say. What I can speak to is how lacking the demo looked in the compelling-mechanics department. Talion's Arkham-esque melee moves look positively dated in 2017; he can slow time down for automatic, gruesome assassination attacks. But normal battles appear incredibly pedestrian, with no compelling AI or intriguing dodge or attack tweaks. No more than a single enemy attacks at the same time. (Shadow of War does employ quick-time events, however. If you're among the 12 people on the planet who actually want those in your games, you're in luck.)\n\nWorse, Talion's ghost-vision ability to find and target foes has been soundly surpassed by games such as this month's Horizon Zero Dawn. I am compelled to note that Horizon also does a far better job of combining enemy-scans and weak-point data in the heat of battle than Shadow of War's demo appears to do. Monolith only showed most of that data in pre-battle menus, but that could certainly change by the time the game launches.\n\nFurther Reading Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor: A shadow of its own ambition In terms of cinematic presentation and the whole \"let's be a badass and wipe out an orc fort\" premise, Monolith has clearly put in the legwork to make its battles seem more epic than in the original Mordor game. Perhaps SoW's teased \"fort management\" system will bolster the game's scope, as well. As advertised, these will allow you to receive bonuses based on which types of soldiers you set up in any forts or citadels you overtake. They may get their own \"return and defend\" missions (though that wasn't made entirely clear).\n\nBut we didn't really see how fort management will play out during the rest of the game, let alone a single iota of overworld or open-world mission gameplay. And while \"thousands and thousands\" of revenge-shouting possibilities sound cool, the only hint we got about SoW's mainline campaign is that Monolith admitted the original game's plot was \"too short\" and ended \"too abruptly.\"\n\nde Plater says the game is officially in \"post-alpha\" status, which sets it up for its coming-very-soon launch of August 27. At least we don't have very long to wait for answers to so many questions.\n\nListing image by Warner Bros. Interactive",

I'm not ashamed to tell you that my research included a half hour conversation about the different headgear the Nazg\u0171l have canonically sported up to now.\n\nAnyway, ringwraith hats aside, I found nine interesting new developments coming to Shadow of War, all of which you can learn about in the video below.\n\nI'm still kind of obsessing over that wraith helm, to be honest - is that one of the nine or is there some new wraith hitherto unseen?
