        "body1": "The election (and subsequent presidency) of Donald Trump were galvanizing moments for a lot of Americans, energizing and activating people to call their representatives, take to the streets in protest, and do everything in their power to resist the current White House regime. But the post-Trump liberal wave just wouldn\u2019t be a real cultural movement without a big corporation doing everything in its power to commodify and commercialize it, so thank god Pepsi is here to lend it a giant, monolithic hand.\n\nThe company has released a new commercial today, awkwardly titled \u201cLive For Now Moments Anthem,\u201d that presents drinking its corporate sugar water as the ultimate act of hip rebellion for the anti-establishment artist on the move. The ad shows a number of cool, multi-cultural youths joining a growing march of smiling \u201cprotesters,\u201d all hefting signs with politics-neutral slogans like \u201cJoin the conversation\u201d and \u201cPeace,\u201d spelled out in Pepsi-friendly colors. Meanwhile, model Kendall Jenner watches the \u201cEverything Is Great\u201d parade\u2014which seems less concerned with asserting women\u2019s rights or condemning Trump\u2019s anti-Muslim rhetoric, than with taking the world\u2019s most woke selfies\u2014from afar, watching pensively before shedding her blonde wig to join in and solve the problems of police brutality with a simple can of pop.\n\nThe obvious attempts to co-opt the actual counter-culture in favor of a TV-safe, easily packaged message of corporate-assisted tolerance, put us in mind of another famous feel-good soda commercial. It also inspired this artist\u2019s recreation of how Pepsi\u2019s latest ad probably came to be.\n\nSubmit your Newswire tips here.", 
        "body0": "It's happened. The nadir of brands using ethical consciousness to sell products has been reached with a Pepsi advert that reveals the secret weapon in combating police brutality: carbonated soft drinks.\n\nHere we break it down scene-by-scene:\n\nWe open on a man virtuosically playing the cello on a roof. Why? Absolutely no idea at this point, but I\u2019m already very invested in his character arc.\n\nNow we jump to a protest on the streets, but a very client-approved one, where none of the signs are profane and all of them are strangely colour coordinated. 'Join the conversation' one sheepishly reads, presumably decided on after the first draft: 'Maybe talk to people idk haha'.\n\nNext up is shots of a Muslim woman drawing. This ad has almost surgically established how multicultural it is already, but the focus pull to the can of Pepsi reminds you of the most important thing here: cola virtually indistinguishable from that of other brands!\n\nOh, it seems Kendall Jenner just happens to be doing a photo shoot right next to the protest route. She looks over at it with amazement, having never come into contact with the proletariat until now.\n\nThe chorus hits at this point in the ad and I hate it deeply. \u201cWe are the lions / we are the chosen / we gonna shine out the dark\u201d Skip Marley sings, with what I can only describe as perfunctory defiance.\n\nCello guy is back! He\u2019s moved inside, having presumably realised that rooftops aren\u2019t really acoustically optimal. Nice apartment, though; look at that Pepsi-themed exposed brickwork. He hears the sound of the protest and moves to the balcony to survey it while drinking a cool can of Pepsi\u2122.\n\nUnidentified models totally \u2018rock out\u2019 at the corporate rally. Jesus, we\u2019re not even halfway through.\n\nFrustrated that her photos don\u2019t perfectly capture the Pepsi user experience while being socio-politically right on, this lady grabs her camera and heads outside.\n\nApropos nothing, protestors break into dance, because, if commercials have taught me anything, it\u2019s that taking up street dance is the best way to be true to yourself and who you are, live laugh love #IAmPepsi.\n\nCello guy makes plans to duet with a guitarist, and I'm suddenly grateful for the Skip Marley track because this would sound fucking god awful.\n\nKendall Jenner is SO DONE with modelling and pulls off her wig to join the protest. Remember that she has absolutely no idea what they\u2019re protesting, but when did that ever matter in 2017?\n\nBrief still of trans women just to ensure every last box is ticked.\n\nInstinctively, Kendall grabs a can of Pepsi and strides to the front of the crowd.\n\nThe photographer is there to capture the moment, knowing that a photo of Jenner has strong tabloid sale potential.\n\nThe model turned revolutionary hands the can to a curiously riot shield-less police officer who, seeing she is white, calls off the tear gas and graciously accepts the cool beverage.\n\nHe takes a sip and the crowd goes wild. Everyone can go home now, having completed their mission to quench the thirst of local police.\n\nThe officer chuckles to his colleague. \u201cI didn\u2019t even have to kill anyone!\u201d\n\nThe crowd returns to their racially diverse commune to host a slam poetry competition based around the themes: \u2018What\u2019s your favourite thing about Pepsi Cola?\u2019 and \u2018Doesn\u2019t oppression totally suck right?\u2019\n\n\u2018LIVE BOLDER. LIVE LOUDER. LIVE FOR NOW\u2019 the advert declares at its close. I\u2019d add \u2018LIVE IN FICTITIOUS PEPSI UTOPIA\u2019, because what we just witnessed had little effect in real life:\n\nWe did this in Baltimore. Nothing changed @pepsi pic.twitter.com/YveSvfmpYu \u2014 $1 Pizza Papi (@YeahItsWilly) April 5, 2017\n\n.", 
        "body2": "Pepsi made a new advertisement. People are having feelings about it.\n\nSo, what we have here is a two-minute \u201cshort film\u201d \u2014 Pepsi\u2019s words, not ours \u2014 in which a bunch of millennials have taken to the street for some protest or another. There\u2019s a photographer who appears frustrated with her work! Kendall Jenner is modeling in a blonde wig! A couple of women enjoy a little brunch! Some bros break out an electric guitar and a cello! Some other bros start smiling and dancing! Skip Marley, grandson of Bob, provides the score via his song \u201cLions\u201d!\n\nThe ad\u2019s climactic moment comes when, after throwing off her blonde wig and wiping away her lipstick, Jenner quickly joins the march of protestors and moves to the front of the pack as the crowd nears a wall of hostile-looking policemen. Jenner breaks ranks, stepping ahead of the other marchers to hand one of the officers an ice-cold Pepsi. He smiles and accepts it. Everyone cheers.

Then again, the entire internet is sharing thoughts about the ad, so maybe it\u2019s a huge success.\n\nOr maybe, everyone\u2019s missing the bigger picture here.\n\nWow. Truly historic.

        "body2": "EAST LANSING, Mich. \u2014 Michigan State quarterback Brian Lewerke is \"the guy right now.\"\n\nSpartans coach Mark Dantonio said as much after the Green-White Spring Game at Spartan Stadium on Saturday, and it looked that way on the first drive of the offense-defense scrimmage on Saturday.\n\nLewerke opened the game with a 39-yard play-action strike to Trishton Jackson down the right sideline. Lewerke hit Jackson again on a deep hitch for a third-down conversion later in the drive. Lewerke finished the touchdown drive with a third-and-goal touchdown pass to Collin Lucas on a slip route.\n\nMORE: Dantonio knows no easy answers for Spartans\n\n\u201cI also think our other quarterbacks are good players, too, but right now he\u2019s the guy,\" Dantonio confirmed afterward.\n\nThe Spartans need Lewerke to bet that guy heading into a telling season after a 3-9 mark in 2016. What that season told us was simple. Michigan State didn't get that next-level quarterback play that's been critical to the program's success since Dantonio's arrival in 2007. Brian Hoyer, Kirk Cousins and Connor Cook continually raised the bar at the position for the program and have gone on to the NFL.\n\nTyler O'Connor took most of the snaps for the Spartans last season, but Lewerke and Damion Terry were in the mix for snaps. Lewerke's season was cut short by a broken leg suffered against Michigan on Oct. 29.\n\nThe sophomore quarterback recovered, however, and he took most of the snaps in the spring game. Neither Terry nor Messiah DeWeaver played Saturday. Lewerke completed 25 of 44 passes for 305 yards and that opening-drive TD, but he also threw two interceptions when the Spartans had a chance to score.\n\nDantonio gave an honest evaluation of Lewerke's play afterward.\n\n\"He\u2019s much improved,\" Dantonio said. \"He\u2019s still going to mess up signals, and call the wrong play when it\u2019s supposed to be a different play, those type of things which are elementary mistakes that he will get past. I think he\u2019s progressed very well.\"\n\nMichigan State needs Lewerke to progress more as a redshirt sophomore. The program is in a pivotal year. Last year's 3-9 season came just one year after an appearance in the College Football Playoff. Penn State's Trace McSorley, Ohio State's J.T. Barrett and Michigan's Wilton Speight all return to their respective programs in 2017.\n\nIf Michigan State is going to bounce back on the field in 2017, then Lewerke will have to show signs of that next-level play that helped make the program successful in the past. He flashed that on the opening drive.\n\nLewerke is \"the guy right now.\" He'll have to be even better in the fall.\n\n\"Every time he takes a snap in an environment where there are people there or something of that nature he\u2019s going to get better and better and better.,\" Dantonio said. \"There\u2019s always a little bit of a learning curve, but he\u2019s a good player.\u201d",

        "body0": "Labour\u2019s failure to expel Ken Livingstone \u201cshames us all\u201d, Tom Watson has said as he warned the decision could incite further distortions of the Holocaust in public discourse.\n\nThe deputy leader\u2019s condemnation of the party\u2019s \u201cincomprehensible\u201d verdict came after Ephraim Mirvis, the Chief Rabbi, accused the party of failing the Jewish community by not ejecting the former London Mayor over his remarks relating to Adolf Hitler and Zionism.\n\n\u201cThis was a chance for the Labour Party to show that it would not tolerate willful and unapologetic baiting of the Jewish community, by shamefully using the Holocaust as a tool with which to inflict the maximum amount of offence,\u201d he said.\n\nFollowing an 11-month suspension, the party\u2019s disciplinary panel made the decision to suspend Mr Livingstone from holding office in the Labour party for a further year after they found him guilty of bringing the party \u201cinto disrepute\u201d over his provocative remarks last year.\n\nBut dozens of Labour MPs, Jewish groups and the Holocaust Educational Trust criticised what they described as a lenient punishment \u2013 referring to the suspension as a \u201cslap on the wrist\u201d.\n\nIn a statement Mr Watson added: \u201cWhen I read the words of Chief Rabbi Mirvis, who says that \u2018the Labour Party has failed the Jewish community, it has failed its members and it has failed all those who believe in zero-tolerance of anti-Semitism\u2019, I can't disagree with him.\n\n\u201cI wish I could, but I can\u2019t. I am ashamed that we have allowed Mr Livingstone to cause such distress.\n\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t just Jewish people who feel disgusted and offended by what Mr Livingstone said and by the way he has conducted himself over this matter, and it isn\u2019t just Jewish Labour members who feel ashamed of any indulgence of his views anywhere in the Labour Party. This shames us all, and I\u2019m deeply saddened by it.\u201d\n\nMr Watson added that the former Mayor of London\u2019s \u201cunrepentant media appearances\u201d in recent days have continued to discredit the Labour party.\n\n\u201cIt is hard not to conclude that his use of inflammatory language to dismiss the fully justified outrage of the Jewish community and others will incite further distortions of the Holocaust in our public discourse,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cMy party is not living up to its commitment to have a zero-tolerance approach to anti-Semitism. I will continue the fight to ensure that it does, and I will press my colleagues to do so too.\u201d\n\nMr Livingstone said after the hearing: \u201cToday\u2019s Labour Party panel extended my suspension for another year because of my political views, not because I have done anything to harm the Labour Party.\n\nKen Livingstone suspended from Labour party for one more year\n\n\u201cThe Labour Party\u2019s disciplinary process was not in accord with natural justice in a number of ways. For example, the panel hearing was not held in public, despite the fact that it could have been under Labour\u2019s rules. I was suspended for more than 11 months before the hearing was held.\n\n\u201cScheduling the final day of this disciplinary hearing, on the day the Labour Party launched its campaign for the 4 May elections, was a supreme misjudgment by whoever planned this in the Labour Party headquarters.\u201d\n\nLivingstone : There was \u2018real collaboration\u2019 between Hitler and Zionists\n\nMr Livingstone, a supporter and old friend of Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader, has been a member of the party since 1969 but was previously exiled for four years after his decision to stand as an independent candidate for London mayor in 2000. He returned to the party four years later.\n\nMr Corbyn has not commented on the suspension.",

        "summary": "The full text of the document is as follows:\n\nThe European Parliament,\n\n- having regard to Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union,\n\n- having regard to Articles 3(5), 4(3) and 8 of the Treaty on European Union,\n\n- having regard to Articles 217 and 218 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,\n\n- having regard to the notification given by the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom to the European Council on 29 March 2017 in accordance with Article 50(2) of the Treaty on European Union,\n\n- having regard to its resolution of 28 June 2016 on the decision to leave the EU resulting from the UK referendum(1),\n\n- having regard to its resolutions of 16 February 2017 on possible evolutions of and adjustments to the current institutional set-up of the European Union(2), on improving the functioning of the European Union building on the potential of the Lisbon Treaty(3), and on budgetary capacity for the euro area(4),\n\n- having regard to Rule 123(2) and (4) of its Rules of Procedure,\n\nA. whereas the notification by the United Kingdom Government to the European Council begins the process by which the United Kingdom will cease to be a Member State of the European Union and the Treaties will no longer apply to it;\n\nB. whereas this will be an unprecedented and regrettable event as a Member State has never withdrawn from the European Union before; whereas that withdrawal must be arranged in an orderly fashion so as not to negatively affect the European Union, its citizens and the process of European integration;\n\nC. whereas the European Parliament represents all citizens of the European Union and will act throughout the whole process leading to the withdrawal of the United Kingdom to protect their interests;\n\nD. whereas although it is the sovereign right of a Member State to withdraw from the European Union, it is the duty of all remaining Member States to act in unity in the defence of the European Union\u2019s interests and its integrity; whereas, therefore, the negotiations will be conducted between the United Kingdom, on the one hand, and the Commission on behalf of the European Union and its remaining 27 Member States (EU-27), on the other;\n\nE. whereas negotiations on the United Kingdom\u2019s withdrawal from the European Union will begin following adoption by the European Council of guidelines for those negotiations; whereas this resolution represents the European Parliament\u2019s position for those guidelines and will also form the basis of Parliament\u2019s assessment of the negotiation process and of any agreement reached between the European Union and the United Kingdom;\n\nF. whereas until it leaves the European Union the United Kingdom must enjoy all the rights and fulfil all the obligations deriving from the Treaties, including the principle of sincere cooperation laid down in Article 4(3) of the Treaty on European Union;\n\nG. whereas the United Kingdom has stated in its notification of 29 March 2017 its intention to fall outside the jurisdiction of the Court of Justice of the European Union;\n\nH. whereas the United Kingdom Government has indicated in the same notification that its future relationship with the European Union will not include membership of the internal market or membership of the customs union;\n\nI. whereas, nevertheless, continued membership of the United Kingdom of the internal market, the European Economic Area and/or the customs union would have been the optimal solution for both the United Kingdom and the EU-27; whereas this is not possible as long as the United Kingdom Government maintains its objections to the four freedoms and to the jurisdiction of the Court of Justice of the European Union, refuses to make a general contribution to the Union budget, and wants to conduct its own trade policy;\n\nJ. whereas, following the result of the referendum on leaving the European Union, the decision \u2018concerning a new settlement for the United Kingdom within the European Union\u2019 annexed to the European Council conclusions of 18 and 19 February 2016 is in any case null and void in all its provisions;\n\nK. whereas the negotiations must be conducted with the aims of providing legal stability and minimising disruption, and providing a clear vision of the future for citizens and legal entities;\n\nL. whereas a revocation of notification needs to be subject to conditions set by all EU-27, so that it cannot be used as a procedural device or abused in an attempt to improve on the current terms of the United Kingdom\u2019s membership;\n\nM. whereas without a withdrawal agreement the United Kingdom would automatically exit the European Union on 30 March 2019, and would do so in a disorderly manner;\n\nN. whereas a large number of United Kingdom citizens, including a majority in Northern Ireland and Scotland, voted to remain in the European Union;\n\nO. whereas the European Parliament is especially concerned at the consequences of the United Kingdom\u2019s withdrawal from the European Union for Northern Ireland and its future relations with Ireland; whereas in that respect it is crucial to safeguard peace and therefore to preserve the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, recalling that it was brokered with the active participation of the Union, as the European Parliament emphasised in its resolution of 13 November 2014 on the Northern Ireland peace process(5);\n\nP. whereas the withdrawal of the United Kingdom should compel the EU-27 and the Union institutions to better address the current challenges and to reflect on their future and on their efforts to make the European project more effective, more democratic, and closer to the citizens; recalls the Bratislava roadmap, the resolutions of the European Parliament on the matter, the European Commission\u2019s White Paper of 1 March 2017 on the Future of Europe, the Rome Declaration of 25 March 2017, and the proposals of the High-Level Group on Own Resources of 17 January 2017, which may serve as a basis for this reflection;\n\n1.\nIn pictures: European Parliament Brexit discussions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12 show all In pictures: European Parliament Brexit discussions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1/12 European commission member in charge of Brexit negotiations with Britain, French Michel Barnier listens at the President of the European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker speaking at the European Parliament in Strasbourg Getty Images\n\n2/12 Frank-Walter Steinmeier, President of the Federal Republic of Germany, delivers his speech at the European Parliament in Strasbourg EPA\n\n3/12 European Union's chief Brexit negotiator Guy Verhofstadt, President of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (ALDE), addresses the European Parliament during a debate on Brexit priorities and the upcomming talks on the UK's withdrawal from the EU Reuters\n\n4/12 Michel Barnier, European Chief Negotiator for Brexit reacts during a meeting at the European Parliament in Strasbourg EPA\n\n5/12 Member of the European Parliament and former leader of the anti-EU UK Independence Party (UKIP) Nigel Farage wears socks with Union Jack flag at the European Parliament in Strasbourg Getty Images\n\n6/12 Nigel Farage, United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP) member and MEP, addresses the European Parliament during a debate on Brexit priorities and the upcoming talks on the UK's withdrawal from the EU Reuters\n\n7/12 European commission member in charge of Brexit negotiations with Britain, French Michel Barnier gestures during speeches at the European Parliament in Strasbourg Getty Images\n\n8/12 The President of the European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker (L) speaks with European commission member in charge of Brexit negotiations with Britain, French Michel Barnier at the European Parliament in Strasbourg Getty Images\n\n9/12 European Union's chief Brexit negotiator Guy Verhofstadt, President of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (ALDE), addresses the European Parliament during a debate on Brexit priorities and the upcomming talks on the UK's withdrawal from the EU Reuters\n\n10/12 Getty Images\n\n11/12 German president Frank-Walter Steinmeier delivers a speech during a plenary session at the European Parliament in Strasbourg Getty Images\n\n12/12 The European Parliament in Strasbourg, eastern France Getty Images\n\nHe also underlined that Britain\u2019s divorce bill \u2013 up to \u00a350bn by some estimates \u2013 should be the first item on the Brexit agenda and that the UK must give guarantees not to turn itself into a Singapore-style tax haven.\nRequires the fair treatment of EU-27 citizens living or having lived in the United Kingdom and of United Kingdom citizens living or having lived in the EU-27 and is of the opinion that their respective rights and interests must be given full priority in the negotiations; demands, therefore, that the status and rights of EU-27 citizens residing in the United Kingdom and of United Kingdom citizens residing in the EU-27 be subject to the principles of reciprocity, equity, symmetry and non-discrimination, and demands moreover the protection of the integrity of Union law, including the Charter of Fundamental Rights, and its enforcement framework; stresses that any degradation of the rights linked to freedom of movement, including discrimination between EU citizens in their access to residency rights, before the date of withdrawal from the European Union by the United Kingdom would be contrary to Union law;\n\n19.\nIs of the opinion that the withdrawal agreement should address the following elements:\n\no the legal status of EU-27 citizens living or having lived in the United Kingdom and of United Kingdom citizens living or having lived in other Member States, as well as other provisions concerning their rights;\n\no the settlement of financial obligations between the United Kingdom and the European Union;\n\no the European Union\u2019s external border;\n\no the clarification of the status of the United Kingdom\u2019s international commitments undertaken as a Member State of the European Union, given that the European Union of 27 Member States will be the legal successor to the European Union of 28 Member States;\n\no legal certainty for legal entities, including companies;\n\no the designation of the Court of Justice of the European Union as the competent authority for the interpretation and enforcement of the withdrawal agreement;\n\n18.\nRecalls that, in this respect, it would be contrary to Union law for the United Kingdom to begin, in advance of its withdrawal, negotiations on possible trade agreements with third countries; stresses that such an action would be in contradiction with the principle of sincere cooperation laid down in Article 4(3) of the Treaty on European Union and should have consequences, among them the United Kingdom\u2019s exclusion from the procedures for trade negotiations laid down in Article 218 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union; emphasises that the same must apply in other policy areas where the United Kingdom would continue to shape Union legislation, actions, strategies or common policies in a way that favours its own interests as a departing Member State, rather than the interests of the European Union and of the EU-27;\n\n7.\nWarns that any bilateral arrangement between one or several remaining Member States and the United Kingdom, in the areas of European Union competence, that has not been agreed by the EU-27, relating to issues included in the scope of the withdrawal agreement and/or impinging on the future relationship of the European Union with the United Kingdom, would also be in contradiction with the Treaties; warns moreover that this would especially be the case for any bilateral agreement and/or regulatory or supervisory practice that would relate, for instance, to any privileged access to the internal market for United Kingdom-based financial institutions at the expense of the Union\u2019s regulatory framework or to the status of EU-27 citizens in the United Kingdom or vice versa;\n\n8.\nCommits itself to finalising in time the legislative procedures on the composition of the European Parliament under Article 14(2) of the Treaty on European Union and on the electoral procedure on the basis of its proposal under Article 223 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union annexed to its resolution of 11 November 2015 on the reform of the electoral law of the European Union(6); believes furthermore, taking into account Recital P of the present resolution, that during the negotiations on the withdrawal of, and on the establishing of a new relationship with, the United Kingdom, the remaining 27 Member States of the European Union, together with its institutions, need to strengthen the present Union by means of a broad public debate and to start an in-depth interinstitutional reflection on its future;\n\nFinal provisions\n\n33.\nExpects that, to ensure an orderly exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union, the negotiations between the European Union and the United Kingdom must be conducted in good faith and full transparency; recalls that the United Kingdom will continue to enjoy its rights as a Member State of the European Union until the withdrawal agreement comes into force and will therefore also remain bound by its duties and commitments arising therefrom;\n\n6.\n", 
        "body1": "The European Parliament has adopted a resolution which expresses special concern about the implications of Brexit for Northern Ireland and the peace process.\n\nThe lengthy resolution, which sets out the parliament\u2019s position on Brexit, also recognises the threat to the republic from the UK\u2019s departure.\n\nThe text was put together by the European People\u2019s Party, of which Fine Gael is a member, with significant input from Department of Foreign Affairs staff in the Irish Permanent Representation in Brussels.\n\nThe resolution recognises that majorities in Northern Ireland and Scotland voted to remain in the Union and said that the Parliament is \u201cespecially concerned at the consequences of the United Kingdom\u2019s withdrawal from the European Union for Northern Ireland and its future relations with Ireland\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt is crucial to safeguard peace and therefore to preserve the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts,\u201d the resolution says, adding that the peace is Northern Ireland was \u201c brokered with the active participation of the Union\u201d.\n\nIn a statement, Fine Gael MEP Sean Kelly said the resolution insisted on \u201cthe absolute need to ensure continuity and stability of the Northern Ireland peace process and to do everything possible to avoid a hardening of the border.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Parliament, which will have to give its consent by simple majority to any Withdrawal Agreement, states that it is crucial to safeguard peace and therefore to preserve the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts,\u201d Mr Kelly said.\n\nAs with most parliament documents, the resolution throughout insists on the important role that the parliament will play in the process. However, there is some satisfaction in Government that both the European Council and the Parliament have strongly reflected the Irish position in their approach to the negotiations.\n\nSinn F\u00e9in MEP Matt Carthy said that the resolution was \u201cfar from perfect\u201d but was superior to the document issues by the European Council President Donald Tusk last week.\n\nThe full text of the document is as follows:\n\nThe European Parliament,\n\n- having regard to Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union,\n\n- having regard to Articles 3(5), 4(3) and 8 of the Treaty on European Union,\n\n- having regard to Articles 217 and 218 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union,\n\n- having regard to the notification given by the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom to the European Council on 29 March 2017 in accordance with Article 50(2) of the Treaty on European Union,\n\n- having regard to its resolution of 28 June 2016 on the decision to leave the EU resulting from the UK referendum(1),\n\n- having regard to its resolutions of 16 February 2017 on possible evolutions of and adjustments to the current institutional set-up of the European Union(2), on improving the functioning of the European Union building on the potential of the Lisbon Treaty(3), and on budgetary capacity for the euro area(4),\n\n- having regard to Rule 123(2) and (4) of its Rules of Procedure,\n\nA. whereas the notification by the United Kingdom Government to the European Council begins the process by which the United Kingdom will cease to be a Member State of the European Union and the Treaties will no longer apply to it;\n\nB. whereas this will be an unprecedented and regrettable event as a Member State has never withdrawn from the European Union before;

Acknowledges the notification by the United Kingdom Government to the European Council which formalises the United Kingdom\u2019s decision to withdraw from the European Union;\n\n2. Calls for the negotiations between the European Union and the United Kingdom, as provided for in Article 50(2) of the Treaty on European Union, to begin as soon as possible;\n\n3. Reiterates the importance of the withdrawal agreement and any possible transitional arrangement(s) entering into force well before the elections to the European Parliament of May 2019;\n\n4. Recalls that the withdrawal agreement can only be concluded with the consent of the European Parliament, as is also the case for any possible future agreement on relations between the European Union and the United Kingdom as well as any possible transitional arrangements;\n\nGeneral principles for the negotiations\n\n5. Expects that, to ensure an orderly exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union, the negotiations between the European Union and the United Kingdom must be conducted in good faith and full transparency; recalls that the United Kingdom will continue to enjoy its rights as a Member State of the European Union until the withdrawal agreement comes into force and will therefore also remain bound by its duties and commitments arising therefrom;\n\n6.

Believes that the mandate and the negotiating directives applying throughout the whole negotiation process must fully reflect the positions and interests of the citizens of the EU-27, including those of Ireland, since that Member State will be particularly affected by the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union;\n\n9. Hopes that under these conditions the European Union and the United Kingdom will establish a future relationship that is fair, as close as possible and balanced in terms of rights and obligations; regrets the decision by the United Kingdom Government not to participate in the internal market, the European Economic Area or the customs union; considers that a state withdrawing from the Union cannot enjoy similar benefits to those enjoyed by a Union Member State, and therefore announces that it will not consent to any agreement that would contradict this;\n\n10. Reaffirms that membership of the internal market and the customs union entails acceptance of the four freedoms, the jurisdiction of the Court of Justice of the European Union, general budgetary contributions and adherence to the European Union\u2019s common commercial policy;\n\n11. Stresses that the United Kingdom must honour all its legal, financial and budgetary obligations, including commitments under the current multiannual financial framework, falling due up to and after the date of its withdrawal;\n\n12. Notes the proposed arrangements for the organisation of negotiations set out in the statement by the Heads of State or Government of 27 Member States, as well as the Presidents of the European Council and the European Commission, of 15 December 2016; welcomes the nomination of the European Commission as Union negotiator and the Commission\u2019s nomination of Michel Barnier as its chief negotiator; points out that full involvement of the European Parliament is a necessary precondition for it to give its consent to any agreement reached between the European Union and the United Kingdom;\n\nSequencing of the negotiations\n\n13. Underlines that, in accordance with Article 50(2) of the Treaty on European Union, the negotiations are to concern the arrangements for the United Kingdom\u2019s withdrawal while taking account of the framework for the United Kingdom\u2019s future relationship with the European Union;\n\n14. Agrees that should substantial progress be made towards a withdrawal agreement then talks could start on possible transitional arrangements on the basis of the intended framework for the United Kingdom\u2019s future relationship with the European Union;\n\n15. Notes that an agreement on a future relationship between the European Union and the United Kingdom as a third country can only be concluded once the United Kingdom has withdrawn from the European Union;\n\nWithdrawal agreement\n\n16. States that the withdrawal agreement must be in conformity with the Treaties and the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, failing which it will not obtain the consent of the European Parliament;\n\n17. Is of the opinion that the withdrawal agreement should address the following elements:\n\no the legal status of EU-27 citizens living or having lived in the United Kingdom and of United Kingdom citizens living or having lived in other Member States, as well as other provisions concerning their rights;\n\no the settlement of financial obligations between the United Kingdom and the European Union;\n\no the European Union\u2019s external border;\n\no the clarification of the status of the United Kingdom\u2019s international commitments undertaken as a Member State of the European Union, given that the European Union of 27 Member States will be the legal successor to the European Union of 28 Member States;\n\no legal certainty for legal entities, including companies;\n\no the designation of the Court of Justice of the European Union as the competent authority for the interpretation and enforcement of the withdrawal agreement;\n\n18. Requires the fair treatment of EU-27 citizens living or having lived in the United Kingdom and of United Kingdom citizens living or having lived in the EU-27 and is of the opinion that their respective rights and interests must be given full priority in the negotiations; demands, therefore, that the status and rights of EU-27 citizens residing in the United Kingdom and of United Kingdom citizens residing in the EU-27 be subject to the principles of reciprocity, equity, symmetry and non-discrimination, and demands moreover the protection of the integrity of Union law, including the Charter of Fundamental Rights, and its enforcement framework; stresses that any degradation of the rights linked to freedom of movement, including discrimination between EU citizens in their access to residency rights, before the date of withdrawal from the European Union by the United Kingdom would be contrary to Union law;\n\n19. Stresses that a single financial settlement with the United Kingdom on the basis of the European Union\u2019s annual accounts as audited by the European Court of Auditors must include all its legal liabilities arising from outstanding commitments as well as making provision for off-balance sheet items, contingent liabilities and other financial costs arising directly as a result of the United Kingdom\u2019s withdrawal;\n\n20. Recognises that the unique position of and the special circumstances confronting the island of Ireland must be addressed in the withdrawal agreement; urges that all means and measures consistent with European Union law and the 1998 Good Friday Agreement be used to mitigate the effects of the United Kingdom\u2019s withdrawal on the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland; insists in that context on the absolute need to ensure continuity and stability of the Northern Ireland peace process and to do everything possible to avoid a hardening of the border;\n\nFuture European Union-United Kingdom relationship\n\n21. Acknowledges the notification of 29 March 2017 and the White Paper of the United Kingdom Government of 2 February 2017 on \u2018The United Kingdom\u2019s exit from and new partnership with the European Union\u2019;\n\n22. Believes that the future relationship between the European Union and the United Kingdom should be balanced and comprehensive and should serve the interests of the citizens of both parties, and will therefore need sufficient time to be negotiated; stresses that it should cover areas of common interest while respecting the integrity of the European Union\u2019s legal order and the fundamental principles and values of the Union, including the integrity of the internal market as well as the decision-making capacity and autonomy of the Union; notes that Article 8 of the Treaty on European Union, as well as Article 217 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, which provides for \u2018establishing an association involving reciprocal rights and obligations, common action and special procedures\u2019, could provide an appropriate framework for such a future relationship;\n\n23. States that, whatever the outcome of the negotiations on the future European Union-United Kingdom relationship, they cannot involve any trade-off between internal and external security including defence cooperation, on the one hand, and the future economic relationship, on the other hand;\n\n24. Stresses that any future agreement between the European Union and the United Kingdom is conditional on the United Kingdom\u2019s continued adherence to the standards provided by international obligations, including human rights, and the Union\u2019s legislation and policies, in, among others, the fields of the environment, climate change, the fight against tax evasion and avoidance, fair competition, trade and social rights, especially safeguards against social dumping;\n\n25. Opposes any future agreement between the European Union and the United Kingdom that would contain piecemeal or sectorial provisions, including with respect to financial services, providing United Kingdom-based undertakings with preferential access to the internal market and/or the customs union; underlines that after its withdrawal the United Kingdom will fall under the third-country regime provided for in Union legislation;\n\n26. Notes that if the United Kingdom asks to participate in certain European Union programmes it will be as a third country, entailing appropriate budgetary contributions and oversight by the existing jurisdiction; would welcome, in this context, the United Kingdom\u2019s continued participation in a number of programmes, such as Erasmus;\n\n27. Takes note that many citizens of the United Kingdom have expressed strong opposition to losing the rights they currently enjoy pursuant to Article 20 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union; proposes that the EU-27 examine how to mitigate this within the limits of Union primary law whilst fully respecting the principles of reciprocity, equity, symmetry and non-discrimination;\n\nTransitional arrangements\n\n28. Believes that transitional arrangements ensuring legal certainty and continuity can only be agreed between the European Union and the United Kingdom if they contain the right balance of rights and obligations for both parties and preserve the integrity of the European Union\u2019s legal order, with the Court of Justice of the European Union responsible for settling any legal challenges; believes, moreover, that any such arrangements must also be strictly limited both in time - not exceeding three years - and in scope, as they can never be a substitute for European Union membership;\n\nIssues for the EU-27 and the Union institutions\n\n29. Calls for agreement to be reached as quickly as possible on the relocation of the European Banking Authority and the European Medicines Agency and for the process of relocation to begin as soon as practicable;\n\n30. Points out that a review and adjustment of Union law may be necessary to take account of the United Kingdom\u2019s withdrawal;\n\n31. Believes that a revision covering the last two years of the current multiannual financial framework is not required, but that the impact of the United Kingdom\u2019s withdrawal should be dealt with by means of the annual budgetary procedure; underlines that the work on a new multiannual financial framework, including the question of own resources, should begin immediately among the Union institutions and the EU-27;\n\n32. Commits itself to finalising in time the legislative procedures on the composition of the European Parliament under Article 14(2) of the Treaty on European Union and on the electoral procedure on the basis of its proposal under Article 223 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union annexed to its resolution of 11 November 2015 on the reform of the electoral law of the European Union(6); believes furthermore, taking into account Recital P of the present resolution, that during the negotiations on the withdrawal of, and on the establishing of a new relationship with, the United Kingdom, the remaining 27 Member States of the European Union, together with its institutions, need to strengthen the present Union by means of a broad public debate and to start an in-depth interinstitutional reflection on its future;\n\nFinal provisions\n\n33. Reserves the right to clarify its position on the European Union-United Kingdom negotiations, and, where appropriate, to adopt further resolutions, including on specific matters or sectorial issues, in the light of the progress or otherwise of those negotiations;\n\n34. Expects the European Council to take this resolution into account when adopting its guidelines defining the framework for negotiations and setting out the overall positions and principles that the European Union will pursue;\n\n35. Resolves to determine its final position on the agreement(s) based on the assessment made in line with the content of this resolution and any subsequent European Parliament resolutions;\n\n36. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the European Council, the Council of the European Union, the European Commission, the European Central Bank, the national parliaments and the Government of the United Kingdom.", 
        "body0": "Resolution on negotiating mandate insists that transition arrangement for UK after 2019 can last no longer than three years\n\nThe European parliament has overwhelmingly backed a resolution detailing its red lines for Brexit negotiations.\n\nMEPs in Strasbourg approved the negotiating mandate by 516 votes to 133, with 50 abstentions, comfortably exceeding the two-thirds majority sought by parliament leaders to show unity behind their approach.\n\nThe resolution calls for phased negotiations in the divorce proceedings, going against the wishes of London, which would like exit talks and discussions of a future trade arrangement to happen in parallel. It also asserts that the UK must respect its membership obligations until it leaves the EU.\n\nSpeaking during the debate that preceded the vote, the EU\u2019s chief negotiator picked apart Theresa May\u2019s argument for a swift Brexit deal, warning that parallel divorce and trade talks would be \u201cvery risky\u201d.\n\nMichel Barnier said it was not a ruse on the part of the EU to insist on dealing with the UK\u2019s divorce bill first, but an essential precondition for success.\n\nCiting the British prime minister\u2019s six-page letter notifying the EU of the country\u2019s intention to withdraw, he said: \u201cTheresa May\u2019s letter seeks a rapid agreement but, honourable members, the devil is quite clearly going to be in the detail and the six months of work done so far points to that.\n\n\u201cA single financial settlement, as a result of UK commitments to the EU, and the EU commitments to the UK, there your resolution is very clear. We do not seek to punish the UK but simply ask the UK to deliver on its commitments and undertakings as a member of the EU.\u201d\n\nBarnier said the European parliament\u2019s resolution, as the first response to May\u2019s letter by an EU institution, would set the tone for the talks.\n\nThe resolution insists that a transition arrangement for the UK after 2019 can last no longer than three years.\n\nThe European court of justice would also be responsible for settling any legal challenges during the transition period, according to the parliament, and there would be no special deal for the City of London \u201cproviding UK-based undertakings preferential access to the single marketand, or the customs union\u201d. The parliament has the right to veto any future deal between the UK and the EU.\n\nAddressing the former Ukip leader, Nigel Farage, who earlier in the debate accused the EU of behaving like the mafia in making \u201cimpossible demands\u201d, Barnier said: \u201cIn fact, Mr Farage, all we are doing is settling the accounts no more, no less\u201d.\n\nThe EU believes that the Treasury will need to pay about \u20ac60bn (\u00a351bn) to cover unpaid budget commitments, pension liabilities, loan guarantees and spending on UK-based projects.\n\nSome cabinet ministers have dismissed the idea of the UK paying a large bill on leaving. However, Barnier explained that the EU could not with confidence discuss the future without the British government having dealt with its commitments from the past.\n\n\u201cThe UK letter makes clear that the UK government will push for parallel negotiations on the withdrawal and the future relations,\u201d he said.\n\nUK seeks to cool tensions with EU over Gibraltar Read more\n\n\u201cThis is a very risky approach. To succeed we need, on the contrary, to devote the first phase of the negotiation to reaching an agreement on the principles of exit. We are not proposing this to be tactical or to create difficulties for the UK.\n\n\u201cOn the contrary, it is an essential condition to maximise the chance of reaching an agreement together in two years, which is very short. It is also our best chance to build trust. To build trust before proceeding to the second phase of negotiations.\u201d\n\nBarnier explained that, contrary to May\u2019s recent claims that the EU and UK would negotiate a trade deal after settling the issues of money and citizens\u2019 rights, the second phase of talks would merely be a matter of scoping out what a possible deal would look like and coming to an agreement on a transition arrangement to cushion the UK\u2019s withdrawal on 29 March 2019.\n\n\u201cTo put it differently, the sooner we agree on the principles of an orderly withdrawal, the sooner we can prepare our future relations, a free and fair trade agreement, a level playing field, but also in security and defence.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe European parliament\u2019s Brexit coordinator, Guy Verhofstadt, spoke sadly of Britain\u2019s withdrawal, but admitted it had \u201cnever been a love affair\u201d. \u201cPerhaps it was always impossible to unite Great Britain with the continent\u201d, he added.\n\n\n\nHe said he believed a young leader would in time try to place the UK back in the EU, when a new generation was able to see Brexit \u201cfor what it is \u2013 a catfight in the Conservative party that got out of hand, a loss of time, a waste of energy, a stupidity\u201d.",

They will pick over a world of bewildering social change, breakneck technological evolution and frenetic, furious politics. And when they scrutinise cricket, they will see a sport buffeted and renewed by these riptides of revolution. Yet in a world devoted to the instantaneous, Alastair Cook\u2019s Test career has been an epic of throwback pragmatism.\n\nCook has played 140 Test matches in 11 years, scoring over 11,000 runs, with 83 innings of 50 or more. He has batted for 551 hours in Tests, overtaken Graham Gooch\u2019s England record of 8,900 runs, crossed the 10,000 mark, and made 30 hundreds, another England record. Beneath the surface, however, lies a career of curious inconsistencies.\n\nTake his conversion stats. By the end of June 2007, he had turned six of his first 11 half-centuries into hundreds. Between then and the end of the third Test in the Caribbean in February 2009, it was only one out of 14.\n\nBut between the fourth Test in Barbados, where he scored 94 and 139 not out on a futile featherbed, and the start of the 2013 Ashes, he converted 18 out of 29 (along with five dismissals in the nineties) \u2013 the second-best out of the 46 batsmen with at least 10 half-centuries in that period, behind only Jacques Kallis.\n\nBetween July 2013 and December 2016, by contrast, Cook converted only five of his 29 fifties into hundreds \u2013 the second-worst conversion rate among the 38 players with 10 or more.

He was replaced by Root, who will captain England for the first time against South Africa at Lord's on July 6.\n\nAlastair Cook says he will support and help new England Test captain Joe Root\n\n'A lot will be made of it, there always is, it's a good story to write about but I think it'll be absolutely fine in terms of our relationship,' Cook said.\n\nThe former captain said he hoped his transition back to just playing for the team would be smooth.\n\n'I feel like I can get back in the troops and get on with it and hopefully score some runs and help England win cricket games, which ultimately is what everyone wants to see,' he added.\n\nThe left-handed opening batsman has scored more Test centuries than any of his predecessors and is also England's most prolific run-getter with 11,057 runs in 140 Tests.\n\nCook is set to play for England under Root at Lord's in July against South Africa\n\nWith the emergence of a pair of batting prospects in India for England's fragile top order, Cook hoped he could continue making an impact with the willow.\n\nHaseeb Hameed and Keaton Jennings became Cook's 10th and 11th opening partners since the retirement of Andrew Strauss, with both youngsters showing signs they might have bright futures after impressive debuts in India.\n\n'You're always under pressure, that's what life is about,' Cook said. 'That is what playing international cricket or being a professional sportsman is. You're there to score runs.\n\n'If you don't do that over a period of time, people will look elsewhere. That hasn't changed and that'll never change, whether it's myself or Jimmy Anderson, you've got to play to a certain level to be picked for England or even Essex.'",
