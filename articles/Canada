seven months after opening  Luc s Pizza and Eatery was shuttered  the owners citing high electricity costs and an inability to pay their Hydro One bills  which by this time had reached  12 000   causing the utility company to shut down the restaurant s power   In December  Hydro One announced its Winter Relief Program which sought to reconnect approximately 1 400 Hydro One residential customers who were disconnected due to unpaid bills    This program is about doing the right thing for our customers who are experiencing hardship   said Ferio Pugliese  executive vice president  Customer Care and Corporate Affairs  in a Hydro One press release   We are changing the way we do business and by doing so we are currently reviewing all of our customer facing policies and practices  including how we care for our most vulnerable customers  The Winter Relief Program is one of many changes we will be undertaking    It appears Hydro One was feeling pressure from small businesses  like Luc s Pizza and Eatery  too   Proprietor Luc Noel immediately went to the media  sharing the story of a family trying to live out their dream of opening a restaurant serving home cooked meals and delicious thin crust pizza a dream that was dashed due to sky high hydro bills  The attention he received was instant   Soon after the media frenzy  Hydro One reached out to Mr  Noel and his wife Karen  suggesting the two work out a deal    They contacted us and said  we need to resolve this    Mr  Noel told The Expositor   I said  I can tell you right now  I don t have the money     Mr  Noel proposed a  1 000 month payment on top of their monthly bill this would clear the debt in one year s time  The Hydro One representative countered with a  5 000 payment  with the rest of the  7 000 debt wiped clean   On Monday of last week Mr  Noel had rounded up the money  deposited it into his bank account  informed Hydro One  and within two hours the hydro was back on   Mr  Noel noted the restaurant lost a lot of money by having to throw out all the food when the power was turned off and is currently raising the capital needed to buy groceries for a fresh start  By Saturday the restaurant was open   Mr  Noel said customers can expect a slight increase in prices   but nothing major    The family is also looking to rid the restaurant of some of its electrical equipment in favour of propane as a cost savings measure  The husband and wife team will also be largely running the operation themselves  also to save money as they start back up again    This place has potential   he added   Mr  Noel told The Expositor that while he is pleased with Hydro One s response  he informed them  they need to fix the larger problem   He has spent plenty of time going over his bills and is baffled as to why their off peak hours see the highest consumption the time when the doors are closed and the ovens are off   It s costing almost twice as much when there is no one there   he said    We re going to give it another kick at the cat   Mr  Noel said   If it doesn t go this time  we lose everything  and that s the disheartening part    When contacted by The Expositor  Hydro One spokesperson Nancy Clark said that while she cannot comment on a specific case  the  Winter Relief Program was created to help our residential customers facing extreme hardship get reconnected during the winter  Hydro One works with residential customers and businesses on a case by case basis  to help get and keep their accounts in good standing     We are changing the way we do business and are committed to being a customer focused  well managed company   Ms  Clark added   We are working to keep our costs down and keep any increases on our portion of the bill  the delivery line  to what is required to ensure that electricity is delivered to our customers when and where they need it    Last week the premier announced further relief coming to Northern and rural residents of the province who are facing  even more of a challenge  in paying their electricity bills  This comes on top of the  1 billion in a year in HST rebates already announced by the province    It s long overdue   Algoma Manitoulin MPP Michael Mantha told The Expositor  referencing the premier s news of a relief program    Ontarians  particularly Northern Ontarians  have been asking for this for a long time   he added   The MPP noted how beneficial it was to bring the Hydro One Ombudsman and Mr  Pugliese to Manitoulin to hear the concerns of residents firsthand as well as suggestions on how Hydro One can be more helpful to residents and businesses alike    There is light at the end of the tunnel   he said   Mr  Mantha spoke of his work with Legions in the riding and seeing their bills credited or changes made to their billing  as well as area not for profits that were also struggling to keep the lights on    I keep hearing  day in and day out  about delivery fees deliver fees that are higher than the actual usage   the MPP continued   Mr  Mantha said he is looking forward to getting back to Queen s Park and especially the February 28 debate on the proposed legislation concerning Hydro One   I look forward to questioning some of those decisions and ensuring they are not just a splash  something that looks good on paper  but actual  tangible savings that allow residents to pay their rent and put food in the cupboards     This is the most important decision bar none 80 percent of the complaints that come into my office are about hydro   Mr  Mantha added   He spoke of a recent constituency clinic on Manitoulin where he met with a widowed pensioner who had been paying Hydro One bills that ranged from  700 to  1 400 a month   She was in tears   he said  Together they reviewed her bill and identified issues to bring to Hydro One s attention which will mean a savings moving forward    There are so many proud people who just don t ask questions  they just pay it   he continued   Mr  Mantha said he was overjoyed to hear the news of Mr  Noel and his family  with whom he had met last month    Luc and his family show the true spirit and heart of not giving up   he said   I m happy to see that Hydro One responded and am very happy he ll be reopening  I know they ll do well and that the community will support them    Hydro One encourages any customer experiencing difficulties paying their bill to contact the customer communications centre at 1 888 664 9376 ",

consulted Mr  Mulroney regularly       Mr  Mulroney  who served as prime minister from 1984 1993  currently is a senior partner with the law firm of Norton Rose Fulbright and spends a lot of time in New York  Washington  D C   and Florida for business reasons   Mr  McMillan said his former boss is one of the most well connected Canadian politicians in the world  adding that political and business leaders reach out to the former prime minister on a regular basis  In the U S   he said  Mr  Mulroney has had friendly relationships with all U S  presidents going back to Ronald Regan  and other top politicians both in the Republican and Democratic parties  Mr  McMillan said Mr  Mulroney knows many members of Mr  Trump s inner circle  including U S  Vice President Mike Pence  Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross  Secretary of State Rex Tillerson  and Energy Secretary Rick Perry    It is hardly a surprise that he has known Donald Trump for many years  and many in his cabinet and circle of advisers  such as Secretary of State Rex Tillerson  Wilbur Ross  and energy secretary  Rick Perry  and VP Pence  just as he was close with President Obama  Hillary Clinton  John Kerry  the late Senator Ted Kennedy and VP Joe Biden   Mr  McMillan  who now is a professor of strategic management and international business at York University s Schulich School of Business in Toronto  later wrote in an email to The Hill Times    Personally  I find that in a world of globalization  political and technological uncertainty  successful political incumbent political leaders seek out external advice and counsel from people like Brian Mulroney  especially when the advice is forthright  honest  and private        Mr  Mulroney recently sang When Irish Eyes are Smiling at Mr  Trump s Mar a Lago private club in Florida for the Dana Farber Cancer Institute fundraiser  In 1985  the former prime minister and his wife Mila joined then U S  president Ronald Reagan and his wife Nancy in singing this song at the  Shamrock Summit  in Qu bec City   The Prime Minister s Office declined to discuss any specifics related to Mr  Mulroney s work in helping out the Trudeau government in Canada U S  relations    We are drawing upon advice from different Canadians who have offered to help  and we are pleased the former prime minister has been able to be helpful bridge to Republicans  including the president  underscoring the unique relationship between our two countries   said PMO press secretary Cameron Ahmed in an email to The Hill Times   The Prime Minister has spoken with the former prime minister on a few occasions  and we look forward to continuing to work with the former prime minister    Transport Minister Marc Garneau  Notre Dame de Gr ce Westmount  Que    chair of the Cabinet Committee on Canada United States Relations  also declined to discuss any specifics about Mr  Mulroney s work  but confirmed that Mr  Mulroney is not getting paid for this work    He s doing it as somebody who wants to foster good relationship  between the two countries    said Mr  Garneau   Mr  Garneau said he invited Mr  Mulroney to attend a meeting of the cabinet committee and talk to the members about Canada U S  relations  He added that the committee chose to invite the former prime minister in order to learn more from his political experience  knowledge  and contacts in the U S  political and business communities  Members of the Canada United States Relations Cabinet Committee include  Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale  Regina Wascana  Sask    Government House Leader Bardish Chagger

the Canada U S  relations cabinet committee in the coming months  and  so we will have an opportunity to hear from him personally as a group   said Mr  Garneau    It s based on his experience and knowledge of business people and politicians in the United States    Mr  Mulroney has known Prime Minister Trudeau since he was a child  But  the relationship between the two has warmed up since 2013  At the time  Mr  Mulroney warned that no one should underestimate Mr  Trudeau as a politician    I ve known Justin since he was a child  He s young  articulate  attractive a flawlessly bilingual young man  What s not to like with this picture   Mr  Mulroney told CTV in April 2013 and warned that anyone who  treats Justin Trudeau with scorn or derision or underestimates him  does so at his own peril   He described Mr  Trudeau as  a man of some consequence  in the same interview   Two months ago  the Government of France awarded Mr  Mulroney the highest civilian honour  At a ceremony at the French Embassy in Ottawa  Nicola Chapuis  the French ambassador presented the former prime minister the insignia of Commander of the National Order of the Legion of Honour for his efforts in promoting France Canada relations and La Francophonie  Mr  Trudeau also attended this ceremony among others   And in early December  Prime Minister Trudeau personally invited Mr  Mulroney at the farewell dinner for outgoing U S  vice president Joe Biden in Ottawa   Meanwhile  veteran Liberal MP Wayne Easter  Malpeque  P E I    chairman of the Canada U S  Inter Parliamentary Group  told The Hill Times that he supports Mr  Trudeau s decision to seek help from Mulroney in promoting the Canada U S  relationship  He said that the Canadian and U S  officials interact at several levels with each other  including Prime Minister to President  cabinet to cabinet  provincial premiers to state governors and parliamentarians to congressmen  He said all these interactions are important to strengthen the relationship between the two countries    It s a great move to bring in other players  This is an issue where partisan self interest shouldn t come into  play    Mr  Easter said   This is about the interest of our economy in Canada and in North America and no one better than Brian Mulroney  who knows President Trump personally  to do what he can to help    arana hilltimes com  The Hill Times",

nicht verlassen  sagte er  seine Karriere sei zerst rt  wenn er nicht in die NHL wechseln d rfe  Er habe sein ganzes Leben lang auf diese Chance gewartet  Da ist uns klargeworden  dass es keinen Sinn
