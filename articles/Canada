Read the list of candidates\n\nWith 14 candidates in the running to replace Stephen Harper, Mr. Ford said the federal Conservative Party is lacking an anti-establishment candidate.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s not a real strong voice for the average person, the blue-collar worker, that\u2019s going to protect them, return their calls, show up to their door when they need help. That\u2019s what people want,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said no one in the federal party, except for the late former finance minister Jim Flaherty, supported the Fords in their campaigns.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a Conservative member, meanwhile the Conservatives never helped Rob and I, and that\u2019s not our base. Our base are NDP voters, Liberal voters,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Ford said his appearance at the annual conference, organized by former Reform Party leader Preston Manning\u2019s Alberta-based organization, will focus on the rise of populist movements such as his brother\u2019s 2010 mayoral victory and U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s election last November, as well as in France, the Netherlands and Poland.\n\nWhen asked if Mr. O\u2019Leary, who only recently joined the party, could be considered the party outsider, Mr. Ford said Mr. O\u2019Leary has never served the public. \u201cThe difference is you have to build your base and Rob worked for 14 years building the base, showing up to little Ms. Jones\u2019s house to pick up her garbage,\u201d he said. \u201cThose people are as loyal as they come.\u201d\n\nMr. Ford said his brother, the controversial mayor who admitted to smoking crack cocaine in office and died last March from cancer, was fond of Mr. Bernier. \u201cHe really liked Bernier. He wanted to meet Bernier and have a chat with him, even when he was sick \u2026 Never got around to doing that.\u201d\n\nMr. Ford said he considers Ms. Leitch a friend, but disagrees with her proposal to screen immigrants for Canadian values.\n\n\u201cWe did so much work building the ethnic community. I believe they\u2019re all fiscal conservatives. Like the majority of us are, we have a social conscience,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Ford also has a history with Ms. Leitch\u2019s former campaign manager, Nick Kouvalis, who served as Rob Ford\u2019s chief of staff in 2011 but left after clashing with Doug Ford. He said he questions whether Mr. Kouvalis, whom Ms. Leitch says is now a volunteer, is still helping the campaign.\n\n\u201cNick believes he\u2019s the smartest guy he knows. So, I don\u2019t see eye to eye with him at all,\u201d Mr. Ford said.\n\nHe also said Mr. Trump\u2019s immigration ban \u201ccould have been handled better,\u201d although he believes the media has blown it out of proportion.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t agree with it because there\u2019s some great people from Somalia that have been here in Canada, contributed to Canada in different ways. Not to mention I had a Muslim brother that lived with us for ten years,\u201d he said, referring to a young man from Morocco who he said lived with his family for ten years.\n\nWhile he may run federally in the future, Mr. Ford said he\u2019ll \u201c100 per cent\u201d run for either municipal or provincial politics in 2018. \u201cYou can count me in,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Ford said he finds it \u201cironic\u201d that he\u2019s speaking on a panel about elites at the Manning Centre conference.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m talking to the establishment, and I\u2019m going to call them out, too. \u2018You guys are the guys that people worry about,\u2019 \u201d he said.\n\nMr. Ford said elites are in all three parties \u2013 the NDP, Liberals and Conservatives.\n\n\u201cThey look down on the average person, they look at you like you\u2019re a Neanderthal and they\u2019re better than you. And a majority of them, excuse my language, they don\u2019t have a pot to piss in and a window to throw it out,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThey think they\u2019re higher and better than the rest of us, and they aren\u2019t.\u201d\n\nReport Typo/Error",

The militant group, Afghanistan's largest, is known to distance itself from attacks on medical facilities or those that result in high civilian casualties.\n\nThe assault comes just a week after 16 people were killed in simultaneous Taliban suicide assaults on two security compounds in Kabul.\n\nDozens of others were wounded as a suicide car bomber struck an Afghan police precinct in western Kabul and a five-hour gun battle ensued after another attacker snuck in.\n\nIn the second attack, a suicide bomber blew himself up at the gates of an Afghan intelligence agency branch in eastern Kabul.\n\nThe growing violence underscores rising insecurity in Afghanistan over the resurgent Taliban.\n\nThe country is bracing for an intense fighting season in the spring as the government's repeated bids to launch peace negotiations with the Taliban have failed.\n\nAfghan forces, already beset by record casualties, desertions and non-existent \u201cghost soldiers\u201d on the payrolls, have been struggling to beat back the Taliban since US-led NATO troops ended their combat mission in December 2014.\n\nKabul last month endorsed U.S. general John Nicholson's call for thousands of additional coalition troops in Afghanistan to fend off the militants before the spring offensive.\n\nExtra troops were needed to end the stalemate in the war, Gen. Nicholson, top U.S. commander in Afghanistan, told the U.S. Congress in what could be President Donald Trump's first major test of military strategy.",

        "body2": "Google Maps via Lakana News and Content graphics department\n\nKABUL, Afghanistan (CNN) - Attackers dressed in medical uniforms stormed a military hospital in the heart of the Afghan capital of Kabul on Wednesday, killing more than 30 people and wounding at least 50, said Dawlat Waziri, spokesman for the Afghan Ministry of Defense.\n\nA suicide bomber set off an explosion at the south gate to the Sardar Mohammed Daud Khan hospital before three gunmen entered the building and made their way to the second and third floors, said Sediq Sediqqi, Afghan Interior Ministry spokesman.\n\nThe gunmen killed and wounded doctors and hospital employees and injured Afghan soldiers, according to an Afghan Defense Ministry statement.\n\nAfghan security forces and police mounted a six-hour siege at the hospital, which is the biggest and best-equipped facility in the country. They killed the attackers around 3:30 p.m. local time (6 a.m. Wednesday ET).\n\nThe facility, known locally as the \"400 bed\" hospital, is located only a few hundred meters from the US embassy and the diplomatic quarter of Kabul. Other recent attacks in Kabul have targeted important public buildings, such as the Afghan Supreme Court and national parliament.\n\nA Taliban spokesman, Zabiullah Mojahid, denied responsibility for the attack in a tweet, saying: \"Today's attack on hospital in Kabul has nothing to do with the Mujahidin of Islamic Emirate,\" using the group's formal name.\n\nIn the vacuum of a Taliban claim, the ISIS-affiliated news agency Amaq said ISIS claimed responsibility for the attack. Although the group usually attacks sectarian targets, it is credible that it planned and carried out the attack. CNN has not independently verified the claim.\n\nExplosions, then gunfire\n\nWitnesses told CNN an explosion was first heard around at 9 a.m. local time (11.30 p.m. Tuesday ET).\n\nAfghan National Police special forces rushed in to counter the attack.\n\n\"At first there was a firing followed by a huge blast,\" an employee at a nearby hospital said.\n\nAn employee at an Italian restaurant nearby said she heard one explosion around 9 a.m., then heard gunfire about 25 minutes later.\n\nThe attackers were not immediately killed because security forces were busy evacuating patients, the defense ministry statement said.\n\nThe injured were taken to the Wazir Akbar Khan hospital, said Smael Kawosi, media relation officer for the Ministry of Health.\n\nAttack condemned\n\nAfghan Chief Executive Abdullah Abdullah condemned the attack.\n\n\"I condemn the terrorist attacked on hospital in Kabul,\" he tweeted. \"While we work for peace, we'll avenge the blood of our people.\"\n\nThe US Embassy in Kabul said, \"Targeting a medical facility providing care for the brave Afghans working to protect their fellow citizens has no possible justification in any religion or creed.\"\n\nNATO forces in Afghanistan indicated that the organization was standing by to assist Afghan security forces, according to tweets from Operation Resolute Support.\n\n\"Once again insurgents show complete disrespect for humanity by attacking a hospital. We stand with Afghan people against terrorism.\"\n\nThe NATO tweets condemned the attack, using an older name for the hospital.\n\nSoft targets\n\nMilitants have long targeted loosely guarded targets in Kabul and across Afghanistan. Last month, at least 20 people died after a suicide blast outside Afghanistan's Supreme Court in Kabul, police and other officials told CNN.\n\nA suicide bomber detonated his explosives in a parking lot near the court in the Afghan capital, according to Basir Mojahid, spokesman for Kabul's chief of police.\n\nEarlier in the year, a spate of attacks -- two suicide bombings near the Afghan Parliament in Kabul, an explosion at a Kandahar province government compound and a suicide bombing in Helmand province -- left dozens of people dead and wounded.\n\nThe Taliban claimed responsibility for the Kabul attacks, which killed at least 36 people and injured 76 others in the capital.\n\nLast summer, seven students, three police officers and two security guards were killed in the attack on the American University of Afghanistan campus in the capital.\n\nPolice searched the university's grounds and killed two attackers who stormed the campus with guns and explosives, Fraidoon Obaidi, chief of Kabul police's criminal investigation department, said. The gunmen detonated explosives and fired guns, witnesses said, causing some students and faculty to flee.",

Dawson said she is satisfied with his answers.\n\nSajjan 'conveying' a decision\n\n\"It appears that Mr. Sajjan was simply conveying a government decision,\" Dawson wrote in a Feb. 27 letter obtained by CBC News. \"Furthermore, I have no information to suggest that Mr. Sajjan actually had any knowledge related to Afghan detainees, nor any involvement in the matter.\"\n\nThe question of what the former Conservative government knew of the alleged torture carried out by local Afghan authorities was at the centre of a number of political crises between 2007 and 2010.\n\nAside from being an important point of international law, the minority government of former prime minister Stephen Harper was almost brought down over its refusal to hand over documents related to the issue.\n\nA pair of human rights groups also fought protracted legal battles to halt the practise of Canadian troops handing suspected Taliban prisoners over to local authorities.\n\nAccording to the commissioner's letter, the minister was not \"involved in the transfer of detainees, nor did he have any knowledge relating to that matter.\"\n\nSajjan told Dawson that he deployed as a reservist and was \"responsible for capacity with the local police forces.\"\n\nAfghanistan's police were not without problems. They were, according to human rights groups, considered among the worst abusers of detainees, next to the National Directorate of Security \u2014 Afghanistan's brutal intelligence service.\n\nEthics Commissioner Mary Dawson says she is satisfied Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan was not involved in the transfer of detainees. (Darren Calabrese/Canadian Press)\n\nThere were multiple reports and media stories during the conflict about the abusive tactics of Afghan police, including allegations from a Canadian soldier that local cops engaged in child abuse.\n\nSajjan told Dawson he was unaware of any abuse and that he and other members of the Forces were under orders to report such a thing, if it occurred.\n\nFurther, he says the Military Police Complaints Commission investigated claims that Canadians knew \u2014 or ought to have known \u2014 about torture in Afghan jails. The same watchdog is currently investigating fresh allegations of rough treatment of prisoners.\n\n\"Mr. Sajjan told me that he did not have any information relevant to the inquiries,\" Dawson wrote.\n\nIn turning down Scott's petition for an inquiry last June, Sajjan said the Liberal government does not believe an independent judicial inquiry is necessary.",

One hospital staff member who was able to get out saw an attacker \"wearing a white coat holding a Kalashnikov and opening fire on everyone, including the guards, patients and doctors\".\n\nOne employee wrote on Facebook: \"Attackers are inside the hospital.

        "body2": "Pakistan is opening its border with Afghanistan for just 48 hours starting today, and only for people. This is too little too late for those who lost over two weeks of their lives stranded at the border, or who depend on regular and legal cross-border transit. In addition, Pakistan is not allowing transit of containerized cargo that is now piling up at the seaport in Karachi on the Arabian Sea and incurring demurrage charges. That containerized cargo is the economic life-blood of Afghanistan, which is landlocked and dependent on Pakistan\u2019s ports. Pakistan should immediately open its border with Afghanistan to legitimate migration and trade.\n\nPakistan claims that it closed the border due to terrorist attacks emanating from Afghanistan. But given that terrorists can use small clandestine trails known as ratlines through the mountains between Pakistan and Afghanistan, and bribe Pakistani border guards along the way, Pakistan\u2019s reasoning rings false. The reality is that Pakistan\u2019s border is porous to terrorists, but not to containerized cargo. So Pakistan is not closing the border to stop terrorism, but rather to put economic pressure on Afghanistan through trade sanctions by another name.\n\nPakistan\u2019s continued border closing to legitimate trade has even given breathing space to terrorism over the past two weeks, because it restricts critical Afghan National Security Force (ANSF) and NATO shipments for counter-terrorism and stability operations. In 2010, at the height of NATO involvement in Afghanistan, NATO depended on Pakistani routes for about 70% of its requirements. In 2010 and 2011, Pakistan cut off NATO supplies to Afghanistan for political leverage. NATO and the ANSF probably continue to get a large percentage of supplies through Pakistan, so the border closure puts a severe strain on Afghan operations against Pakistan-supported Taliban, Haqqani Network, Islamic State, and other terrorists.\n\nThere are plenty of Pakistanis who can lend these terrorists support. A 2015 Pew Survey found that 9% of Pakistanis approve of Islamic State. Another Pew Survey in 2014 found that 8% of Pakistanis approve of the Taliban, and 12% approve of Al Qaeda. Pakistan\u2019s military, which has a hand in supporting these terrorists, is the most popular institution in Pakistan at 87% approval. As Noman Ansari, the editor-in-chief of youth-oriented IGN Pakistan opined in 2015,\n\nWe need to take charge of what we teach in our schools.... We need to counter the extremist narrative in a meaningful way. As I said before, you can\u2019t bomb an ideology. Our belief system begs for reformation at its core, before it is too late.\u201d\n\nWe must stop believing Pakistan\u2019s lies about its border closing, and admit that Pakistan is trying to economically pressure Afghanistan and NATO. This is consistent with its general attempts to restrict trade between its adversary India, and Afghanistan. Pakistan and its ally and largest trade partner China are aggressive, and see democratic countries like the U.S., India, and Afghanistan as strategic competitors. As a result, China\u2019s One Belt One Road (OBOR) has largely sidelined India and Afghanistan in favor of Pakistan.\n\nIndia is a key potential trading partner for Afghanistan, and increased trade between the two democracies could strengthen India and increase Afghanistan\u2019s economic independence from Pakistan. But Pakistan would prefer Afghanistan to be an economic and diplomatic dependency -- strategic depth for its conflict with India.",

        "body0": "Deutsche Bank plans to raise capital, list its asset management business and overhaul its business structure as it tries to reinvent itself after spending two years dealing with its past misdeeds and huge losses.\n\nThe strategic revamp, decided at a supervisory board meeting on Sunday, follows a net loss of 1.4 billion euros last year and is part of the lender's push to draw a line under a string of scandals that have hammered its balance sheet since 2012.\n\nThe decision marks a retreat from a strategy announced less than two years ago when the bank separated its investment banking and markets business, and heralds its fourth capital hike since 2010.\n\n\"On strategy, it's obvious we had a change of heart,\" Chief Executive John Cryan said on a call with journalists on Sunday afternoon.\n\n\"These measures will make Deutsche Bank stronger and place us back firmly on a path to sustainable growth.\"\n\nDeutsche ( db ) plans to launch an 8 billion euro ($8.5 billion) rights issue of 687.5 million new shares on March 21, priced at around a 39% discount to Friday's closing price of 19.14 euros.\n\nThe bank said it also plans to list a minority stake in its asset management business and sell off other assets to raise a further 2 billion euros which, with the rights issue, should take its capital ratio above 13%.\n\nDeutsche will reunite its cash cow securities trading unit and corporate finance business under one roof, having separated them in 2015. The bank said those divisions, which will be combined with its transaction banking group, will now focus predominantly on serving corporate clients and less on institutional ones such as pension and hedge funds.\n\nIn another about-face, the lender scrapped plans to sell its Postbank unit, saying it was unable to do so at an acceptable price. Instead, it now wants to reintegrate the operation into its other German retail business.\n\n\"We are very positive over prospects of banking in Germany,\" Cryan said.\n\nThose measures mean the bank will have just three business divisions going forward: a private and commercial bank focused on Germany, a corporate and investment bank, and its asset management business.\n\nDeutsche will promote retail banking head Christian Sewing and finance head Markus Schenck to oversee the revamp as co-deputy CEOs alongside Cryan.\n\nSchenck will also become co-head of the investment bank alongside Garth Ritchie, who currently heads the bank's bond and equities trading activities. Jeffrey Urwin, head of corporate and investment banking, is expected to step down later this year.\n\nLagging Behind\n\nWhile litigation costs and writedowns on past acquisitions have weighed on Deutsche Bank's earnings, it has also fallen behind its Wall Street rivals, lagging their strong fourth quarter rebound in bond trading for instance.\n\nIt has spent the past 18 months trimming down its product offering, throwing out unprofitable clients and trying to get its convoluted information technology into better shape.\n\nHowever the $7.2 billion settlement it reached with the U.S. Department of Justice in December for selling toxic mortgage backed securities and its struggling markets business meant Deutsche Bank needed more radical action to bolster its balance sheet.\n\nThe coming couple of months are seen as a good window by bankers for it to raise cash, coming ahead of France's presidential election in May and at a time when stock markets are at record highs.\n\nDeutsche is likely to have taken heart from the success of rival UniCredit's capital hike last month, when it raised 13 billion euros in Italy's biggest ever rights issue.\n\nA regulatory source said there had been no pressure from regulators on Deutsche Bank to raise capital and that it appeared to be a strategic decision.\n\nMany of the bank's investors see it as a necessary move despite the billions already plowed into the bank in the past seven years. Since 2010 Deutsche Bank has raised more than 20 billion euros in fresh capital, yet its market value stands at just 26.4 billion.\n\n\"The announced measures are an important signal for the capital market that the bank is now focusing more on its future and its customers after years of dealing with the past,\" fund manager Ingo Speich at Union Investment said.\n\nA person close to Qatar, Deutsche Bank's largest shareholder with a stake of just below 10%, agreed.\n\n\"The fact that they are doing a capital raising is no surprise. It has been rumored for long. The sale of a minority stake in the asset management is something in the right direction,\" the source said.\n\nCryan said that the bank did talk about the rights issue with one of Deutsche Bank's major shareholders and was told the shareholder would take up its subscription rights.\n\nDeutsche Bank shares have recovered from a record low of 9.90 euros last autumn, but are still down a third from the time Cryan took office in July 2015. They trade at less than half of Deutsche Bank's book value, placing the lender among the 10 weakest banks in Europe and far off the peer average of just below book value.\n\nThe rights issue is initially being underwritten by Credit Suisse, Barclays, Goldman Sachs , BNP Paribas, Commerzbank, HSBC, Morgan Stanley and UniCredit.",

The Canadiens outshot the Canucks 38-28.\n\nTorrey Mitchell scored in the first period for the Canadiens and Michael Chaput scored for the Canucks in the third period.\n\nThe Canadiens increased their lead to six points over the second-place Ottawa Senators in the Atlantic Division. Ottawa holds three games in hand.\n\nMitchell ends long slump: The Canadiens went more than three minutes before getting their first shot on goal by Galchenyuk, but Mitchell opened the scoring shortly after when he deflected a point shot from Andrei Markov behind goalie Ryan Miller at 3:57 of the first period. Mitchell had gone 39 games without a goal. The last time Mitchell scored was Dec. 8 when he had two goals against the New Jersey Devils at the Bell Centre. The Greenfield Park native, who had five goals in the first 10 games, now has eight for the season. The Canucks outshot the Canadiens 11-10 in the first period.\n\nClose call for Gally: There was no scoring in the second period, but Brendan Gallagher had the best chance for the Canadiens when he broke in alone on Miller with 2:35 remaining in the period and the goalie made a real nice glove stop. The Canadiens dominated the period, outshooting the Canucks 16-4.\n\nChaput ties it up: Chaput tied it up for the Canucks at the 12:49 mark of the third period when he was left alone in front of Price and deflected a point shot by Alexander Edler. It was the 23rd shot of the game for the Canucks. Chaput snuck in behind the defence pair of Jeff Petry and Brandon Davidson. The shots on goal were 37-28 for the Canadiens after three periods.\n\nHabs debut for Davidson: Davidson made his Canadiens debut after being acquired from the Edmonton Oilers last week in exchange for David Desharnais. Alexei Emelin, who has struggled recently, was made a healthy scratch. The Canadiens were also without Alexander Radulov (lower-body injury) for the second straight game and Tomas Plekanec (upper-body injury). Plekanec had played in a team-leading 236 consecutive games dating back to March 29, 2014. Brian Flynn suffered an upper-body injury during the first period and didn\u2019t return.\n\n\u201cGo, Habs, Go!\u201d: It was almost like a home game for the Canadiens with all the Habs sweaters in the house and chants of \u201cGo, Habs, Go!\u201d and \u201cCa-rey! Ca-rey!\u201d breaking out throughout the game. It can\u2019t be easy for the home team when that happens in their own rink. What\u2019s that again about the Maple Leafs being Canada\u2019s team?\n\nWhat\u2019s next: The Canadiens flew to Calgary after the game. They have a practice scheduled for Wednesday afternoon at the Saddledome and will play the Flames Thursday night (9 p.m., SNE, RDS, TSN Radio 690). The Canadiens will enjoy an off day Friday in Edmonton, practise Saturday at Rogers Place and then wrap up their Western Canada trip Sunday against the Oilers (7 p.m., SN, RDS, TSN Radio 690).\n\nscowan@postmedia.com\n\ntwitter.com/StuCowan1",

On a un bel effort du premier au quatri\u00e8me trio. \u00bb\n\nPrice brille devant les siens\n\nMiller aurait certainement m\u00e9rit\u00e9 meilleur sort, mais la bataille des gardiens a encore une fois tourn\u00e9 en faveur du Montr\u00e9alais d'adoption.\n\nLe gardien des Canucks, nomm\u00e9 troisi\u00e8me \u00e9toile de la soir\u00e9e, s'est illustr\u00e9 avec un total de 36 arr\u00eats. Price a repouss\u00e9 27 tirs, mais n'a rien pu faire lorsque Michael Chaput a \u00e0 son tour redirig\u00e9 une frappe d'un co\u00e9quipier pour inscrire un but.\n\nLa r\u00e9ussite du Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois a \u00e9t\u00e9 obtenue \u00e0 mi-chemin du troisi\u00e8me vingt.\n\nAuparavant, Price s'\u00e9tait signal\u00e9 devant Nikolay Goldobin, seul devant lui au premier engagement, avant de voler un but \u00e0 Markus Granlund oubli\u00e9 dans l'enclave qui s'y est pris \u00e0 deux fois.\n\nSon entra\u00eeneur \u00e9tait dithyrambique.\n\n\u00ab Je disais wow quand je l\u2019avais aux olympiques et avec \u00c9quipe Canada, mais l\u00e0 j'ai la chance de dire wow plus souvent \u00bb, s'est exclam\u00e9 Julien.\n\nPrice a accord\u00e9 un seul but en deux rencontres et 70 lancers contre l'\u00e9quipe de sa province natale cette saison, ce qui repr\u00e9sente un taux d'efficacit\u00e9 de ,986.\n\nOn entendait d'ailleurs des chants acclamer ses louanges dans les gradins du Rogers Arena.\n\nC'est du grand Price. On joue bien d\u00e9fensivement aussi, les attaquants se replient, mais Pricey (Carey Price) fait des arr\u00eats cl\u00e9s, des arr\u00eats incroyables pour nous. Phillip Danault\n\nLe Tricolore augmente donc \u00e0 six sa s\u00e9rie victorieuse, une premi\u00e8re s\u00e9quence du genre depuis celle de huit gains qui a pris fin le 2 novembre contre\u2026 les Canucks.\n\n\u00c0 mi-chemin d'un voyage de quatre rencontres loin du Centre Bell, le Canadien affiche un rendement immacul\u00e9 de 2-0. Les deux prochains rendez-vous auront lieu jeudi \u00e0 Calgary et dimanche \u00e0 Edmonton.\n\nTorrey Mitchell sort de sa l\u00e9thargie\n\nTrente-neuf matchs sans marquer, c'est long. Torrey Mitchell a chass\u00e9 sa guigne d'une demi-saison pour lancer le Canadien en avant 1-0 en premi\u00e8re p\u00e9riode. Mitchell a fait d\u00e9vier un tir faible de la pointe d'Andrei Markov pour d\u00e9jouer Miller.\n\nMalchanceux, l'attaquant de Greenfield Park est rentr\u00e9 au vestiaire peu de temps apr\u00e8s sa r\u00e9ussite, tout comme Bryan Flynn, et le CH a d\u00fb se d\u00e9brouiller \u00e0 10 attaquants pour le reste de la p\u00e9riode initiale.\n\nMitchell est revenu au jeu au d\u00e9but du deuxi\u00e8me engagement, tandis que le Canadien confirmait la blessure au haut du corps de Flynn, qui a \u00e9t\u00e9 absent pour le reste du match.\n\nPar ailleurs, le Tricolore n'a pas su profiter de ses trois avantages num\u00e9riques.\n\nUne premi\u00e8re audition r\u00e9ussie pour Brandon Davidson\n\n\u00c0 son premier match avec son nouveau club, Davidson a jou\u00e9 14 min 40 s, a obtenu deux lancers et a termin\u00e9 la rencontre \u00e0 -1.\n\nClaude Julien s'est malgr\u00e9 tout dit satisfait de sa prestation.\n\nCe voyage tombe \u00e0 point a ajout\u00e9 le pilote du Tricolore.\n\n\u00ab Il semble avoir une meilleure chimie. On a un bon voyage pr\u00e9sentement qui a bien d\u00e9but\u00e9 avec beaucoup de nouveaux joueurs. Le temps qu\u2019on passe ensemble est du temps pr\u00e9cieux \u00e0 ce stade-ci de la saison pour apprendre \u00e0 se conna\u00eetre plus rapidement \u00bb, a conclu Julien.",

It fell to Mavericks owner Mark Cuban to espouse the greatness of Dirk, which granted he has done for the better part of two decades. (Even then, though, Cuban extolling Nowitzki\u2019s legend almost always turned into a story about Cuban, because any story involving Cuban in any way turns into a story about Cuban.)\n\nIt\u2019s a shame too, because if you look at the modern game, it\u2019s hard to think of anyone more influential than Nowitzki. He was a stretch four before stretch fours existed. He created the modern prototype for a power forward, and while it took the league some time, they all caught up.\n\n/\n\nKevin Jairaj-USA TODAY Sports",

        "body2": "DALLAS \u2013 The outcome seemed as inevitable as Dirk Nowitzki sinking a fadeaway jumper.\n\nThe Lakers suffered a 122-111 loss to the Dallas Mavericks on Tuesday at American Airlines Center, marking their eighth consecutive loss overall and the fourth consecutive year they were swept by the Mavericks in the regular-season series.\n\nAfterward, Lakers coach Luke Walton echoed a criticism former Lakers coach Byron Scott often had last season when he called the team \u201csoft.\u201d\n\n\u201cTeams feel like when they play us right now, we\u2019re kind of a soft team that they can come in to get their offensive numbers against,\u201d Walton said. \u201cThat\u2019s got to be up to us to change that.\u201d\n\nWalton expressed optimism the Lakers (19-45) will eventually do that. On Tuesday, he and his players seemed resigned to becoming a footnote on Nowitzki\u2019s record-setting night in which the German-born forward became the sixth player in NBA history to score at least 30,000 points.\n\nNowitzki scored 18 of the 20 points he needed to reach the milestone in the first quarter. He became the first international member of an elite club occupied by Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Karl Malone, Kobe Bryant, Michael Jordan and Wilt Chamberlain, finishing with a team-high 25 points on 9-of-13 shooting.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re upset it happens against you as a team,\u201d said Walton, who was a player when Nowitzki became the 34th player in league history to score 20,000 points on Jan. 13, 2010 against the Lakers. \u201cThat looked like young Dirk. Those balls weren\u2019t even touching the rim. He\u2019s got 30,000 points for a reason.\u201d\n\nNowitzki reached the mark after nailing a step-back baseline jumper over Lakers reserve forward Larry Nance Jr. for a 42-30 lead with 10:57 left in the second quarter. After Nowitzki added a 25-foot 3-pointer, the Lakers called timeout at the 9:53 mark, setting up the Mavericks to play a video tribute to their 38-year-old future Hall of Famer.\n\nThe 7-footer, in his 19th season, joins Malone and Bryant as the third player to score at least 30,000 points with one team. Nowitzki hit his first six shots and finished the first half 9 for 12 from the field, 3 for 3 from beyond the arc and 4 for 4 on free throws.\n\n\u201cI happened to be who he crossed the line on, but there\u2019s a lot of other games between me and that first point,\u201d said Nance, who said he felt fine playing through a recently sprained right wrist. \u201cI\u2019m not worried about it. I played solid defense. But Dirk is Dirk. There\u2019s a reason he has 30,000 points. He\u2019s a 7-footer leaning back that can shoot. Good luck.\u201d\n\nThe Lakers, who lost here by 49 points in February, couldn't help but improve upon that outing but provided no highlights worthy of their own video tribute.\n\nThe rest of Dallas\u2019 starters scored in double figures: Seth Curry (18), Yogi Ferrell (16), Wesley Mathews (15) and Harrison Barnes (14).\n\nThe Lakers were led by D\u2019Angelo Russell (22 points, four assists), Jordan Clarkson (22 points), Brandon Ingram (13 points), Nick Young (13 points) and Julius Randle (13 points, 18 rebounds, 10 assists). Randle also became the second youngest player in Lakers history behind Magic Johnson to have three triple-doubles in a season, but that meant little with the Lakers allowing 46 points in the paint and allowing Dallas to shoot 17-of-31 from 3-point range.\n\nHence, Walton questioned the team\u2019s toughness.\n\n\u201cIt (ticks) me off. We\u2019re not soft,\u201d Randle said. \u201cBut we\u2019re not the aggressor. When we\u2019re the aggressive team, we give ourselves chances to win. When we\u2019re not the aggressors, teams have confidence.\u201d\n\nContact the writer: mmedina@scng.com",
