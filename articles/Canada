        "body0": "Makayla McWatch can clearly remember the first time she drank water from a tap at home  For the 12 year old  it only came last summer    My mom told me there's this fresh water we could drink  And I was like  'What '  she recalls   I turned on the tap  and I had a cup  and put  water  in a cup   and it was so clear    McWatch lives on Pic Mobert First Nation  a semi remote community 350 kilometres northwest of Sault Ste  Marie  Ont   that was under a boil water advisory for 10 years   Up until last year  she had no memory of drinking water straight from the tap   She can remember  however  what she experienced when she turned on the faucet   It smelled like when you leave something out for a couple of days   It smells really rotten and stuff    Makayla McWatch  12  said before a new water treatment plant opened in Pic Mobert First Nation last June  the tap water she used to take baths and showers in was often brown and had a bad smell   Margo McDiarmid CBC   Pic Mobert is one of 18 Indigenous communities that got off the federal government's long term drinking water list last year   a designation given to those that have had advisories in place for more than a year   At the same time  12 more communities were added to the list   'Everybody thinks everyone has drinkable water  that you could just turn on a tap and it's there  That's not the reality '   Resident Jessy Sabourin  According to Indigenous and Northern Affairs Canada  a total of 71 Indigenous communities across Canada are currently unable to drink their tap water   Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's government has promised to get all Indigenous communities off boil water advisories by 2021  a pledge first made during the 2015 election   Pic Mobert's situation changed thanks to a state of the art water treatment plant that opened last June in the community of 350  But Chief Wayne Sabourin points out that council started the process much earlier  in 2008   The federal government put in about  13 million and the community contributed  61 000    It's awesome  it's the greatest thing  You get excited over simple things that other Canadians always had   says Sabourin   That's how we feel in the community now    Concerns remain  Yet in spite of that excitement  Sabourin says Pic Mobert now faces new challenges    I don't know what it's going to cost to operate our plant   he says   Is the federal government setting us up to fail because they're not giving us enough operation and maintenance to operate these plants    Chief Wayne Sabourin says getting a water treatment plant was one of the biggest challenges his community faced  with the process beginning in 2008   Victor Modderman CBC    Unlike municipalities  which use property taxes to fund a large portion of their operating budgets  Pic Mobert has no tax base because the band owns all of the homes in the community    Maybe we increase the rent and take a piece of that rent   says Sabourin   But we struggle to pay rent because we have 60 per cent unemployment    The chief wants independence for his community  but says he feels like his hands are tied  he says increased regular federal funds will be required to keep the plant going   Looking to the future  Pic Mobert's water treatment plant requires one full time manager and two operators   currently trainees   to run it   Trainee Orville McWatch Jr  grew up in Pic Mobert  and says he's proud to help his friends and family gain access to clean drinking water    I'm training to be a class one  and eventually  a class two operator to take care of this place   he says   Orville McWatch Jr  grew up in Pic Mobert First Nation  He's training to be an operator at the new water treatment plant  McWatch would like to run the plant one day but has concerns about wages  as he knows other plants can offer him more   Margo McDiarmid CBC   The 36 year old says as a class one operator  he'll earn  20 an hour in Pic Mobert  But he knows if he worked in the neighbouring town  he could make  28 an hour    Obviously I want to stay  It's my community I want to help my community  Keep my family here  live here  grow up here  eventually maybe retire here   says McWatch   But it's the wage that could possibly stop me from doing that    Plant manager Dave Craig knows his trainees will struggle with wage issues  Craig has worked at several plants across northern Ontario for more than two decades    It's hard to find people   a lot of places in the north  it was really hard to keep operators   he says   Turnover was amazing    Before Pic Mobert's treatment plant was in operation  the community relied on two small pumphouses to pull and filter the water  with workers bottling and delivering around 40 to 50 large  20 litre bottles each day   After a decade of not trusting the taps  Craig says the transition to the new plant was initially met with some resistance    It was a tough go at first  a few people demanded bottled water   he says   But we broke the news to them that we were  previously  bottling it right here and it was the same water    Taking water for granted  Jessy Sabourin  a mother of five  says the new treatment plant has changed her life   Before the plant opened  her family relied on the deliveries of those large water jugs for everyday use   including bathing  She recalls how she was called to the school  many times  to pick up her kids after they developed rashes  At one point  her son had impetigo    When  the children  were babies   we'd warm up the jug water because we didn't really trust the tap water   says Sabourin   Now with the new water I haven't had no skin rash problems or nothing    The majority of Canadians take their running water for granted  she says    Everybody thinks everyone has drinkable water  that you could just turn on a tap and it's there   she says   That's not the reality    Pic Mobert First Nation is a northern Ontario community with 350 residents  The semi remote community sits on White River  the source of its drinking water   Margo McDiarmid CBC   Questions about timeline  In its last budget  the government committed  1 8 billion over five years to building new on reserve water infrastructure across Canada  But a recent report questioned if the plan   and its timeline   is realistic   Given what Pic Mobert First Nation had to go through  Chief Sabourin also has his doubts    To be honest  I can't see it  It's a pipe dream  I would say it would be 10 to 15  maybe 20 years before you see this all completed   he says   That's if they're persistent and putting money toward it    Indigenous Affairs Minister Carolyn Bennett says the federal government is committed to the five year target    I don't think you get anywhere without having a hard target   and this is our hard target   she told CBC News   We are measuring as we go  We will get there because it's so important as a commitment to equality of life  ",

        "body2": "It s the only debate that you hear more often around the Saddledome than popcorn versus nachos   Is Sam Bennett best suited for centre or the wing   Among the masses  many figure that Bennett   the highest draft pick in Calgary Flames franchise history  a spring surprise in the 2015 Stanley Cup playoffs and now a snake bitten sophomore   has delivered his best work during stretches of deployment on the left side   The decision makers  however  remain committed to developing No  93 as a middle man    I don t have a preference   Bennett insisted prior to the Flames  bye   I m comfortable in both positions and I can play both positions  It doesn t really matter to me  I don t know if I am a better centre or better winger    The 20 year old might be the only yahoo in Cowtown without an opinion on that particular subject   Bennett patrolled the port side for about two thirds of his freshman campaign before being shifted to centre last February  With the exception of a stint on the wing while star lefty Johnny Gaudreau recovered from a broken finger  he s been skating at the pivotal position ever since   That s where the Flames envision him for the next decade and then some  This is still the down payment period  and it ain t always cheap    It s much more difficult to play centre than it is the wing  with the responsibilities that go along with the position on both sides   stressed Flames general manager Brad Treliving  who called Bennett s name with the fourth overall selection in 2014   I don t care which team you play for or which system or anything like that  but especially in how we play and the responsibilities to be down low  it s a taxing position    Which explains why Bennett  early in his big league career  has often looked better as a flank    Do I think young players that are centremen like Sam  are they more effective at wing early on in the NHL  Yeah  I do  if you can get a good veteran presence with them   said Flames head coach Glen Gulutzan   But if you put them in the right spot  they can develop their skill set at centre  too  So it s a little bit of a balancing act with a young player    It s a lot harder to develop a winger and then say   Oh  by the way  we need you to play 40 games at centre   It s like the pickle and the cucumber  right  You can turn a cucumber into a pickle  but once you ve got a pickle  you can t make it into a cucumber    Right now  he s finding his way  If we have to put him on the wing at some time  we would  but we re trying to develop him  He s going to be a good two way centre  He is already  He s been able to hold his own both ways  so I d rather be able to move a centre to wing at some point than try to make him a winger and then move him back to the centre position    Of course  you don t want to spoil the cucumber either    It s all about slotting   Gulutzan said   If you slot him up into the first line hole and say   Ok  you ve got Joe Thornton tonight  you ve got  Ryan  Getzlaf tomorrow  you ve got  Anze  Kopitar the next night and then you re going to come back against  Jonathan  Toews   well there could be some regression there because he s a young guy playing against established  top of their class players    But if you slot him in the right place  you can develop in the right areas so that eventually   and I believe this   he ll be able to play against top guys night in and night out  But there are not too many 20 year olds yet that can    Truth is  not many 20 year olds are playing centre  period  in the NHL  although there is a kid in Edmonton   the guy who wears No  97 on his sweater and is currently tied for tops in the league wide scoring race   making it look way too easy    You can go back in history and study how difficult it is for guys to come in at young ages and have a whole lot of success right off the bat  It s a short list   Treliving said   So we re being real patient with  Bennett   We think the world of him  And he s shown it at times over the course of the last couple of years   he gives you a glimpse of what he can be    But he s a young man playing in a hard league and at a difficult position  So I think we all have to take a deep breath here  You have to invest in it  It s not going to happen just because you hope it happens  There has to be a period of investment  There has to be a period of patience    We want to them to be 26 years old and perfect right away  That s not how it works    Bennett is certainly experiencing some growing pains   Between Dec  4 to Feb  1  he spanned more than eight weeks   a stretch of 23 appearances and one healthy scratching   without collecting a single assist  When you consider how often a centre touches the puck  that s hard to fathom   He has just one marker in 16 games since the calendar was flipped to 2017  and that was a meaningless lamp lighting with 1 1 ticks left on the clock in a lopsided loss to the Montreal Canadiens   All told  Bennett has 10 goals and 10 assists in 55 contests so far as a sophomore  He had 18 of each last winter  with the majority of that production coming off the left wing   Bennett s 46 1  success rate this season at the face off dot is the worst mark among the Flames usual middle men  but it s slightly better than his minor hockey chum Connor McDavid  proof the Edmonton Oilers  aforementioned wunderkind hasn t yet mastered every aspect of the position    When you look at Sam  what are his attributes that make you believe he s going to be a good centre   said Treliving  repeating the question before rolling out a detailed response   Well  first of all  he has good speed  great quickness  He plays with tempo in his game  To me  he s a driver  What I mean by that is he s an attacker  He attacks seams  He can push defencemen back  He takes pucks to the net  His is an abrasive game  It s a north south game  It s not necessarily one where there s a lot of east west into it  Sam  he s a direct player    And then he has the ability to make plays  He has good vision  He can distribute the puck  He can shoot the puck  He can do a lot of things  And subtly  and people might not see this  he s starting to expand his role  He s seeing penalty killing time  And not only is that good in terms of the immediate  because he s doing a good job at it   But also it s a way to continue to build that defensive side of his game    Because the Flames aren t simply trying to develop a centre   They re trying to develop a top tier  two way centre    You look at the teams that win and have won consistently  we all want those guys that put up big points and I think Sam is very capable of that   Treliving said   But those teams that have sustained success down the middle  and we hear it all the time  but those centres play 200 feet  Yeah  they contribute offensively  But it s that growth that a lot of them have gone through to maybe take a little step back from their point production and their game is a more solid game  They re contributing more on both sides of the puck  Maybe individually  it s going from 80 points to 65 points  But it s a hard 65 points and it s a 200 foot game and it s getting the puck out at the right time    Look at  Anze  Kopitar as an example   and that s just an example  I m not comparing players  You can go back in time to the  Mike  Modanos and  Steve  Yzermans  guys that put up big numbers at parts of their careers but when you look at when their teams won  they had also evolved their game into guys that were playing against top players  They weren t just offensive players  They were playing against top lines  They were killing penalties  They were doing it on both sides of the puck  and they were doing it in a way that their teams were winning and playing late into June and winning Stanley Cups    That s taking it two or three steps forward  but that s the mindset here   Treliving continued   That s part of the maturation and growth all players will go through but when we talk about Sam specifically  that s where we see his game growing  He s an elite competitor  He has all the attributes that can make him a very strong centre  and we re going to continue to work at it    A person that is able to play that position  they are so hard to find  So when you think you can develop one  you want to exhaust that opportunity

        "body0": "FADEL SENNA AFP Getty Images  If Sinbad and Ike Turner had a child of great talent and potential who d ultimately squander both due to his issues with anger and maybe some matters that recall the D A R E  program  he d look and aggressively dance a lot like Chris Brown     Advertisement  Chris Brown is the R B equivalent of the kin you ve rooted for but decided to let go of as you ve finally accepted that they may be in the HOV lane to the crossroads  Due to his celebrity though  Chris Brown will never truly go away  Still  with his most recent disturbing headline  it s time to internalize En Vogue s  Give It Up  Turn It Loose   We ll always have  Yo  Excuse Me Miss     Take You Down    Damage  and  Fine China   but for those who continue to hold out hope that Brown will rise above his problems  it s time to pop  lock and drop into reality   On Tuesday  TMZ reported that Brown s former girlfriend Karrueche Tran filed legal documents accusing Brown of threatening to kill her  Additionally  Tran claims that Brown has physically assaulted her in the past  And suddenly I now want to get up and do Soulja Boy s Superman dance   Advertisement  Per TMZ   Karrueche claims in a sworn statement to the judge  earlier this month Chris  told a few people that he was going to kill me   She then says Chris told the friends if he can t have her then no one else can  threatening he was going to  take me out  and  threatened to shoot me   Karrueche also says several years ago Chris  punched me in my stomach twice   and  pushed me down the stairs   This would have been during the time Chris was on probation for the Rihanna beating   Tran also claims that Brown has threatened her friends and recently threw a drink at one of them  So  not only is this man Light Bright Ike  he s part time vintage Evelyn Lozada from Basketball Wives   In any case  the judge granted said domestic violence restraining order  requiring Brown to stay 100 yards away from Tran  her mom and her brother   Sponsored  In response  Brown took to Instagram to try to clear his name while simultaneously confirming your worst suspicions about his state of mind as he rambled rather incoherently  Forgoing a publicist and lawyer  Brown said   Make sure y all don t be listening to all this bullshit man  I don t know what the fuck they re talking about  Don t believe all that bullshit  bro    His comments might have come across as more convincing had he not delivered them in a manner that recalls a kite flying high in the clear blue sky     Advertisement  Advertisement  Of the many problems Chris Brown has  one in particular is his unfortunate habit of documenting his bad decisions and erratic behavior for all to see  Less than a month ago  Brown took to Al Gore s internet and recorded himself sounding like the very violent menace his ex girlfriend is accusing him to be  Do people not realize that when it comes to sharing videos on the internet that 1  we can see you and 2  the internet is forever   In that now infamous clip in which he looked like the lost cousin of Kris Kross  Brown said     Ladies y all be complaining about niggas being like stalkers  in love with y all  kinda crazy shit  and get tired of  em  Well guess what  I m one of them niggas  If I love you  bitch  ain t nobody gon  have ya  I mma make ya miserable  I mma chase that nigga out  I mma chase yo ass around  Ladies  y all ever dealt with a nigga who just be blowin  your shit up  Hopping gates  stalking the fuck out of you  getting on your nerves  Well  shit  I m one of them niggas   And now he is being accused of not only additional physical abuse years after he beat another former girlfriend  Rihanna  but of living up to the very abusive stalker he boldly professed himself to be on camera   Advertisement  For years now  fans and other sympathizers have rallied behind Chris Brown  Some have made excuses for his behavior  In many cases  it was a matter of victim blaming though  in others  Brown having witnessed domestic violence as a child was cited as a reason to hold out hope that he would one day get himself together  That he would own his mistakes and ultimately overcome whatever internal demons and the childhood trauma that helped create them     But as someone who is not unfamiliar with some of what Brown has spoken of previously  there comes a point when you realize that some people are simply stuck  Maybe critics self included were too harsh on him  Perhaps more people needed to give him a chance to redeem himself  There were instances in which it seemed as if Chris Brown was damned if he did  damned if he didn t     Nevertheless  Brown has largely been the maker of his own madness   Advertisement  Advertisement  Chris Brown never let go of the misogyny  In fact  he continued to profit from it in his music  Chris Brown remained defensive more often than not about his repeating the very cycle of abuse he was exposed to as a kid  Chris Brown never stopped battling people  be it online or in person  Chris Brown has exhibited violence for several years   Chris Brown is a man of means  he has refused to use his blessings to become a better  happier and less terrorizing man  Chris Brown can call Karrueche Tran s accusations  bullshit   but he s given us countless examples of why we should believe every single thing she told that judge  Even now  I can recall the sight of Brown following Tran outside of a club in 2015 which at the time was reported to have resulted in an argument     Look at him  Look at her  Look at the fear in her eyes  Look at the traits of an abuser on full display without the slightest sign of shame   I don t know what will become of Chris Brown  but I do know that not a song in the world can excuse him anymore  Whatever emotional attachment people have to him because of his work  it is not enough when considering that he is on camera boasting about stalking someone for no other reason than her rightly deciding that he doesn t deserve her   Advertisement  Chris Brown s debut album was released in 2005  We learned he beat women in 2009  Seven years later  he s being accused of the same thing  and throughout these seven years  he has shown himself to be more like Eddie from The Five Heartbeats than Michael from the Jackson 5  Let him go     If anything  now is the time to focus less on Chris Brown s dedication to self destruction and more on the havoc he brings to others who enter his space   ",
