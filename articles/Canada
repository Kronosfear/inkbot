        "body1": "London  Harry Kane hit a first half hat trick as Tottenham stormed up to second in the Premier League with a 4 0 home demolition of Stoke on Sunday  Kane's treble took his tally to 17 league goals this season  while his first of the day at White Hart Lane was his 100th club goal   The England forward  23  who also scored three against Fulham in the FA Cup a week ago  capped an outstanding all round display by setting up Dele Alli for the fourth  That helped Alli to draw a line under his dismissal against Gent that contributed to Spurs' Europa League exit on Thursday   Tottenham's victory took them above Manchester City and closed the gap on runaway leaders Chelsea to 10 points  The damaging failure to beat Gent marked the latest disappointment for Spurs in a frustrating month that also saw their title challenge fade significantly   The challenge confronting Mauricio Pochettino's side was to produce a performance and result that would help put the midweek embarrassment behind them  It quickly became clear this game would provide the ideal platform for Spurs and Alli to redeem themselves after a testing 72 hours of soul searching   Within three minutes  Christian Eriksen had flashed a shot across the face of goal  provoking an angry reaction from Pochettino  who was infuriated at the Dane's failure to pick out a better placed teammate  The manager need not have worried  Stoke could barely manage to rouse themselves and after Joe Allen hit the side netting for the visitors  Kane produced the 14th minute opening goal that put the home side firmly in control   The chance came when Stoke's Ryan Shawcross failed to clear Eriksen s threaded pass  but Kane s finish was ruthless  with the striker latching onto the loose ball and producing a first time shot that flew across keeper Lee Grant  The technique Kane demonstrated in claiming his second in the 32nd minute was even better   Eriksen's right wing corner was played out to Kane  who had positioned himself on the edge of the area  where he hit the bouncing ball on the full  left footed  inside Grant's right hand post   Prior to that  Stoke threatened when Peter Crouch slid in to meet Erik Pieters' low cross  only to be denied by the boot of Spurs Keeper Hugo Lloris  while Charlie Adam collected a booking for a foul on Alli  But their response quickly faded and Tottenham's third came when Adam again fouled Alli to concede a free kick 30 yards out   Eriksen rolled the ball to Kane  whose low shot deflected off the defensive wall  wrong footing Grant and securing the striker's hat trick   Stoke boss Mark Hughes was clearly angered by his side's display but worse was to come in first half stoppage time when Kane out paced Bruno Martins Indi on the right and burst into the box before squaring for Alli  who slid in for the fourth   Injury to Toby Alderweireld at the start of the second half provided Spurs' first setback of the game  while the sight of Kane colliding with a post was also a momentary cause for concern   That aside  the only frustration for Spurs and Kane was that they failed to add to their first half tally  with Grant producing an excellent save to deny the striker his fourth goal ", 
        "body0": "Lads  it s Stoke City  After the embarrassing exit from the Europa League on Thursday  Tottenham Hotspur eased back into Premier League action by thrashing their most submissive opponents  Mauricio Pochettino s team had beaten Stoke 4 0 in their two previous meetings and it took only one half for them to reach that score here  as Harry Kane struck three goals before inviting Dele Alli to hit another  If Wembley spooks Spurs  the sight of Stoke City jerseys cheers them right up   Spurs  in fairness  have clobbered most opponents at White Hart Lane this season  their tally for the Premier League campaign now standing at 11 wins and two draws from 13 matches  But few visitors have been as obliging as Stoke  who  seemingly unrefreshed by a break in Dubai began as if expecting another trouncing  That was a self fulfilling attitude that made them ideal opponents for a Spurs team eager to reassert their top team credentials after flopping out of Europe at Wembley   Tottenham Hotspur v Stoke City  Premier League   as it happened Read more   We never really got out of the traps   admitted Mark Hughes   We talked about having a bright start but that didn t materialise for us  Unfortunately we were a little bit too passive  At times we were just a little bit awestruck and had a little bit too much respect for them  Maybe some of the players had scars from the previous performances  against Spurs  but they shouldn t have because we have been in good form recently    The first sign of Stoke docility came in only the fourth minute  when Christian Eriksen nutmegged Ryan Shawcross in the box and rolled the ball across the face of goal  Fortunately for Stoke there was no Tottenham player there to complete a tap in but it was not long before Spurs players were infiltrating the area in swarms  Shawcross  for years the most formidable of sentinels for Stoke  was particularly discombobulated and Spurs  opening goal was a result of his confusion  As the defender tried to tidy up following another incursion by Eriksen in the 14th minute  Kane nicked the ball off him and lashed in a low shot from 15 yards   Stoke attempted to stammer a retort and  in fairness  presented a cogent argument in the 24th minute in the form of a flowing move down the left involving Ramadan Sobhi and Erik Pieters  Peter Crouch nearly topped that off with a telling finish from four yards but Hugo Lloris had the last word with a superb save   If that had gone in it might have stirred us from our slumbers   Hughes said  Spurs then settled the debate for good   Jan Vertonghen fired a shot against the crossbar following a corner by Eriksen  Moments later Kane was more clinical  His second goal came courtesy of a perfectly executed half volley from the edge of the area following an outswinging corner by Eriksen  The striker raised his left leg with the grace of a ballerina and then brought it cracking down like a lion tamer s whip as he sent a fierce and impeccably controlled low shot into the net   Manchester United v Southampton  EFL Cup final   live  Read more  Kane completed his hat trick five minutes later  this time with Lady Luck joining Eriksen on assist duty  The Dane rolled a free kick to the striker  whose strike from nearly 30 yards seemed unlikely to worry Lee Grant until it deflected off Crouch and carried on past the nonplussed goalkeeper and into the net   Kane may have had a hat trick under his belt but he continued to contribute to Stoke s debagging  He embarrassed Bruno Martins Indi with a cheeky piece of skill before racing towards the box in time added on at the end of the first half  Instead of shooting from a difficult angle he presented Alli with the easy task of stroking the ball into the empty net   Stoke  seemingly dazed by Spurs  speed and movement  looked like they could do with a break  and perhaps a lie down  They attempted to restore a measure of dignity in the second half  or at least preserve the ruins of it   Preservation was the name of Pochettino s game when he withdrew Vertonghen and Toby Alderweireld in the second half amid complaints of slight strains   Spurs did not over stretch themselves for the sake of a fifth goal  especially after Kane collided with a post while attempting to convert a header  Alli tried to double his own tally in the final minute but flicked a shot just wide from six yards   Alli s overall performance was bright   and unsullied by the sort of tackle that had earned him a red card against Gent on Thursday  Pochettino had words with him after that but would not disclose them here   They will remain private but you can imagine   he said before adding with a smile   I gave him more love than normal  He was very sad and disappointed  after Thursday  but he s only 20 years old  I will always protect and support him  He s one of the best young players in the world  Sometimes he can make mistakes but I want him on the pitch    The win lifted Spurs to within 10 points of league leaders Chelsea   The target is to keep winning and be there if anything wrong happens to Chelsea   Pochettino said  If only they could play Stoke every week ",

title to do so in his career   But in a weekend of awesome mainstream holdovers  coupled with Get Out s surprise  and the Oscar nom staying power of Hidden Figures  La La Land and Lion  there was little room for the new guys  Lionsgate Premiere s Rock Dog and IM Global Open Road s Collide to squeeze in  Rock Dog ultimately fell outside the top 10 with an estimated  3 7M  With this type of low budget animation  Lionsgate has zero production costs  and receives a distribution fee  In addition  it s a film like this typically has a P A in the teens  and LG will be on the hook for half of that number  There s usually not an upside at the box office  but if the title over indexes on home entertainment  then there s a few bucks to be made  Collide at  1 54M is lucky to see the light of day after a two year delay since the title was buried in Relativity s bankruptcy  In our previous post we dive into how IM financially covered this Joel Silver production and got it off the ground  IM s exposure is lower on Collide because they brought equity  however  rivals tell me no one is bound to walk away with any cash in the end after this cinematic car crash   Oscar nominated titles were buoyed by moviegoers getting their last look at them before tonight s ceremony  Lionsgate Summit s La La Land stayed even with last weekend s take of  4 6M and a running cume of  140 86M  which is where we predicted it would be by this time  At  152 8M  Hidden Figures slightly beat our forecast by Oscar night  with Lion being 22  higher than what we saw with  42 8M  And it was a no brainer that Arrival with its eight Oscar nominations including best picture would beam past  100M Out of all the best pic nominees  ComScore reports that those earning the most of their gross post noms are as

Per screen average   12 2K   3 day   24K   Wk 1  Writethru Saturday AM on 3rd Update  Friday PM  Universal Blumhouse s weekend box office hit Get Out  which is looking at a three day of anywhere between  28M and  29M right now  is the fourth No  1 opener for the studios  partnership together after The Purge  Ouija and last month s Split   In addition  box office analysts currently believe that Jordan Peele s feature directorial debut isn t going to only be a front loaded like other horror pics  but could see a 5  gain on Saturday over Friday s  10 8M   Also  get this   Get Out gets an A  CinemaScore which is largely unheard of for a horror title  Typically these movies are lucky to earn a B or B   and that s considered awesome  but Get Out is in rare air alongside The Conjuring 1 and 2 which both received A  grades  The 18 24 bunch who repped close to a third of all moviegoers gave Get Out an A   Older females  53   over 25  61   were the main crowd last night according to CinemaScore   Seriously  consider for a minute how much of an anomaly Get Out is  It s a horror film from a first time filmmaker who is known for his Emmy winning comedy work on Comedy Central s Key   Peele  The movie doesn t star any marquee draws  in fact  it s the first major studio film for Girls  Allison Williams  The director himself  Jordan Peele  given his TV work  is arguably the biggest draw on the one sheet and he doesn t even appear in the movie  Even more amazing  Get Out is going to make more in its opening weekend than Peele s Keanu   20 6M   which was his first on screen appearance following the mammoth success of Key   Peele  Seventeen percent came out because it was Peele s directorial debut according to CinemaScore  while 50  were horror film fans  Blumhouse  once again following Split  demonstrates that when it comes to great horror films  it s best handled by auteurs on a shoe string budget    Horror and comedy are very linked to me   said Peele at the Sundance secret screening for Get Out   They re about getting a physical reaction and pinpointing when that physical reaction happens  You need to know where your audience is  One is a laugh  and one is a scare  In truly scary scenes  you can get someone to laugh    Critics have warmed to Get Out given the real horror it exhibits  That racism unfortunately continues to exude strongly in our society   During his Sundance post screening Q A  Peele added that Get Out  was a missing piece in the genre  One of my favorite movies is the Stepford Wives and the way it dealt with social issues in regards to gender  I just thought  that s proof that you can pull off a movie about race  that s a thriller and entertaining and fun    Peele hatched the story idea eight years ago  when Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton were up against each other for the Democratic  presidential  nomination  All of a sudden  the country was focused for a second on Black civil rights and the women s civil rights movement and where they intersect and who deserves to be president more  and who has waited long enough  It s an absurd thing that civil rights were divided  That was when the germ of the idea hit me  It marinated for a long time and I wrote the script three years ago    He pitched the idea to QC Entertainment s Sean McKittrick who said  I ve definitely never seen this movie before    Added Peele   Here s a movie that s never gonna get made  and by the end  of our coffee   Sean was like   Let s make it '   The duo eventually made there way to Jason Blum who was quick to embrace   I like a movie that uses horror to smuggle a social issue to a ton of people  That s what I responded to in this script  That s what resonated with me in The Purge  It s really a movie about gun control gone crazy  the other way  It s a cautionary tale  There s a similar thing about a different issue in this movie   said the Blumhouse chief at Sundance   Further expounding on his inspirations for Get Out  Peele also said at the fest   We had this Black president and we re living in this post racial lie  This whole idea that we ve passed it all  For me  and many Black people out there  there s racism  I experience it on an everyday basis  This movie was meant to reveal that there s the monster of racism lurking underneath these seemingly innocent conversations and situations  It s been fascinating watching the last few years develop  because now the movie is coming out in a very different America from where it began  I think it s more important now  and far more interesting now  I respect Universal for having the F   king balls leaning into this kind of shit     It was very important for me for this movie not to be about the Black guy going to the South and going to a red state where the presumption for a lot of people is that everyone is a racist there   added Peele   This was really meant to take a stab at the liberal elite that tends to believe that we re above these things    Following the Sundance secret screening  some of the promo stunts that moved the needle for Get Out included Uni hosting a social influencer screening  Q A with Chance the Rapper followed by a high profile Grammy spot that was supported by promoted tweets and ads through Snapchat s Grammy Awards Live Story  The Brooklyn Academy of Music in New York curated a series of movies that influenced Peele while making Get Out  In addition  there were numerous TV spots that aired on ESPN  Comedy Central  BET  Fox and CBS as well as during NBA Basketball games   Russell Simmons  All Def Digital was also involved with a Get Out marketing integration similar to their involvement with Screen Gems  Don t Breathe  Emerging artist Rome Fortune composed an original song with metaphors inspired by the movie further propped by the visual designs by All Def Digital s creative director  Scott Weintrob  In less than one week  the music video has clocked 1 2M plus views across Facebook and YouTube   Open Road  With Get Out riding atop the chart as well as three weekend old holdovers  one of this weekend s casualties is Open Road IM Global s Euro auto action film Collide starring a bulk of talent from across the pond including Felicity Jones  Nicholas Hoult  Anthony Hopkins and Ben Kingsley  In combing through the ashes of this movie which cost an estimated net of  21 5M and is looking at a weekend opening outside the top 10 of  1 5M  we hear that IM Global chief Stuart Ford is the unsung hero when it came to rescuing this movie  Collide was in the clutches of Relativity and its bankruptcy crisis and if it wasn t for Ford  Collide wouldn t see the light of projection on stateside screens   Collide was largely built for an overseas crowd  and as we saw last weekend with The Great Wall  10 day B O  by Sunday is an estimated  33 7M   their tastes differ greatly from U S  audiences in terms of spectacle  Tonight  those U S  crowds who sat in the passenger seat for Collide  wanted to get out of the car  giving it a C  CinemaScore  Open Road took a distribution fee and implemented a digital P A in the spirit of such movies as Don t Breathe and Sausage Party in an effort to draw a young crowd  That plan didn t yield much  especially in the wake of Get Out  P A was not funded by IM Global or Open Road  but by a consortium of institutional P A investors from the U S  and China  In financing Collide  we understand that IM Global bankrolled the movie with DMG Entertainment from China and Sycamore Pictures  The original production cost was in the high  20M range and after soft money from Germany  that fell to a net of  21 5M  Seventy five percent of the total budget  we hear  was covered via IM output deals and foreign sales  IM Global has very little exposure in the U S  market despite Collide s crash  and that s because they brought equity to the movie in their output deals  The movie currently counts  3 2M from seven territories according to ComScore with more European and Latin American openings to follow  Of that  3 2M   2 2M was generated in China   A near split last night among men and women at Collide with females having the edge at 51   Over 25 bought most of the tickets at 68  giving it a C  however  the under 25 bunch were more tolerant giving it a B  They were in the minority though repping 32  of the crowd   Lionsgate  Lionsgate Premiere s Rock Dog lands in ninth with an estimated  3 5M and a B  from the families who dared watched this animated feature with the voices of Luke Wilson  Lewis Black  J K  Simmons and Eddie Izzard  That said  those kids who showed up loved it with the under 18 at 47  giving Rock Dog a solid A  The opening is lower than last year s Norm of the North   6 8M  and slightly higher than last September s The Wild Life   3 3M   The company argues that they re in this flea market feature toon business because these movies are service deals with minimized risks with further upside in the home entertainment market  RelishMix reports that the social conversation for Rock Dog  was skeptical  buoyed off a light social media universe that s just under 17M across Instagram  Twitter  Facebook and YouTube  notoriously low for a family film    La La Land Lionsgate  However  Rock Dog s performance is an afterthought in Lionsgate s weekend  Better days in the sun lie ahead for the distributor  even if it rains on Sunday  as La La Land hopes to take home its 14 Oscar nominations  Should the Damien Chazelle original musical win best picture  industry analysts believe the film s domestic B O  will jump another 11  from  140M on Sunday to  155M   Below are the top 10 films for the weekend of Feb  24 26  2017  Oscar weekend  per Friday night industry estimates   1   Get Out  UNI   2 781

Jordan Peele directed movie will deliver both studios  its second back to back hit after M  Night Shyamalan s Split last month  which just cracked past  200M   Get Out will easily slot the top spot giving Uni Blumhouse their fourth No  1 opening together after Split   40M   The Purge   34M   and Ouija   19 8M   Also  in one weekend  Peele s Get Out  which he does not appear in  will have

to make between  10M  10 5M  including last night s  1 8M   Holdovers will rule the rest of the top of the chart with Warner Bros  The Lego Batman Movie flying down to second with an estimated third

movie which cost under  5M before P A  The movie is currently No  1 on Fandango  repping 32  of all tickets sold this morning  QC Entertainment is also a producer on Get Out   Last night s cash is just  200K shy of Universal Blumhouse s previous collaboration together last month  M  Night Shyamalan s Split  which went on to a jawdropping opening weekend of  40M and crossed  200M yesterday  In addition  Get Out beats the  1M Thursday night made by Shyamalan s The Visit  and the  722K made by Ouija  Origin Of Evil  Get Out s Thursday is also  100K shy of Screen Gems  Don t Breathe which went on to open to  26 4M   In addition   and the irony is that the comedic Peele doesn t even appear in Get Out   the horror title beats the  560K Thursday night gross of Keanu  his R rated combo with his Comedy Central series partner Keegan Michael Key   Shutterstock  Ever since Get Out screened secretly at the Sundance Film Festival  critics  drums grew increasingly louder for the film to the point where it now owns a 100  certified fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes off 99 reviews  It used to be that horror titles ducked film reviewers since mainstream critics took delight in murdering them  essentially  genre press would be the only outlets granted access  With the renaissance in auteur horror cinema  there s been a positive response from major metropolitan film critics  and thus their blessings spell victorious for a genre film s outcome at the B O  Wall Street Journal s Joe Morgenstern expounds on how this film about an African American young man who visits his Caucasian girlfriend s family  strikes a nerve   Get Out starts with a great title and a promising idea   a black man s fear as he walks at night down a street in an affluent white suburb  Then it delivers on that promise with explosive brilliance   Meanwhile  The New Yorker says that Peele with his combination of humor and political fury is  An American Bunuel    Fandango reports that 94  of the audience was inspired to buy a ticket based on the film s trailer  That makes sense considering that when Uni launched the first trailer in October  it clocked more than 30M views and was fueled by an enormous volume of organic sharing  with more than a half a million shares on Facebook alone in under 24 hours   Let s not forget the Oscars are on Sunday night  and moviegoers will head out to get their last fix of nominees before the ceremony  AMC is bringing back all nine of the best picture nominees with its 11th annual Best Picture Showcase  Tomorrow the exhibitor will play all best pic nominees with some locations projecting all nine in a row  Best picture nominees La La Land from Lionsgate Summit and Hidden Figures from 20th Century Fox remain in wide release in 1 733 and 2 022 theaters  respectively   Collide IM Global  Also opening wide this weekend is Lionsgate s animated title Rock Dog in 2 077 theaters and IM Global Open Road s Collide in 2 045  Neither is expected to shake up the chart  with industry projections of  6M  7M and  3M  4M  respectively  Collide  a Euro auto action crime movie that stars Felicity Jones  Nicholas Hoult  Anthony Hopkins and Ben Kingsley  has already banked  3 2M per ComScore from seven territories including China and Germany  Bigger European markets and Latin America are to come following its U S  bow  Open Road has a distribution fee on this title following IM Global rescuing their movie from Relativity s bankruptcy close to two years ago   Warner Bros  The Lego Batman Movie is the biggest potential threat to Get Out should it slip from No  1  Industry projections see a third weekend for the animated title between  16M  18M  but if it overperforms due to matinees  it could invade Get Out s turf  Last night  Lego Batman drew  1 8M    really  it did   Its two week cume stands at  114M   Universal will also have a great weekend with Fifty Shades Darker  which will cross the  100M mark with an estimated  10M  The E L  James

behind  Key   Peele   He has created a horror satire that  in telling the story of a young black man  British actor Daniel Kaluuya  meeting the family of his white girlfriend  Allison Williams   becomes a potent look at some of the core issues of the moment  It manages to be smart  aware  funny and scary  often all in the same scene   In his review for The Times  Justin Chang said that the film  feels like a long overdue response to Hollywood s collective failure  This is surely the nerviest  most confrontational treatment of race in America to emerge from a major studio in years  and it brilliantly fulfills the duty of both its chosen genres   the horror thriller and the social satire   to meaningfully reflect a culture s latent fears and anxieties    Allison Williams is Rose and

Manohla Dargis called the film  an exhilaratingly smart and scary freakout  while adding that Peele s  greatest stroke in  Get Out   though  is to have hitched these genre elements to an evil that isn

claim    It wasn't much of a vacation   said the freshman at Queen's University of Charlotte in North Carolina   What Lia didn't know was that her clubs had already been posted for sale on Kijiji  Police then got involved and ended up charging a 38 year old man with theft   It all started when Lia  who is attending the school on a golf scholarship  was taking an Air Canada flight to her parents' home on Dec  15   Before her connecting flight from Toronto  the airline told her the clubs couldn't go on the plane because the flight was overweight  and assured her they would be on the next one  then the next one    After hearing that excuse a couple times  we started to think something was a little fishy   Lia said   Angelo and Shelly Lia contacted Peel Police when they spotted their daughter's  5 000 custom golf clubs for sale on Kijiji   Shelly Lia    Her concerned parents called Air Canada's baggage services hotline and sat through endless loops of automated voices to no avail   On Jan  2  Lia's 20th birthday  the young golfer was surprised when her father spotted the missing clubs for sale in a Kijiji ad based out of London  Ont  The ad was dated Dec  16  the day after Lia travelled home    We were getting ready to head out to dinner and my husband says  'I found the clubs '  recalled Lia's mother  Shelly Lia  who said Air Canada's response to the case has been  below par    The seller was asking  1 000 for the customized clubs  The posting boasted they would make a  great Christmas gift    Angelo Lia came across this Kijiji ad selling his daughter's  5 000 customized clubs for  1 000 online  and then alerted police   Angelo Lia    Honestly  I felt a little sick to my stomach   said Shelly Lia   I was in shock  How did these clubs get there    The Lias reported the theft to Peel Regional Police  since Pearson International Airport falls under the force's jurisdiction   Police called the phone number on the posting and set up a meeting with the seller on Jan  10   'Honestly  I felt a little sick to my stomach '   Shelly Lia   The seller produced the golf clubs and they're easily identifiable because the victim did provide us with serial numbers   Const  Harbinder Sohi told CBC Toronto   Police arrested the seller during the meeting just outside the Greater Toronto Area   The seller is from London  Ont   and has been charged with theft over  5 000 and possession of property obtained by crime   Sohi confirmed the would be seller does not work for any airline or at Pearson Airport  and was a passenger travelling through the airport at the time the golf clubs were there    As far as our investigation is concerned  it does not appear to be a large scale theft ring that's involved here  It's an isolated incident   he said   Peel Regional Police Const  Harbinder Sohi told CBC News a 38 year old man from London  Ont  has been arrested in connection with the missing golf clubs   Paul Smith CBC    Lia's clubs are being held as evidence  Sohi said they will likely be returned next week   In the meantime  Lia has been using an old set for her golf competitions    Golf is a very mental game   Lia said   Not having my clubs made me lose a lot of confidence in what I was trying to do and what I was trying to fix    The Lias recently forked out thousands to buy new customized clubs   CBC Toronto received the following statement from Air Canada via email on Wednesday   We are sorry for the inconvenience this has caused and we have offered the customer  2 030 as a goodwill gesture  which they will be able to keep even once the clubs are returned    Airline passenger rights advocate Gabor Lukacs  founder of Facebook Group AirPassengerRights  Canada   says Air Canada should compensate the Lia's for  5 000 worth of lost baggage  not  2 000   AirPassengersRights  Canada    But on the back of the cheque the Lias received from the airline is this statement   In consideration of my claim filed against Air Canada  by cashing or endorsing this cheque I hereby give full and final release and discharge of this claim to Air Canada    Air passenger rights activist Gabor Lukacs isn't impressed    They basically wanted to trick the passengers into depositing a cheque for  2 000  therefore giving up their claims   he told CBC Toronto   He said the airline's  act of goodwill  is required by law once items are lost for more than 21 days  and Lukacs  founder of Facebook Group AirPassengerRights  Canada   is pushing Air Canada to compensate the Lias for the full  5 000   He explained the standard liability amount for a lost bag is around  2 000  but under the Montreal Convention  which governs the liability of airlines for damage  delay  and loss of baggage on international itineraries  there is an exception if crime is involved    Stealing a passenger's belongings  or allowing the theft to happen in an area that is not exposed to the public  surely falls under willful misconduct   he said   It is not clear exactly from where the clubs were stolen   Air Canada said it cannot comment on this specific case  as it's before the courts  But when CBC Toronto asked general questions about its storage and security protocols and how the public could get access to checked baggage  the airline did not respond    Canada is the land of no consequences for the airlines and this must change   Lukacs said ",

deployed Saturday morning to gather information about the incident  which took place shortly after midnight in heavy fog and rain   Initial findings show that during its landing sequence  Flight 623 travelled through the grass on the western side of the runway  eventually coming to a stop on the centre line  said Tasker  The flight carried 118 people  though it's unknown if that number includes crew members  No injuries were reported    The runway at the time was reported to be damp or wet  there was thundershowers in the area and rain   Tasker said  Whether the wetness was a factor  he said  it's too early to tell   Early information shows five lights on the western side of the runway were damaged  along with one of the plane's tires  Tasker said  There was minor damage to the aircraft  which will be fully examined  Witnesses reported that the plane's side was covered in mud   As part of the investigation  the plane's cockpit data recorder and flight data recorder will be sent to a TSB lab in Ottawa for examination  The TSB will also be working to collect thorough weather information with the help of Environment Canada   Tire 'completely gone ' passenger says  The next steps

Canadian air force for over 30 years and was once an instructor for Transport Canada   CBC   He's not an investigator but says he has seen wet runways cause planes to go off the runway before due to a phenomenon called hydroplaning   when a layer of wetness prevents tires from making direct contact with the ground's surface  causing them instead to skim the surface    They're at the mercy of the laws of physics and the runway and mother nature with the wind  And if all those combine in their favour   they go in a straight line  come to a stop  taxi back in and nobody knows   Williams said

        "body0": "Pierre LeBrun TSN Hockey Insider Follow Archive  TORONTO    Frederik Andersen is just four starts away from equaling his career high for a season set in Anaheim two years ago    and there's still a quarter of the season to go   That's life as an uncontested No  1 after his trade from the Anaheim Ducks to the Toronto Maple Leafs last summer  subsequently signing a five year deal worth  25 million    and trying to prove that GM Lou Lamoriello wasn't out of his mind for putting his faith in the 27 year old Denmark native who had been sharing the net with John Gibson last season   Andersen's 24 wins are tied for 10th in the NHL  and although there have been ups and downs in his play  he has been the workhorse the Leafs had hoped for  And let's face it  Toronto's mediocre at times defensive coverage hasn't actually helped him  either   If the move to hockey crazy Toronto can be overwhelming to some  it hasn't been for Andersen  always gracious with his time for the media  even after a morning skate on game days  by the way  when some goalies around the league don't talk  and his warm smile most often greets those entering the dressing room on a daily basis   Andersen sat down Wednesday with ESPN com to talk Toronto  workload and coaches   ESPN com  My first question is a basic one and yet quite prevalent  given the workload you're taking on this season  for the first time as an uncontested No  1  How does your mind and body feel right now   Andersen  My body feels great  I haven't had too many issues throughout the year  And those that have come along  we've been taking care of them really well  The trainers here have been great  They do a good job of helping me maintain good health  knock on wood  And  mentally  I've been good  Lately I've been feeling good  it hasn't gone my way  in terms of wins  I guess  but it's one of those things if you keep doing the right things  it'll turn around eventually   ESPN com  Did you seek out any advice from other goalies about what it's like to take on a bigger workload for the first time in your career   Andersen  Not so much  I talked to people I trust  like my agent and trainers  The coaching staff here and management have all been very helpful  too  They try to guide you and help you along   ESPN com  What's your communication like with head coach Mike Babcock in terms of mapping out when you're starting  and how far ahead do you look at that together   Andersen  He doesn't really tell me too much  Andersen smiles   he just tells me when I'm not playing  I guess  Yeah  my communication is far more with  Leafs goalie coach  Stevie Briere  We talk a lot  We talk every day  about everything   ESPN com  What has been the bigger adjustment for you this year  becoming an unchallenged No  1 for the first time in your career or arriving to this hockey crazed market  where the spotlight shines brighter on you compared to where you started your career   Andersen  The market has been good  Obviously  it's been different  but I haven't really felt the difference too much  I haven't let it get to me too much  It's been mostly a good thing  I've enjoyed the focus on hockey here  It's been fun so far  You can feel the excitement around the city and in the room too  we know we have a good group and we're building something very special  We've still got a ways to go  but we're going towards something really good   ESPN com  What's it been like walking around town  being in restaurants or the grocery store  what's the interaction with fans like   Andersen  Yeah  it's pretty similar as it was in Anaheim    when you've played there long enough  people who watch hockey know it's you  But you can also go a little bit unnoticed  It's been fun here  People have been respectful  I've always felt this way but if people ask for a picture  and it makes their day  I'm happy to do it   ESPN com  Have you grasped the history of this team  the fact they haven't won a Cup since 1967  I know so much of that has nothing to do with you current players  but just the historical aspect of being part of this team  You saw what it meant in Chicago in baseball for the Cubs to finally win   Andersen  Yeah  we have a chance here in the future to change that  we want to be the group that brings it home to Toronto  Everyone wants to win the Cup  that's the bottom line for every player  but we'd love to bring it here  Given the history  it would make it even more special  Because one thing that's stood out a lot to me is how the alumni sticks around here  and you get to meet them and they tell stories  Every time you do something with them or you see them around  it's a good reminder of the history of this team and the franchise   ESPN com  Do you keep in touch with any of the Ducks  people back in Anaheim  They still have a very good team   Andersen  Yeah  they've been doing well and playing solid  I've noticed their play the last little while  The guy I talk to the most is  Andrew  Cogliano  he was a great friend on the team  He's a really good friend of mine  We talk pretty regularly   ESPN com  Cogliano is from around these parts  Did he help you in terms of knowing what to expect in this city   Andersen  Oh  yeah  for sure  He definitely helped me  He was here last summer when I came for the first time  He took me around a little bit and showed me around  He helped me a bit getting to know the city  Yeah  he's been an awesome friend to have   ESPN com  Last question  what's it like in this room when there's no one else around except the players  who is the loudest or funniest guy   Andersen  laughing  pointing across the room   A lot of stuff points over there to Leo  Komarov   He's definitely a loud guy  outspoken and not afraid to say something funny  He's got some good stuff sometimes  But it's very loose in here  a fun group to be in ", 
        "body2": "Kristen Shilton TSN Toronto Maple Leafs Reporter Follow Archive  The Maple Leafs dressing room was packed to the hilt Tuesday morning  with a crush of Canadian media eager to talk to Auston Matthews about the evening s matchup against Patrik Laine and the Winnipeg Jets   Seated at the opposite end of the room from the Matthews  scrum  goaltender Frederik Andersen took in the chaos that has become a regular occurrence during his first season in Toronto    If I had walked into a room with this many people before coming here  I would have been like   What is going on   I look around now  and this is normal   said Andersen   I ve been growing into it  embracing it and not trying to hide from it  I know the media isn t really against us    While admitting Matthews  gets the worst of  the media attention  Andersen has also been under the microscope all season  and even more so recently  Toronto s starter has only two wins over his last eight games  with a  857 save percentage  Many of the issues that plagued him early in the year   poor positioning  inefficiency in his movements   have been cropping up again  and Toronto s inconsistent defence hasn t afforded him much help   Meanwhile  backup goalie Curtis McElhinney has been fantastic since his arrival from Columbus in mid January  going 3 3 0 with 2 08 goals against average and a  938 save percentage  Andersen s playing time doesn t appear to be in jeopardy  but having the veteran in the fold and performing like he is provides Andersen with a motivational push    It s great to have good competitiveness within your team  Every time Mac plays well it pushes me to play well   Andersen said   Even with the shooters in practice  I m trying to dial it up where I m not letting them beat me so they ll be better in games  We ve all been really pushing each other    Andersen last faced the Jets in Toronto s third game of the season  a 5 4 overtime loss despite the Maple Leafs holding a 4 0 lead in the second period  Laine completed his first career hat trick when he fired home the game winner    You guys like to look back at that   Andersen joked about the first game   We ve built a lot in this group  since   People talk about how young we are  but we ve been adding a lot of experience throughout the year and I think it s been showing lately  We re excited to play against these guys again  not just to get revenge  but to keep up with this race in our division    Toronto s current stretch of four wins over their last 12 games has made taking a firm hold on a playoff spot impossible  Heading into Tuesday night  they re sitting in ninth place in the Eastern Conference  one point back of Boston and Florida   While Andersen does keep an eye on the standings  he notes how futile it is to be caught up in positioning when the margins between teams are so miniscule  Instead  Andersen sees the team s 4 0 win over Carolina on Sunday as a bigger indicator of where they can go from here    It s one of those where you feel like you ve been on the wrong side of some breaks and things haven t been going the way you wanted  and then you play a great game and you start fighting your way out of it   he said   You can feel things starting to go your way    Morning skate notes    Mitch Marner will miss his third straight game on Tuesday  and was placed on IR retroactive to Feb  15  He could be back as soon as Thursday  but Babcock listed him as  day to day  and said that usually means about 10 days  Having him out of the lineup is a break for the Jets  who are dealing with the loss of defenceman Jacob Trouba  suspension  on their blueline     After being a healthy scratch in Monday s Toronto Marlies  game  Frederik Gauthier was recalled by the Maple Leafs and will slot in Tuesday night for fourth line centre Ben Smith  Smith has been struggling of late  particularly in the faceoff dot where he s consistently lauded for his skills  He s averaged a 32 6 per cent success rate on draws over his last three games  and only 48 8 per cent in the 10 games since he returned from a broken hand  Babcock ultimately decided it was time for a change  saying he s giving Smith  a reset  before getting him back in the lineup  Meanwhile  Gauthier didn t even get confirmation of his recall until this morning  but with the Marlies playing a nearly identical system to the Maple Leafs  the transition is easier   There are a few adjustments  but I just have to be more mean  be heavy down low   Gauthier said   That s something I previously worked on and I want to bring that back and get better and better every game      Laine got most of the attention in the Jets room ahead of Tuesday s game  commanding a scrum of reporters for more than 20 minutes  but it s the man centering his line that Babcock had the highest praise for   Mark Scheifele  in my opinion  is one of the best centers in the league  I think he s a real hockey player   Babcock said   In fairness to Auston  we play him with two kids  Connor Brown and Zach Hyman  all the time  Obviously  the Jets  have to worry about Matthews  but we have to worry about Laine  and because of the package they have  with  Blake  Wheeler and  Bryan  Little on the other line  They ve got good forwards here      For the second time this season  forward Brooks Laich has been placed on waivers by the Maple Leafs  After clearing waivers the first time on Oct  10  Laich was assigned to the Toronto Marlies the next day and has spent the entirety of his season there  It hasn t been a very productive one   In 22 AHL games  Laich has amassed just six points  one goal  five assists  and is without a point his last eight games  Laich also missed 20 games from Dec  18 to Feb  7 with an undisclosed injury  Following Monday s 4 2 win over the Binghamton Senators  Laich expressed in the media that if he s not going to be part of the Maple Leafs  plans  he wants to go elsewhere  His six year   27  million contract expires at the end of this season ",
