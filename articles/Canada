In 1997, the late Dr. Billy Taylor (Kennedy Center Artistic Director for Jazz, 1994-2010) invited Carter to bring Jazz Ahead to Washington, D.C. In April 1998, the inaugural class of Kennedy Center Jazz Ahead students presented an unforgettable concert with Carter herself joining them on the Kennedy Center Concert Hall stage. Jason Moran, then a young pianist from Houston, was selected by Carter to be a student in this first year at Kennedy Center. BetTy Carter's Jazz Ahead had a new home and Carter was filled with hope for the future of the program. After Carter's untimely death in September 1998, the Carter family graciously granted the Kennedy Center the opportunity to continue her legacy by making the program an annual Kennedy Center event. Distinguished alumni from BetTy Carter's Jazz Ahead include pianists Jason Moran and Aaron Parks; guitarist Lage Lund; trombonist Andre Hayward; bassist Ameen Saleem; violinist Miri Ben-Ari; vocalists Daniela Schaechter, Grace Kelly, and Jazzmeia Horn; saxophonists Marcus Strickland and Jon Irabagon; and drummer Jamison Ross, among others.\n\nBetTy Carter's Jazz Ahead 2017 Participants\n\nNAME INSTRUMENT HOMETOWN Noel Mason Bass Australia Kenneth Jimenez Bass Costa Rica Emiliano Lasansky Upright Bass Iowa City, IA Daniel Giannone Drums Wayne, NJ Carlos Moreno Druma Portland, OR Misaki Nakamichi Drums Japan Will Rachofsky Guitar New York, NY Django Martin-Rowe Guitar Australia William Kjeer Piano Saint Paul, MN Bijan Taghavi Piano New York, NY Matthew Whitaker Piano Hackensack, NJ Nathan Hook Saxophone Philadelphia, PA Markus Howell Saxophone Deerfield Beach, FL DeAndre Lettsome Saxophone Jacksonville, FL Daniel Dickinson Saxophone New York, NY CaleB Smith Trombone Shaker Heights, OH Abdulrahman Amer Trombone New York, NY Yakiv Tsvietinskyi Trumpet Ukraine Giveton Gelin Trumpet Bahamas Florian Klinger Vibraphone Austria Mia Knop Jacobsen Voice Germany Chloe Brisson Voice Hanover, NH Ayodele Owolabi Voice Buford, GA\n\nABOUT KENNEDY CENTER JAZZ\n\nKennedy Center Jazz, under the leadership of Artistic Director Jason Moran, presents legendary artists who have helped shape the art form, artists who are emerging on the jazz scene, and innovative multidisciplinary projects in hundreds of performances a year.

        "body0": "Related\n\nQUEBEC \u2014 Public Security Minister Martin Coiteux says he was kept in the dark about the calamity happening in the snowstorm on Hwy. 13 last week where 300 vehicles were trapped for hours and hours.\n\nCoiteux\u2019s press aide, Marie-\u00c8ve Pelletier, confirmed Tuesday there was a breakdown in communication and that Coiteux never really was informed of how bad things were.\n\nShe released two documents \u2014 government status reports \u2014 showing neither the Ministry of Transport nor the Public Security Ministry had a handle on the situation unfolding on the highway.\n\nOne document shows the ministry\u2019 information hub, the Centre des op\u00e9rations gouvernmentales, set up in 2006 after the Saguenay flooding disaster, informed the minister at 6 p.m. Tuesday evening that there had been an accident in Saint-Zotique, near the Ontario border.\n\nIt mentions no other particular incidents.\n\nIn a second update, Wednesday at 7:15 a.m., the centre refers to a jam on Hwy. 13 but says there were 30, not 300 cars stuck on the road and it never called for reinforcements when the situation eroded.\n\nThe documents were released as the government continues a damage control operation sparked by the storm. The opposition parties have been calling for Coiteux\u2019s head as well as that of Transport Minister Laurent Lessard.\n\nIn one heated moment, the opposition reported Coiteux was seen dining at the Concorde restaurant on the Grand All\u00e9e as the blizzard roared.\n\nHis staff noted later Coiteux was not in the posh upper level rotating restaurant but in fact in the more modest pizza restaurant on the ground floor. He was there a total of 30 minutes despite the opposition\u2019s attacks.\n\nScrambling to repair storm damage\n\nMinisters \u2014 including Premier Philippe Couillard himself \u2014 have been scrambling to repair the storm damage to the Liberal brand ever since. After Couillard\u2019s apology last week, the transport ministry also apologized.\n\nThe opposition is nevertheless expected to resume its attacks Tuesday when the legislature reconvenes.\n\nAt a news conference earlier, Coalition Avenir Qu\u00e9bec leader Fran\u00e7ois Legault gave a hint of what he would focus on, saying it\u2019s impossible for Coiteux to know nothing because all the radio and television broadcasts Tuesday night talked about the highway.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s as if they want to wash their hands of the problem, and put the blame on the bureaucrats,\u201d Legault said. \u201cThey (ministers) have to be held accountable. They should have been in control of the situation.\u201d\n\nOn Monday, the S\u00fbret\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec\u2019s internal investigation also revealed a breakdown in the chain of command, with senior officers not informed of what was happening by junior ones, S\u00fbret\u00e9 spokesperson Guy Lapointe said.\n\nThat in turn left senior ministers like Coiteux in the dark.\n\nTwo SQ officers have since been relieved of duties as a result of the bungle on the highway. The SQ has also named a new director of emergency measures, Jimmy Potvin.\n\npauthier@postmedia.com\n\nhttps://twitter.com/PhilipAuthier",

        "body2": "Mar 14, 2017; Fort Myers, FL, USA; Toronto Blue Jays manager John Gibbons (5) looks on during the first inning against the Boston Red Sox at JetBlue Park. Mandatory Credit: Kim Klement-USA TODAY Sports\n\nAccording to a report from the Toronto Sun, John Gibbons is expected to sign a contract extension with the Toronto Blue Jays before opening day.\n\nOne of John Gibbons\u2018 most valuable assets, is his (most of the time) laid-back, easy-going personality. It is this demeanor, which allows him to deal with all the egos that populate the Toronto Blue Jays roster.\n\nAs such, it comes as no surprise Gibbons told the front office to put his contract situation to the back of the line, after the conclusion of last season. He was well aware general manager Ross Atkins and company had extensive work to do, in respect of putting together a team for 2017.\n\nHowever, good things come to those who wait, and the Great Falls, Montana native should have a new deal in place soon enough. In fact, as per the Toronto Sun\u2018s Rob Longley, a contract extension will more than likely be agreed prior to opening day.\n\nThe main question relates to how long the new deal will be for? Gibbons\u2019 current contract is due to expire at the end of the upcoming season.\n\nYou imagine the 54-year old would like any new contract to be for more than just one additional year. Fortunately for him, it sounds like Atkins has a similar mindset, as he told Longley and other members of the media:\n\n\u201cJohn and I have worked well together over the (last) year and we both feel very fortunate to have established trust and respect. When you come into a new situation not having those established lines of communication, then going through a year we feel that not only was a successful one but a very productive one for the two of us (is a positive). So looking forward, we\u2019re talking about the Blue Jays organization and not just the two of us leading it, but the two of us being a part of leading it together.\u201d\n\nThat we are now in this situation tells you how well Gibbons has done since returning for his second tenure as Blue Jays\u2019 manager in 2013. At the time of his re-hiring, it was met with a certain degree of apathy.\n\nWhen the former catcher went on to produce a 74-88 record during his first season back in charge, there were calls for him to be replaced. Fortunately for everyone concerned, this didn\u2019t happen and the organization has benefited immensely.\n\nGibbons has gone on to record a winning record in each of his three seasons since, while also ending the Blue Jays\u2019 21-year postseason drought. Further, he has taken the team to within striking distance of the World Series, with two consecutive ALCS appearances.\n\nFor another indication of how successful the 1980 first round draft pick has been in Toronto, consider his overall wins total. Entering the 2017 season, his mark of 644 wins is only topped by a certain Cito Gaston, who recorded 894 regular season victories.\n\nWhether Gibbons eventually surpasses this total is open to debate. However, this is little denying he deserves his contract extension, as he attempts to join Gaston as a World Series-winning manager with the Blue Jays.\n\nWhat\u2019s your overall take on the job Gibbons has done, since returning as Blue Jays manager? Are you happy he is set to sign a contract extension, or would you prefer the team go in a different direction? Share your thoughts in the comments section below.",

And in Android O, Google is making that even more powerful by allowing apps to group alerts in \u201cnotification channels,\u201d giving users more precise control over what kind of notifications they get.\n\nFor example, a news app could allow users to only receive notifications from technology sites, and shut off other kinds of breaking news. It\u2019s a feature that\u2019s similar in a lot of ways to Google\u2019s Gmail sorting, which allows a fine-grained control over what kind of email users get notified for. Android O will extend that kind of filtering to any developer, which in turn should hopefully make it easier for users to only have their phones buzz when they actually want them to.\n\nYou can snooze notifications in Android O\n\nAlong with notification channels, Google is adding a system level ability to snooze notifications in Android O. Users will be able to snooze notifications and cause them to reappear at a later time, and apps will even be able to update notifications while snoozed (although that won\u2019t make them reappear). Additionally, developers will be able to cause notifications to automatically timeout after which they\u2019ll automatically dismiss themselves.\n\nLastly, Google is adding the option for developers to set background colors for notifications, which could either be really useful for distinguishing notifications at a glance or the worst thing ever depending on how developers implement the feature.",
