More like a miscue by the selection committee.\n\nMORE HOOPS NEWS\n\nThe Blue Raiders were one of the darlings of last year\u2019s wacky, chaotic first weekend, stunning a second-seeded Michigan State team that many thought could reach the Final Four. It lost to Syracuse \u2013 which did make it to the Final Four, by the way \u2013 in the round of 32, but the experience was on full display Thursday.\n\nThough Middle Tennessee lost three starters from last year\u2019s team, it returned top scorers Upshaw and Potts. With the addition of Williams, a redshirt last year, the Blue Raiders were, if possible, even more dangerous. They won a school-record 30 games and cruised to the Conference-USA regular-season and tournament titles.\n\nThe selection committee must have missed all that, because it made the Blue Raiders a 12 seed. You know, the kind of spot usually reserved for directional schools and conferences most of the country forgets about for all but one month of the year.\n\nBut it was clear throughout the game which team was better.\n\nThe Blue Raiders outrebounded the bigger Gophers 37-24 and were a blistering 7 of 13 from 3-point range.\n\nHIGHLIGHTS FROM THE NCAA TOURNAMENT'S FIRST ROUND", 
        "body2": "A year after Middle Tennessee upset Michigan State, the Blue Raiders did it again, this time winning 81-72 against No. 5 seed Minnesota, which turned out to be its own worst enemy in a hot-and-cold game.\n\nAfter starting the game unanswered, Minnesota\u2019s supremacy sank late in the first half when star Reggie Lynch began collecting fouls like a philatelist does stamps. The second half proved just as detrimental to Lynch, who committed his third of the game, this time a borderline flagrant foul, about a minute after tip off.\n\nThe fouls would continue to haunt Minnesota as the clock ticked on. Amir Coffey, one of the team\u2019s leading scorers, also ran into foul trouble and even Coach Richard Pitino was called for a technical when he argued with the referee.\n\nLynch\u2019s early fouls, however, are what really opened up the game for the Blue Raiders against the Golden Gophers, who were forced to bench their lead defender for much of the game.\n\nMeanwhile, the Blue Raiders took off, extending the six-point lead they\u2019d racked up at halftime to 17 at one point thanks to, well, pretty much everyone.\n\nCompared to Minnesota, which saw three players, Coffey, Dupree McBrayer and Jordan Murphy, score the majority of the team\u2019s points, with 17, 16 and 15, respectively, Middle Tennessee shared the wealth. Save for one bench player, everyone on the team made at least one basket, with Reggie Upshaw, Giddy Potts and JaCorey Williams making the most with 19, 15 and 13, respectively.\n\nMiddle Tennessee\u2019s double-digit lead wouldn\u2019t hold the whole half, though. Minnesota did its best to even things out once again, chopping the Blue Raiders lead to four with under seven minutes to go.\n\nWhat upset?

It's time the Senate implement new rules for the removal of senators who have violated ethical standards,\" Cullen wrote.\n\n'Bad behaviour is inherent in a place where there is no accountability.' - NDP MP Nathan Cullen\n\nThe B.C. NDP MP said nothing less than expulsion will suffice. \"If not for this, then what? Did she need to be 14 or 15?\" he said in an interview with CBC News. In any other workplace, Meredith would be fired, Cullen said, \"The Senate's solution is to send him to a women's conference.\"\n\n\"Senators sit with the firm knowledge that they are untouchable; they have taken money, they have physically assaulted people, and they have conducted themselves in unethical ways for over a century,\" Cullen said. \"It becomes slightly less awful in terms of democratic values if they're at least a little bit more accountable to themselves.\"\n\nLyse Ricard, the Senate's ethics officer, found that Meredith violated two sections of the code of ethics, namely that the Toronto-area senator and Pentecostal pastor did not uphold the highest standards of dignity inherent to his position, and that his actions reflect adversely on the institution of the Senate.\n\nMeredith denies many of the allegations levelled against him by the woman in question \u2014 who is identified as \"Ms. M\" in the report \u2014 but concedes he had sexual intercourse with her on at least one occasion. Ottawa police investigated the matter but dropped the case without pressing criminal charges.\n\nSenator Don Meredith has been referred to the ethics officer after a report of an alleged inappropriate sexual affair with a young woman, which prompted his removal from the Conservative caucus. (CBC)\n\nRicard found reason to believe Meredith and Ms. M had intercourse three times, including once when the woman was 17 years old. Meredith denies the allegation. Her report has now been sent to the Senate's ethics committee for review, leaving senators to decide on an appropriate course of action.\n\nThe Constitution Act, 1867 enumerates five areas regarding when a senator can be permanently disqualified, but the document does not specifically address a case like the one currently before the Senate, where the prospect of a criminal conviction is unlikely.\n\n\"Bad behaviour is inherent in a place where there is no accountability. You and I know both know Senator Meredith won't be the last one. They're unelected, unaccountable and often under investigation,\" Cullen said.\n\nSenate has power to expel: expert\n\nWhile Cullen is calling on Trudeau to take action, some in the Red Chamber aren't waiting for his intervention and are already mobilizing to remove Meredith. As CBC News first reported Tuesday, the chamber's law clerk has been tasked with preparing possible legal avenues for expulsion.\n\nThe clerk, and other constitutional experts, has pointed to Section 18 of the Constitution, which stipulates that Canadian parliamentarians should have the same privileges as a British MP. Members of the British House of Commons have the power to expel one of their own, and have used it sparingly to eject wayward MPs.\n\nCan the Senate expel Don Meredith?6:01\n\n\"The Senate has all the powers that are necessary to protect its integrity and to assure its proper functioning, and that includes the power to discipline senators, and it can go all the way up to expelling members,\" Marc-Andr\u00e9 Roy, a constitutional law expert who spent several years working for the Senate, said in an interview.\n\n\"The Senate is certainly free to vote on the matter. They have rules in place, they have an internal process,\" he said.\n\nTrudeau distancing himself from Senate\n\nTrudeau has sought to distance himself from the Senate, kicking Liberal senators out of the national caucus, and establishing an independent advisory board to make recommendations on senatorial appointments.\n\n\"I think this is a question for Senate leadership as they continue to move forward in demonstrating the effectiveness and value of an upper house,\" Trudeau said last week when asked about ethics report.\n\n\"It is not for me to weigh in on how the Senate should continue to conduct itself, but of course every politician in Canada, senator or MP \u2026 needs to conduct themselves in a way that is worthy of the public trust placed in them.\"\n\nCullen said this answer from Trudeau is nothing but a cop-out. \"He's still the prime minister, he's still the one who puts people into the Senate virtually for life. He can't just say, 'I'm satisfied with the way things are,' because as long as he keeps appointing people, he sees it as a legitimate place. He must lift a finger to make it more accountable and respectful.\"\n\nPeter Harder, Trudeau's representative in the Senate, is responsible for leading reform efforts and realigning the chamber along nonpartisan lines.

        "body0": "TORONTO \u2013 Embattled Sen. Don Meredith begged forgiveness for his \u201cmoral failing\u201d over his sexual relationship with a teenager but said Thursday he was not ready to resign.\n\nSpeaking out for the first time since a damning ethics report, Meredith told The Canadian Press he was taking a leave of absence from the Senate on the advice of his doctor, and would be considering his options in the coming days and weeks.\n\n\u201cThis is a moral failing on my part,\u201d a grim-faced Meredith said in a wide-ranging interview, with his wife Michelle quietly at his side. \u201cAs a human being, I made a grave error in judgment, in my interactions. For that I am deeply sorry.\u201d\n\nMeredith, 52, repeatedly apologized to his wife, children, his fellow senators and \u201call Canadians\u201d for the relationship that took place with the woman known only as Ms. M.\n\nHis wife and children have forgiven him, he said, and he asked for the same forgiveness from his Senate colleagues and Ms. M herself.\n\n\u201cI believe in the power of forgiveness and reconciliation,\u201d he said as his Toronto lawyer looked on. \u201cWe\u2019re humans, and humans make mistakes.\u201d\n\nMeredith\u2019s wife did not wish to speak publicly about the allegations and the senator refused to answer if he\u2019d had other affairs.\n\nA chorus of voices has called on Meredith to step down amid questions of whether the Senate has the power to force him to do so. Senate sources have said they believe the upper chamber does have the power to expel a senator and declare the seat vacant, and do so by a simple majority vote.\n\nThe six-year Ontario senator said he hoped his contrition should be enough to assuage those who have been calling for him to step down. At the same time, he said, he believed there were no legal grounds to fire him.\n\nMeredith\u2019s lawyer, Selwyn Pieters, said the Constitution only allows for the removal of someone convicted of a felony, too many missed sessions, bankruptcy or treason.\n\n\u201cTaken at its highest, the allegation against Sen. Meredith is a moral failing, it\u2019s not a legal failing,\u201d Pieters said.\n\nLast week, a scathing report from Senate ethics officer Lyse Ricard said Meredith failed to uphold the \u201chighest standards of dignity inherent to the position of senator,\u201d and had acted in a way that could damage the Senate itself. Ricard also ruled Meredith had used his position as senator improperly and that he violated the Red Chamber\u2019s ethics code.\n\nThe report said Meredith had sexual relations with a woman once before she turned 18, and twice after she turned 18, and also had explicit online chats with her. Meredith acknowledged the sexual relations in the report but said it only happened after she turned 18.\n\nThe senator said Wednesday he believes he has been the victim of racism since the allegations about his affair first surfaced in the summer of 2015. Where individuals of colour rise, he said, somehow they\u2019re taken down \u2014whether its \u201cself-inflicted or orchestrated.\u201d\n\n\u201cAbsolutely, racism has played a role in this,\u201d Meredith said. \u201cThis is nothing new to me. There is always a double standard that exists in this country.\u201d\n\nPieters said his client was being portrayed as a \u201csexual predator\u201d because he is an imposing black man \u2014but that clearly was not the case.\n\nMeredith, an ordained minister and father of two, was adamant there was no criminal case against him. While Ms. M has said that she declined to press charges to protect her identity, Meredith called that \u201chearsay.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve broken no laws, and I want all Canadians to understand that.\u201d\n\nSenate insiders have said they expect the ethics committee to deliver its report on March 28, the first day back from a two-week break. But both Meredith and his lawyer said they he had a right to speak to the report and defend himself as a matter of procedural fairness.\n\nHe said he would likely hold a media conference in the next several days.\n\n\u201cI believe that it is my right to consider all options that are available to me and that\u2019s exactly what I plan to do, making no rush decisions,\u201d he said, adding he wanted time to seek advice. \u201cI deeply regret this.\u201d\n\nIn a letter this week, New Democrat MP Nathan Cullen accused Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of \u201cfalling short\u201d in bringing accountability to the Senate. Cullen called for new rules on removing senators who violate ethical standards.",

He is also no longer sitting on committees, but he\u2019s still a paid, sitting senator.\n\nSuspending him temporarily and stopping his paycheque would not be especially difficult, requiring a motion put to a vote.\n\nREAD MORE: Meredith broke code of conduct during alleged relationship with teenager, says ethics office\n\nBut such a suspension, like the ones imposed on senators Mike Duffy, Pamela Wallin and Patrick Brazeau a few years ago, only lasts until the end of the Parliamentary session. It must be renewed after each election if senators want it to remain in effect.\n\nThe Senate has very specific rules for when and how a member of the Upper Chamber should be dismissed permanently, losing the title of senator. In fact, it has never come to that.\n\nA permanent dismissal can be triggered in five situations under the Constitution Act, 1867:\n\nThe senator is absent for more than two consecutive sessions\n\nThe senator goes bankrupt\n\nThe senator does not meet residency or property qualifications in the province they represent\n\nThe senator declares their allegiance or adherence to a foreign power\n\nThe senator is found guilty of treason, or is convicted of a felony\n\nNone of these situations apply to Meredith. The Senate ethics committee is set to hold an emergency meeting on March 22 to discuss the unique case.\n\nNew territory\n\nAccording to Howard Leeson, a constitutional scholar and professor emeritus in Political Science at the University of Regina, the Senate finds itself in uncharted territory, and it will have to adapt.\n\n\u201cReally, the governing convention here would be that any House has the right to judge its own members, and to have procedures by which they are disciplined, and/or punished and/or even expelled,\u201d Leeson said.\n\nThe Senate therefore has the power to dismiss Meredith as a result of his behaviour, Leeson explained, but there\u2019s no clear process in place to do it \u2014 at least not yet.\n\nREAD MORE: Senate committee slams Liberals on infrastructure plan\n\n\u201cThey would want to have what you and I would call a \u2018full process.\u2019 They have the ethics report already, so they have a lot of detail, but there would have to be a process by which they develop some rules or regulations for expulsion,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThere would have to be a hearing, and evidence presented again at the hearing \u2026 and then a motion would have to come to the Senate floor and it would have to be supported by a majority in the House.\u201d\n\nThe only recourse for Meredith, if the Senate went that route, would be the courts, Leeson added.\n\n\u201cBut I suspect that the courts would simply say, \u2018No, this is entirely up to the House, this is a matter of privilege.'\u201d\n\nA dangerous precedent?\n\nBut forcing Meredith out using that privilege would undoubtedly set a precedent, and future senators could possibly be expelled for reasons that don\u2019t pass the smell test.\n\n\u201cSuch as \u2018I don\u2019t like your views on this or that. Let\u2019s get rid of all of the opposition,'\u201d Leeson said. \u201cIt then transgresses the whole concept of privilege.\u201d\n\nSo what else might the Senate do?\n\nAccording to a report from the CBC Tuesday, some senators are so incensed by Meredith\u2019s behaviour that they have asked their law clerk to look further into Section 18 of the Constitution Act.\n\nThe section states that Canadian parliamentarians have all the \u201cprivileges, immunities or powers \u2026 enjoyed, and exercised by the Commons House of Parliament in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.\u201d\n\nIn Britain, MPs can oust a member of the House of Commons with a majority vote in favour of a motion to remove that person. Section 18 seems to imply that Canadian senators could have that same power.\n\nREAD MORE: Here\u2019s what Canadian senators spend your money on\n\nIf Meredith decides to remain in office, this may be an option available to the Senate to forcibly remove him without introducing a whole new process.\n\nAt age 52, Meredith still has 23 years left before the mandated retirement age of 75. Whether he stays, is kicked out, or resigns, the Senate has confirmed that he will still qualify for a pension once he reaches age 60."

        "body1": "President Donald Trump's 2018 budget plan would end a program that provides funding for Meals on Wheels .\n\nA proposal of the Trump budget , released Thursday morning, calls for the complete elimination of the Community Development Block Grant program, which operates under the Department of Housing and Urban Development and covers Meals on Wheels. The budget plan estimates that cutting the program would save the government $3 billion.\n\n\"The Federal Government has spent over $150 billion on this block grant since its inception in 1974, but the program is not well-targeted to the poorest populations and has not demonstrated results,\" the draft of the budget says.\n\nA representative for Meals on Wheels said not enough details were provided to discern how this budget would impact the program, but that \"it is difficult to imagine a scenario in which they will not be significantly and negatively impacted.\"\n\nAt a press briefing Thursday, President Trump's Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney characterized the proposal as \"compassionate,\" because it would protect taxpayers from putting money toward inefficient or ineffective programs.\n\n\"You're only focusing on half the equation, you're focusing on the recipients of the money,\" he told reporters. \"We're trying to focus on the recipients of the money and the folks who give us the money in the first place. I think it's fairly compassionate for us to go and say, 'We're not going to ask for your money anymore unless we can guarantee to you your money is used in a proper function.'\"\n\nMeals on Wheels is one of the longest running programs in the Community Development Block Grant program, according to its website , and it served over 219 million meals to 2.4 million homebound senior citizens in 2016. The Community Development Block Grant program was established in 1974 and provides grants to state and local governments that provide assistance like Meals on Wheels, affordable housing services and natural disaster recovery in low income neighborhoods.\n\nIn a 2014 bipartisan resolution commemorating the 40th anniversary of the Community Development Block Grant program, Congress noted that between 2005 and 2013, the program provided services to over 100 million Americans and created or maintained 330,500 jobs.\n\nThis story has been updated to include comments from President Trump's Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney.", 
        "body0": "There is much about the Trump administration's actions and decisions that could reasonably concern one. The latest block of information to digest has been the budget blueprint, which is an unrealistic fiction of what the country needs and where to most effectively spend money.\n\nCriticism is fine and necessary. However, there is a tendency for people who oppose Trump, and, sadly, for journalists covering the administration, to jump into every utterance and decision with, as a public policy Spinal Tap think tank would say, the dial turned up to 11. A clear example is the claim in some media outlets that the proposed budget would kill Meals on Wheels.\n\nThe relevant Department of Housing and Urban Development section of the budget contains the following language:\n\nEliminates funding for the Community Development Block Grant program, a savings of $3 billion from the 2017 annualized CR level. The Federal Government has spent over $150 billion on this block grant since its inception in 1974, but the program is not well-targeted to the poorest populations and has not demonstrated results. The Budget devolves community and economic development activities to the State and local level, and redirects Federal resources to other activities.\n\nMeals on Wheels, a program that supports the delivery of meals to seniors who cannot afford food or cannot prepare it, started in Australia and has been in the United States since 1954. The program serves 2.4 million seniors every year and does get funding from the Community Development Block Grant program.\n\nBut the situation is complicated and saying that the budget eliminates the Meals on Wheels program is factually incorrect. According to the Meals on Wheels annual IRS filing for 2015 (it isn't a government program), approximately 3.3 percent of its funding comes from government sources. Most is from corporate and foundation grants, with individual contributions the second largest source. Government grants are actually the fifth largest source of revenue.\n\nIf its portions of block grants were eliminated, the program wouldn't suddenly disappear. However, the organization says that it already cannot keep up with growing demand from seniors who need help. In addition, Meals on Wheels passing funding down to 5,000 local groups that provide food, and they additionally might be affected by the funding cut.\n\nWill there be consequences for the program (and others, obviously)? Of course. However, resorting to hysteria is dangerous, and that is happening, both among many on the political left and some media outlets. Such statements can make valid criticism look uninformed and foolish.\n\nInstead, people who are concerned need to dig into the specifics of what is happening, understand the real implications, and then address those.\n\nErik Sherman writes about business, technology, economics, and public policy.

Once vehicles can communicate with each other \u2014 a capability expected in the next few years \u2014 other cars will be able to take appropriate maneuvers to avoid the drowsy driver.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn France, Valeo, another supplier of automotive technology, is developing an infrared camera system that will monitor children in the rear seat as well as the driver\u2019s shoulder, neck and head movements, looking for deviations from the norm.\n\nChecking body temperature and even how the driver is dressed, the system will also be able to customize the interior temperature for each driver, said Guillaume Devauchelle, the company\u2019s innovation director.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nNvidia, chip supplier to Audi, Mercedes, Tesla and others, is developing the Co-Pilot, an artificial-intelligence tool that can learn the behaviors of individual drivers and determine when they are operating outside their norms.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe system will eventually learn a driver\u2019s standard posture, head position, eye-blink rate, facial expression and steering style, among other indexes. Based on a vehicle\u2019s capabilities, the driver will be warned or automatically driven to a safe spot when conditions warrant.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nUntil vehicles can drive themselves, it will be up to drivers to pull over once they feel drowsy. But drivers tend to make excuses, believing there is no danger because they are just a few minutes from home, or they are not really as tired as they may feel.\n\n\u201cThe more tired you are, the less able you are to change your behavior,\u201d such as by pulling off the road for a short rest, said Mikael Ljung Aust, a technical specialist working on drowsiness mitigation technologies at Volvo\u2019s Safety Center in Gothenburg, Sweden.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nTo encourage drowsy drivers to take a break, Volvo, with a grant from the European Commission, is studying the effects of offering drivers free coffee once erratic steering wheel movements, lane departures and other signs detect that they are falling asleep, using the navigation system to direct them to the nearest coffee stop.\n\nPhoto\n\nAudi is faced with a unique problem because of its scheduled introduction next year of a car capable of driving up to 35 miles per hour without any driver intervention. When its Traffic Jam Pilot feature is engaged, the vehicle will need to determine if a driver is alert enough to take control after being a passive passenger for long periods.\n\nThrough its Driver Availability Detection system, sensors will scan the head and face to ensure that the eyes are open and the driver is alert before the car turns over the steering wheel.\n\nAdvanced drowsiness detection systems exist today. For example, Mercedes\u2019s Attention Assist monitors a driver\u2019s behavior for the first 20 minutes behind the wheel to get a baseline of behaviors. Then, the system checks those against as many as 90 indexes, such as steering wheel angle, lane deviation and external factors such as wind gusts and pothole avoidance.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe system can currently detect drowsiness with 80 percent accuracy, said Christoph von Hugo, head of active safety for Mercedes-Benz. If drowsiness is detected, the driver is alerted to the nearest rest stop.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nFor the past decade Volvo has offered its Driver Alert system. \u201cTo detect drowsiness, we study the car, not the driver,\u201d said Mr. Aust of Volvo, looking at differences in the ability of the car to stay in lane, and other factors.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe system detects drowsiness with 97 percent accuracy, Mr. Aust said.\n\nWhile N.H.T.S.A. reported 824 deaths in 2015 because of drowsiness, that number is likely to be considerably higher, the agency said. Drowsy driving can only be self-reported and not measured like drunkenness. Also, drowsiness is not reported when it is a complication of other factors like excessive drinking.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re a nation of tired drivers. People talk about sleep deprivation as if it\u2019s a badge of honor,\u201d said Deborah Hersman, the head of the National Safety Council and the former chairwoman of the National Transportation Safety Board. \u201cAs a society we have to realize that drowsy driving is really dangerous.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nUntil fully autonomous vehicles are a reality, \u201cdrowsiness is something everyone needs to worry about,\u201d said Mark R. Rosekind, former head of N.H.T.S.A. and an expert on human fatigue. \u201cOur tendency is to say we\u2019re wide-awake when in reality we can fall asleep in a second.\u201d\n\nStill, the obvious solution for a driver who feels fatigued is to pull over and rest. According to Mr. Rosekind, studies with airline pilots show that those who took a nap for 26 minutes improved their performance by 34 percent and alertness by 54 percent, compared with those who did not.\n\nRegardless of how good technology is at detecting drowsiness, fighting off sleep is futile. Because sleep is a biological need, the best solution for drivers is still a low-tech one: Pull over and take a nap."

It concerns me that this call for a name change is based on factual misinformation,\" she said.\n\nBeyak went on to argue, citing a Toronto writer, that residential schools were already in place when Langevin was a civil servant, and he and others in the same time period should be judged according to the values of their time.\n\n\"Our forefathers who were involved with residential schools -- some may even be related to you -- were well-intentioned for the most part, and those who were not should be forgiven. As with everything in life, forgiveness will go a long way in the process of reconciliation,\" Beyak said.\n\nGoal was to 'take me away from my family'\n\nBeyak, through her office, declined an interview request.\n\n\"Senator Beyak has nothing further to add to her remarks in the Senate Tuesday, wherein she commented on both the negatives and positives of the residential school system,\" her spokeswoman wrote in an email to CTV News.\n\nSaganash, a survivor of the residential school system, asked Indigenous and Northern Affairs Minister Carolyn Bennett whether she'd agree to call for Beyak's resignation.\n\n\"I was also shocked when I heard what Senator Beyak said,\" Saganash said in question period in the House of Commons. The goal of the system, he said, was to \"take me away from my family, my culture, my language and my land,\" calling it \"a form of cultural genocide.\"\n\n\"There's never a good side to genocide,\" Saganash said.\n\nBennett declined to answer, saying it's up to the Indigenous community to decide whether they want an apology or Beyak's resignation.\n\nNew Democrat MP Georgina Jolibois said Beyak's views are sickening.\n\n\"Children were forcibly taken from their families and homes for the exact purpose of trying to wipe out their languages and their identities. Will this government stand with us to condemn and denounce the statements made by Senator Beyak\" Jolibois said.\n\n'Ill-informed'\n\nBennett agreed, calling Beyak's comments \"ill-informed, offensive and simply wrong.\"\n\n\"The senator's comments underscore the need for better education so that all Canadians can work together to advance the shared journey of reconciliation,\" she said.\n\n\"Survivors' families and communities are still dealing with the intergenerational trauma resulting from Indian residential schools. We must all be united in supporting them.\"\n\nIt's not the first time Beyak has made controversial remarks. On Feb. 28, she questioned the need to add protection for transgender people in the Canadian Human Rights Act and advised people in the LGBTQ community not to draw attention to themselves, citing friends of hers.\n\n\"By living in quiet dignity, they have never had to face any kind of discrimination or uncomfortable feelings. I would assert that is how the vast majority of the LGBT community feels,\" Beyak said.\n\n\"Sadly, we only focus on the vocal minority. Our school curriculum is now so crowded there is little time to teach our children the three Rs: reading, writing and arithmetic... Yet we teach them how to put condoms on cucumbers or question whether they want to be a boy or girl before they are even old enough to understand what the difference really is.

Alisson has been quite good this season in limited minutes, but Roma must be airtight in the back if they want to come out of this match with a win. Will Spalletti mess up the balancing act that he\u2019s played by giving Alisson and Wojciech Szcz\u0119sny minutes in different competitions to make sure that Roma has another match to play?\n\nHow much squad rotation will we see?\n\nIt\u2019s evident that Roma\u2019s burdensome schedule has started to take a toll on the workhorses of the club. In recent games players have looked tired from the first minute, resulting in a loss of defensive cohesiveness and mental fortitude. Luciano Spalletti finally rotated his squad against Palermo, debuting a new-look lineup with Stephan El Shaarawy up front. How many changes will we see in the squad this time around? How many changes should we see in the squad this time around?\n\nThe narrative of the entire season hangs on this match. If Roma pulls off a come-from-behind win, they still have a decent chance at European glory, and any season which adds a trophy to the cabinet is a good one for Roma fans. If Roma loses, however, we might just see another exodus from Trigoria."

        "body2": "\"Even though they\u2019re the First Family, they're a normal family. They have the same problems everyone else has, just in the limelight,\" director Jon Cassar tells THR.\n\nThe Kennedys: After Camelot stars Katie Holmes and Matthew Perry were among those who turned out Wednesday night at the Paley Center for Media in Beverly Hills for the premiere of their Reelz miniseries.\n\nThe mini, based on the J. Randy Taraborrelli's best-selling book After Camelot: Personal History of the Kennedy Family 1968 to the Present, stars Holmes as Jackie Kennedy Onassis and Perry as Ted Kennedy. It picks up where the 2011 miniseries The Kennedys ended, with the assassination of Robert F. Kennedy.\n\n\"We felt pressure [over] the last one we did [original series The Kennedys] \u2026 where the family did exercise some pressure indirectly that caused our show to be dropped from the History Channel,\" executive producer Michael Prupas told The Hollywood Reporter. \"In redoing it again, we're showing that we stood up for that and were able to win some Emmy Awards with that first show and we have virtually the same team together.\"\n\nThe original series was slated to air on the History Channel. After the political left and Kennedy historians raised some concerns over the show's accuracy, the network dropped the series, which was subsequently be picked up by Reelz channel, where it set a network ratings record.\n\nAfter reading Taraborrelli's book, executive producer Keri Selig tracked down the author and brought this project to Muse Entertainment. While she enjoyed learning about the Kennedys' lives post-RFK\u2019s assassination, it was Jackie\u2019s story that made Selig determined to bring this book to life onscreen.\n\n\"To see her have to survive, post this whole Camelot \u2026 it really humanizes her. Her family is an extraordinary family. It was the most female empowering role of a lifetime for me. I wanted to tell her story. She\u2019s a survivor and a winner,\" Selig said.\n\nReprising her iconic role as First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis is Holmes, who not only stars in the series but also directs the third of the four hours of the show, a role she felt ready for.\n\n\"t was really exciting to bring my ideas to the table,\" Holmes told THR, adding that of her second time playing Jackie: \"This was more of a different character completely. She was more of an innocent in the last series. She really became a real strong woman in this one.\"\n\nAlso stepping into the Kennedy shoes is Perry, who both stars as Sen. Ted Kennedy and serves as an executive producer of the series. Unfazed by the iconic name of his character, Perry found the challenge of portraying a role that transcends his previous works as one of the main reasons for taking on this project.\n\n\"I didn\u2019t feel pressure [taking on role]. I just looked at it as an opportunity to do something different that I've ever done. I wanted to make sure that I didn\u2019t do a Ted Kennedy impression, but brought some of myself to the role,\" Perry told THR.\n\nAlso joining the show is actress Kristin Hager, who found her role as Joan Kennedy a challenge, for her character endures demons that the public wasn't able to understand.\n\n\"It was a really challenging role to take on, because she had such a hard life. Anytime you're playing someone that is real person, there\u2019s so much pressure. It can be daunting,\" said Hager. \"She [Joan Kennedy] was ill-prepared for that kind of life. I think that's why she ended up where she was. She was a very private person who wasn't ready to live such a public life.\"\n\nWhile the Kennedys are one of history's most written-about families, the cast and crew believed that the series showed an authenticity to the family's story and explored their identities that were overshadowed by the Kennedy name.\n\n\"America has only really had one royal family and that's the Kennedys,\" said Kristin Booth, who reprises her role as Ethel Kennedy. \"We always have this idea in our day and age in social media \u2026 like this expectation that everything has to be perfect and everyone has to look a certain way and be a certain way, but really when the cameras are down and the lights are off and the doors are closed, they're just human and they are flawed. What I love about the new series is that we depict these people as human, with their flaws ... and how they navigate life in dealing with these things.\"\n\nReturning director Jon Cassar expressed the same sentiments about the family's realism.\n\n\"What I love as a director is that you strip down the fact that they're the First Family \u2026 their family stories aren't that much different from the people that are out there,\" he said. \"Even though they're the first family, they're a normal family amazingly enough. They have the same problems everyone else has, just in the limelight.\"\n\nWhen asked what audience members should take away from the series, Holmes believes that the underlying power of the Kennedys was their ability to stay united as a family.\n\n\"I hope that they take away that no one is perfect, no family is perfect. It's important to stay together as a family,\" she said.\n\nAfter screening a preview of the first episode, the cast sat onstage to answer questions from moderator and KTLA reporter Sam Rubin and audience members.\n\nThe first part of The Kennedys: After Camelot premieres Sunday, April 2 at 9 p.m. ET/6 p.m. PT on Reelz. The two-hour conclusion will air on Sunday, April 9, at the same time."
