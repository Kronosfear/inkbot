        "Just a few days ago, when the struggling Montreal Canadiens schlepped into Boston for their last game before their bye week, many in the Garden press box mused about the wild idea of recently deposed Bruins' coach Claude Julien replacing the beleaguered Michael Therrien.\n\nWell, that crazy scenario is now exactly what has transpired.\n\nAfter the Bruins, helmed by interim head coach Bruce Cassidy, embarrassed the Canadiens 4-0 at the Garden on Sunday, Montreal general manager Marc Bergevin decided to fire Therrien today and replace him with Julien, who was fired from his 10-year run as B's coach just a week ago today.\n\nThis will be Julien's second stint as Montreal coach. He coached the Habs from 2002-06, with his team upsetting the favored B's in a seven-game playoff series in 2004.\n\n‚ÄúI would like to sincerely thank Michel for his relentless work with the Montreal Canadiens over his eight seasons behind the bench, including the last five seasons when we worked together,\" Therrien said in a statement. \"The decision to remove Michel from his coaching duties was a difficult one because I have lots of respect for him. I came to the conclusion that our team needed a new energy, a new voice, a new direction. Claude Julien is an experienced and well respected coach with a good knowledge of the Montreal market. Claude has been very successful as an NHL coach and he won the Stanley Cup. Today, we hired the best available coach, and one of the league's best. I am convinced that he has the capabilities to get our team back on the winning track.\"\n\nJulien, of course, coached in Boston from 2007-2017 and won more games than any other coach that has led the Bruins. He compiled a 419-246-94 record and a .614 winning percentage behind the Bruins' bench.\n\nCoincidentally, it was Therrien's Canadiens who started Julien's Bruins on the down-slide, when the Habs upset the Presidents Trophy-winning B's in the second round of the 2013-14 playoffs. They have not made the playoffs since then and, with the possibility of a third straight DNQ looming, B's GM Don Sweeney fired Julien last week.\n\nThe B's and Habs have finished their season series, so the only way they could meet this year would be in the playoffs.\n\nBut Lord knows, stranger things have happened.", 
        "\n\nCTV Montreal\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Montreal Canadiens have fired Michel Therrien as head coach and replaced him with Claude Julien.\n\nGeneral Manager Marc Bergevin made the surprise announcement Tuesday afternoon.\n\n\"I came to the conclusion that our team needed a new energy, a new voice, a new direction,\" said Bergevin in a written statement.\n\nHe added he was hiring \"the best available coach, and one of the league's best. I am convinced that he has the capabilities to get our team back on the winning track.\"\n\nThe Canadiens are not making any more statements about the decision until Wednesday.\n\nThierren coached the Canadiens for the past eight years and was frequently criticized for his decisions, especially last season when the Canadiens performed abysmally following an injury that took Carey Price off the ice for months.\n\nThe Canadiens began the current season in spectacular fashion but have done very poorly since early January. They have lost 12 of their last 17 games, although they remain in first place in the Atlantic Division of the Eastern Conference.\n\nJulien was fired as head coach of the Boston Bruins exactly one week ago after nearly ten years with the team.\n\nJulien had great success with the Bruins in his first years with the team, including winning the Stanley Cup in 2011, but in the past two years the Bruins failed to make the playoffs and this year the Bruins are at risk of not making the playoffs.\n\nThis is the second time Julien has coached the Canadiens, and that time, he also replaced Therrien.\n\nThat transition occured in 2002 when the Canadiens were in the middle of a losing stretch. At that point Julien lasted until 2006.",

        "PSG dominated Barcelona on Tuesday in the Champions League Round of 16 first leg, as Angel Di Maria scored twice in a 4-0 victory. The French giants, who have had their fair share of trouble with Barca in recent editions of the competition, thoroughly outplayed the Spanish club from start to finish to secure the impressive yet mostly unexpected result.\n\nWith its high pressure confusing the Barca defense and its sound marking resulting in Lionel Messi, Neymar and Luis Suarez doing next to nothing, the capital club has one foot in the quarterfinals after securing one of the biggest results in its history.\n\nHere's what you need to know.\n\nFirst half\n\nThe first half (the game, actually) was all PSG. Barcelona didn't look anything like its normal, dangerous, world class self as PSG outclassed the visitors with a very high and aggressive press, time and time again and took a 2-0 lead into the break.\n\nBarcelona were stripped of their usual dominance of possession and did not have a reaction for it as PSG got more and more comfortable as the game wore on.\n\nPSG threatened a handful of times against an uninspired Barca defense, and it was Di Maria who got things going with a brilliant free kick goal on 18 minutes.\n\nBirthday boy Angel Di Maria spreads the love on #Valentines Day with this free kick goal vs Barcelona. üíôüíô #UCLhttps://t.co/jd7y1BqG8h ‚Äî FOX Soccer (@FOXSoccer) February 14, 2017\n\nJulian Draxler then made it 2-0 late in the first half with a fine strike on the right side of the box, leaving Barcelona stunned.\n\nJulian Draxler this season:\n\n\n\n0 goals in 14 matches for Wolfsburg.\n\n5 goals in 9 matches for PSG. üò≥ #PSGFCB#UCLhttps://t.co/ETnEg8z6QC ‚Äî FOX Soccer (@FOXSoccer) February 14, 2017\n\nIf it weren't for Barca goalkeeper Marc-Andre Ter Stegen, it could have been 3-0 or 4-0 at the half, but PSG still entered the break with an impressive lead.\n\nSecond half\n\nIt was more of the same. PSG knocked on the door often and got another unbelievable goal from Di Maria before the hour mark to make it 3-0.\n\nCan you feel the love, Paris?\n\n\n\nDi Maria is going OFF on #Valentines Day, breaking Barcelona's hearts. #PSGFCB#UCLhttps://t.co/j9gHtsVe1I ‚Äî FOX Soccer (@FOXSoccer) February 14, 2017\n\nEdinson Cavani then scored on 70 minutes off a lovely counter attack to complete the dominant scoreline.

Sure, this team can come back and do the same to PSG in the return leg, but it did nothing on Tuesday to show it could. PSG has to feel great about its chances of advancing.\n\nNo team has ever come back from 4-0 down in the aggregate score in Champions League history.\n\nWhen is the return leg?\n\nMarch 8 at 2:45 p.m. ET from Camp Nou in Barcelona, Spain.\n\nRelive the match with our live blog below.",

(Source: Reuters)\n\n‚ÄúWhat just happened?‚Äù is what everyone except PSG fans watching this match would have been thinking. PSG may be a team that could rival Barcelona in the transfer market but they were never considered equal to the Catalan giants on the pitch. Today, they have absolutely smashed that notion out of the park.\n\nThe birthday boys Edinson Cavani and Angel Di Maria are on the score sheet alongwith Julian Draxler, making his Champions League debut with PSG. Another standout performer has been 21-year-old French full back Adrien Rabiot who, alongwith Marco Verratti managed to keep a lid on the fabled Barcelona mid field.\n\nIf any team can score at least four goals in 90 minutes to win a match, it is Barcelona and that is exactly what they will need to do when they host their conquerors at the Nou Camp. They have turned around a two-goal deficit earlier in 2013 when they won the return leg 4-2. That was against an AC Milan side that was slowly dipping in stature in Europe. This is against a resurgent PSG.\n\n0005 hrs IST: The UEFA Champions League is back and off with a cracker. On one hand PSG host Catalan giants Barcelona. Barca have recently found a resurgence in their league form chiefly due to their fabulous ‚ÄòMSN‚Äô trio‚Äôs contributions up front. Coupled with a formidable defensive line led by Gerard Pique, Barca will be looking to show that they are the dominant side even when up against the cash rich Paris St. Germain, who themselves have seen a spike in their domestic form.\n\nBorrusia Dortmund have had a two-faced season. On one hand, they will have to be content with fighting for Champions League spots in the Bundesliga after dropping out of the title race long time back. On the other, they have been enjoying a scintillating run in Europe so far and have entered the Round of 16 as winners of their group ahead of Real Madrid.\n\n0045 hrs IST: Team News, Barca XI: Ter Stegen, Piqu√©, Busquets, Iniesta, Su√°rez, Messi, Neymar, Alba, S.

Andres Iniesta is the man with the armband for Barcelona and Blaise Matuidi leads PSG.\n\n0117 hrs IST: At Lisbon, Benfica and Dortmund have kicked off with Benfica earning an early corner. It comes to nothing and Dortmund broke away with a quick counter. It seemed like they would make it count but Benfica managed to clear the final shot taken by Aubameyang\n\n0120 hrs IST: Barcelona had a free kick that was swung into the box by Lionel Messi. Busquets was the target but PSG managed to clear it and broke away with he counter. They had outnumbered Barca in their own half and Andre Ter Stegen did some intelligent sweeping job for the Catalans.\n\n0122 hrs IST: PSG are dominating play and Edinson Cavani had probably the best chance of the match. Julian Draxler lofted the ball to Cavani who came in behind Sergi Roberto. The Uruguayan was offside but the flag stayed down. Roberto then held his ground and blocked the shot.\n\n0125 hrs IST: At Lisbon, Dortmund took the ball from Benfica at a dangerous part of the pitch. Aubameyang was unmarked and had ample space through the middle and received the ball but in the end skied the shot.\n\n0130 hrs IST: That was another good chance for PSG when Matuidi managed to get into a relatively empty Barca box from the left. He took the shot and it would have gone in had it not been for a sensational one-handed save from Andre Ter Stegen. PSG have Barca on the ropes\n\n0133 hrs IST: Neymar seems to have a niggle. Meanwhile Julian Draxler is brought down just outside the box Umtiti. It‚Äôs taken by Di Maria and he SCORES! A beautiful free kick that was curled behind the wall and Ter Stegen who has done a fine job so far, stood no chance. PSG are leading Barcelona and it is an indication of how the match has gone thus far. They have pulled ahead in the 17th minute.\n\n0139 hrs IST: The first real opening that Barca had. Neymar avoids a challenge that came on him and ran into space towards the centre. He then found Andre Gomes who got in behind the PSG defence line and was in the clear. He couldn‚Äôt keep the shot away from the keeper.\n\n0148 hrs IST: 30 mins have gone by and it‚Äôs PSG 1-0 Barcelona. The home side have been the dominant team as the scoreline shows. Barca have just started to get the ball into the good areas with Neymar being their best player in attack so far. But overall, Barca have been saved from being embarassed in this first half hour by Andre Ter Stegen.\n\n0156 hrs IST: GOAL!! Julian Draxler scores in the 39th minute. They have been devastating on the counter with Draxler and Di Maria using their pace to catch out the Barca defence. Both of them are now on the score card. Draxler has already scored his fifth goal since his move, but this one has to be the special one for him.\n\n0201 hrs IST: That‚Äôs half time!! PSG lead Barca by two goals to none. It has been a first half that few would have expected would pan out in this manner but it has. Only Neymar has been able to do anything meaningful with the ball as both Messi and Suarez have been pretty much anonymous in this first half. Can Luis Enrique inspire his side into performing the way we know them to in the second half?\n\n0207 hrs IST: At Lisbon, its goalless at half time but that doesn‚Äôt tell the story of the match. Dortmund have been dominant and Pierre Emerick Aubameyang has had some very good chances thus far.\n\n0217 hrs IST: The teams have come out. PSG have a spring in their steps while Barca have scowls on their faces. Barca immediately give away a free kick. Its not come to anything but the visitors had to do some more nervous defensive work before the danger was gone.\n\n0222 hrs IST: Benfica have score in Lisbon, the home side have been dominant since the second half began and have been rewarded with a goal. Mitroglou is the man with the goal in the 48th minute. He headed in a lose ball that came off the keeper‚Äôs gloves from a free kick into the empty net.\n\n0227 hrs IST: GOAL!! Di Maria (54‚Ä≤), an absolute belter!! PSG are not letting go of it and are pummeling the Barcelona defence. Di Maria got the ball some way outside the box at the end of another quick counter attack. He went for it and it curl into the top half of the net. Di Maria is reminding Barcelona what they used to face in El Clasico‚Äôs\n\n0233 hrs IST: Angel Di Maria goes off to a standing ovation. The Argentine has scored two stunners to put PSG ahead and the man to replace him is Brazilian Lucas.\n\n0241 hrs IST: Marco Verratti has come off for PSG as the midfielder had went down. Unai Emery does not take any chances and replaces him immediately. Verratti has been instrumental so far in keeping Iniesta and Messi at bay.\n\n0243 hrs IST: GOAL!! Edinson Cavani (72‚Ä≤). Another counter attack and Cavan manages to get the ball with Pique, for a change unable to get to him in time. Cavani almost caressed the ball to Ter Stegen‚Äôs left and it goes into goal. This is turning out to be a dream night for PSG and a Parisian nightmare for the Catalan giants, who are now facing a real possibility of a Round of 16 exit from the Champions League.\n\n0253 hrs IST: Barcelona‚Äôs attacking super powers have been completely undone. It has been a rare lacklustre performance from Messi who is now trying to work something out for Barcelona. They had the best chance of the match when Messi curled in a corner, Pique headed it to Umtiti whose header hit the cross bar. Just a reminder to PSG that they are facing Barcelona after all.\n\n0258 hrs IST: The Parc des Princes rises once again as Julian Draxler is taken off. The German has had a dream European debut with PSG and is replaced by Javier Pastore.\n\n0301 hrs IST: In Lisbon, Benfica have managed to maintain their one goal despite the number of chances Dortmund have had. This includes a penalty from Pierre Emerick Aubameyang that was saved by the home team goalkeeper.\n\n0303 hrs IST: Barcelona got a free kick from just outside, almost from where Di Maria scored the first goal in the first half. Neymar was the man who took it and was unable to emulate the Argentine and hits it over. It has not been Barca‚Äôs night.\n\n0306 hrs IST: It has ended and the score is, believe it or not, Paris St. Germain 4-0 Barcelona. The full time whistle also goes off at Lisbon with Benfica managing to hold off Borrusia Dortmund to win the first leg 1-0.\n\n¬© The Indian Express Online Media Pvt Ltd",

        "The lead the Montreal Canadiens built at the start of the year is starting to crumble a little bit. With one win in their last seven games, a 3-6-1 record in their last 10, and a 4-0 shutout defeat against the Bruins on Sunday still lingering, it‚Äôs not a surprise the jitters are alive and well in Montreal.\n\nIt is, after all, how their slide out of the playoffs started last year. Carey Price was missing due to injury, of course, but it‚Äôs an all-too-familiar song for the Canadiens. Which is why fans are starting to, once again, clamor for the release of head coach Michel Therrien.\n\nBob McKenzie made an appearance on TSN‚Äôs Montreal 690 show on Monday, the start of the Canadiens‚Äô five-day break, and noted that it may be time for Montreal general manager Marc Bergevin to get the ball rolling on something.\n\n‚ÄúThey‚Äôve been playing too poorly for too long to assume that getting a five-day rest is going to make anything better, I would think. Unless I‚Äôm really missing the mark here. So no, I think it‚Äôs probably time for Marc Bergevin to do something. And everybody has got different opinions.‚Äù\n\nFiring the coach is an option, as the Islanders, Panthers, Blues, and Bruins can attest to. Since firing Claude Julien, Boston is on a three-game win streak. The Islanders climbed back into the playoff race after canning Jack Capuano. Both St. Louis and Florida found immediate success, as well, after dismissing Ken Hitchcock and Gerard Gallant respectively.\n\nMcKenzie noted, however, that firing Therrien is likely the easy option for the Canadiens, but maybe the wrong one. In fact, a trade is likely on the mind of Bergevin, who has stated time and time again that he stands by his head coach.\n\n‚ÄúBut I‚Äôve said it before and I‚Äôll say it again: I don‚Äôt think this is a situation where the general manager is contemplating a coaching change. But he most certainly has to be contemplating a trade. And I think if anything ‚Äî and this is just my opinion, this is not based on inside information or something that I‚Äôm predicting is about to happen ‚Äî I‚Äôm saying that if I‚Äôm Marc Bergevin, my desire to make a trade and to perhaps give up future assets for something that makes a difference now would be pretty high this week.‚Äù\n\nThe Canadiens have been linked to the Coyotes and Martin Hanzal over the past few weeks, but the Avalanche are also likely in the mix, according to McKenzie. After all, Colorado general manager Joe Sakic was in attendance for the Bruins and Canadiens game on Sunday. Sakic and Boston general manager Don Sweeney were seen publicly talking in the press box, so who knows if Bergevin was also approached during the game.\n\nMatt Duchene and Gabriel Landeskog are the big names on the market, and according to McKenzie, the Canadiens would have to give up a combination of Michael McCarron, Mikhail Sergachev, Noah Juulsen, and Nikita Scherbak to get it done.\n\n‚ÄúBecause we‚Äôre dealing with Colorado, the expectation is there‚Äôs going to be multiple pieces involved. And I‚Äôm not saying everyone of those guys would be gone, but you know what? If you‚Äôre making a trade for Matt Duchene, I‚Äôm betting Colorado is insisting on at least two of those, not to mention a first-round pick or what have you. Because Colorado‚Äôs price for a guy like Duchene, or Landeskog, has been three or four high-end pieces. And what they‚Äôre really after is a 20-something ‚Äî and I say 20-something (meaning) lower 20s ‚Äî somebody who is already established in the National Hockey League. Somebody who has played games and is NHL-ready right now.‚Äù\n\nIt‚Äôs not a shock that‚Äôd be the running price for Duchene or Landeskog. The Bruins are currently debating if 20-year-old shutdown defenseman Brandon Carlo is a worthwhile trade piece with the blue-line talent they have coming up the pipeline in the next few years.\n\nAll four of the Canadiens reported prospects are former first-round picks, with defenseman Sergachev being the big draw as the No. 9 pick in the 2016 draft. Sergachev, McCarron, and Scherbak have a small handful of NHL experience, and it‚Äôd be a question whether the Avalanche organization believes any of them to be NHL-ready.\n\nAlso to consider for the Canadiens is whether a combination of prospects and a likely first-round pick is worth it for Duchene or Landeskog. Both are 26-years-old and under, and would slide immediately into the Canadiens‚Äô top-six, bumping them from playoff contender to potential Stanley Cup contender.\n\nMcKenzie isn‚Äôt the only NHL insider who believes Bergevin will be active during the Canadiens‚Äô break. On Monday, Elliotte Friedman added more fuel to the fire near the end of his hit on Calgary‚Äôs Sportsnet 960 show.\n\n‚ÄúI really think this week Montreal ‚Äî Marc Bergevin has some decisions to make. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised at all if he‚Äôs the big newsmaker this week.‚Äù\n\nFriedman also has put forth the idea that Alex Galchenyuk might be a piece going the other way should both sides find common ground in his latest 30 Thoughts column.", 
        "The Montreal Canadiens are limping into their five-day bye week following a 4-0 loss to the Boston Bruins Sunday.\n\nWhile the 31-19-8 Canadiens are still in first place in the Atlantic Division, their lead has dwindled after having lost six of their past seven games.\n\nClearly, their play has not been good enough.\n\n‚ÄúEveryone has to improve their game,‚Äù said Canadiens captain Max Pacioretty, via Pat Hickey of The Montreal Gazette. ‚ÄúTonight, we had a couple of breakdowns and the game got out of hand. Everybody talks about the schedule and fatigue but every (team) is dealing with the same thing. Everyone has to man-up and worry about their own game.\n\n‚ÄúWe‚Äôre getting paid a lot of money and everyone has to try to make a difference,‚Äù added Pacioretty. ‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt be content eating up minutes and dumping the puck in.‚Äù\n\nNHL Insider Bob McKenzie made a Monday morning radio appearance on Montreal‚Äôs TSN 690, and didn‚Äôt agree with a notion presented to him that perhaps this was solely a case of the team needing some time off.\n\n‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think you can just say, ‚ÄòWe‚Äôll be okay. We‚Äôll take a five-day break and when we come back everybody will be fresh and it‚Äôll be different,‚Äô‚Äù noted McKenzie. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôve been playing too poorly for too long to assume that getting a five-day rest is going to make anything better, I would think. Unless I‚Äôm really missing the mark here.\n\n‚ÄúSo no, I think it‚Äôs probably time for Marc Bergevin to do something. And everybody has got different opinions.\n\nWhat should Marc Bergevin do? ‚Äî Tony Marinaro (@TonyMarinaro) February 13, 2017\n\n‚ÄúI saw Tony Marinaro has got his own poll on Twitter there of what should be done. It looked like ‚ÄòFire Therrien‚Äô was at the top of the list for most fans, which is not unusual when you get an owly fan base. The easy one to do is fire the coach because first off, right now firing the coach in the National Hockey League is a very fashionable thing to do because Boston did it and they‚Äôve won three in a row. St. Louis did it and they‚Äôve been on a roll. The Islanders did it and they got on a roll. Although the funny thing is Jack Capuano was like 6-3-2 in his 11 games before he got fired. So sometimes you can go a little whacky trying to figure out the numbers.\n\n‚ÄúBut I‚Äôve said it before and I‚Äôll say it again: I don‚Äôt think this is a situation where the general manager is contemplating a coaching change. But he most certainly has to be contemplating a trade. And I think if anything ‚Äì and this is just my opinion, this is not based on inside information or something that I‚Äôm predicting is about to happen ‚Äì I‚Äôm saying that if I‚Äôm Marc Bergevin, my desire to make a trade and to perhaps give up future assets for something that makes a difference now would be pretty high this week.‚Äù\n\nFriedman: Bergevin ‚Äòready to swing for the fences‚Äô on trade front\n\nPart of the discussion on 690 included comparing last year‚Äôs standings swoon of the Canadiens with this year‚Äôs. It was noted that part of the reasoning around the blockbuster P.K. Subban-for-Shea Weber swap, as well as the ensuing changes, was that the Canadiens needed and would have a different identity and different leadership this season ‚Äì yet the struggles of the team remain similar in some fashion.\n\n‚ÄúThat‚Äôs part of the reason why when you make the trade for Subban for Weber and you give up the years that you‚Äôre giving up there, that signals a greater sense of immediacy,‚Äù pointed out McKenzie. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt trade a player of P.K. Subban‚Äôs age for a player of Shea Weber‚Äôs age and say, ‚ÄòWe‚Äôre still building slowly to something down the road.‚Äô Nuh-uh. Doesn‚Äôt work that way.\n\n‚ÄúSo again, that‚Äôs more reinforcement that I like say in for a dime, in for a dollar, or double down, or whatever you want to call it. That‚Äôs just one more signal to me that points to the Montreal Canadiens saying, ‚ÄòSitting on our hands is not an option.‚Äô\n\n‚ÄúNow, acting stupid ‚Äì and I understand the problem you run into if you‚Äôre Marc Bergevin. Especially when you‚Äôre a team like this where everybody wants to throw you an anchor instead of a life vest. The prices are high.\n\nMcKenzie on Canadiens‚Äô Galchenyuk: ‚ÄòI‚Äôd play the hell out of him‚Äô\n\n‚ÄúAnd I don‚Äôt know what specifically Colorado would want for Matt Duchene, but it‚Äôs going to be a lot. By the time it‚Äôs all said and done, whatever player Montreal is eyeing or thinking about or whatever moves they‚Äôre contemplating ‚Äì when you start looking at what they‚Äôve got as sort of the reservoir of young players or prospects, what you‚Äôre really talking about is some combination of McCarron or Sergachev or Juulsen or Scherbak.\n\n‚ÄúAnd because we‚Äôre dealing with Colorado, the expectation is there‚Äôs going to be multiple pieces involved. And I‚Äôm not saying everyone of those guys would be gone, but you know what? If you‚Äôre making a trade for Matt Duchene, I‚Äôm betting Colorado is insisting on at least two of those, not to mention a first-round pick or what have you.\n\n‚ÄúBecause Colorado‚Äôs price for a guy like Duchene, or Landeskog, has been three or four high-end pieces. And what they‚Äôre really after is a 20-something ‚Äì and I say 20-something (meaning) lower 20s ‚Äì somebody who is already established in the National Hockey League. Somebody who has played games and is NHL-ready right now.\n\n‚ÄúSo we saw Joe Sakic‚Äôs in Boston last night talking to Don Sweeney very publicly in the second intermission. Guys were taking pictures and selfies of them while they‚Äôre actually talking in the press box. And there‚Äôs no question if the Colorado Avalanche are going to trade Gabriel Landeskog, for example, to the Boston Bruins, there‚Äôs no question that they‚Äôre going to absolutely insist on Brandon Carlo being part of the deal. Quite aside from the fact that he‚Äôs from Colorado Springs, but he‚Äôs what ‚Äì a 20-year-old, going on 21-year-old, defenseman who‚Äôs proven that he‚Äôs an NHL defenseman right now.\n\n‚ÄúAnd the Avalanche don‚Äôt want to load up on a whole bunch of guys that have just been drafted at 18, although a guy like Sergachev may yet have appeal as part of a package. But what they‚Äôre really looking for is somebody who‚Äôs 20 or 21 or 22 or 23 that they can insert immediately into the lineup, along with a first-round pick and a couple of really good prospects.\n\n‚ÄúSo that‚Äôs why the prices are high and at some point here Montreal‚Äôs got to decide are they going to sit and watch the season slip away, or are they going to make a move.‚Äù\n\nSource: Montreal Gazette, TSN 690\n\nFor reference: Covering the Insiders",

        "What's better than scoring one goal against Barcelona in the Champions League on your birthday? Bagging a double.\n\nAngel Di Maria scored his second to give PSG a 3-0 lead on Barca in the round of 16 first leg on Tuesday, curling a gorgeous effort into the upper corner. After his free kick made it 1-0, Di Maria outdid himself on his birthday by scoring this beauty.\n\nGame over, possibly the tie. Di Maria with another beautiful goal to make it 3-0!! #PSGFCB ‚öΩ ... pic.twitter.com/cpfBb9B95v ‚Äî Ali (@ChocMilkSheikh1) February 14, 2017\n\nAnd that gave the French side a dominant lead against one of the top contenders for the crown. A birthday to remember.", 
        "The Argentine has been a decisive influence at the very top level before, and with Barcelona looming it seems he has rediscovered his motivation\n\nWhen Real Madrid won La Decima in 2014, the influence of Angel Di Maria was hailed as one of the major factors that allowed the Bernabeu side to create history. Named man of the match on the historic occasion they defeated city rivals Atletico, he was not to linger long in Spain, with a British record move to Manchester United following in August.\n\nDi Maria‚Äôs spell at Old Trafford, though, was troubled. He never settled under Louis van Gaal, and having been used in a variety of positions was one of the high-profile casualties of what proved to be a thoroughly miserable campaign.\n\n‚ÄúHe is one of the players who are in a row of players who have no self-criticism,‚Äù the Dutchman later stated, having been accused by his former charge of moving him around too much.\n\nSeeking gamebreakers to lift them to an elite level, Paris Saint-Germain were quick to pounce for the former Rosario and Benfica man, splashing out ¬£44 million on a player United had paid nearly ¬£60m for 12 months earlier.\n\nAfter making a bright start in France, he has endured a difficult second campaign and is only now beginning to get going again.\n\nA spectacular performance off the bench in Monaco on his PSG debut set the bar high. Given just 24 minutes to impress, he produced one fine assist and showed the kind of silky touches that had ultimately won him acclaim in Spain.\n\nEven if the rest of the season did not live up to that standard, it could be considered relatively strong. No-one could touch him when it came to setting up goals in Ligue 1 ‚Äì he created 18 in total, five more than his nearest rival and club-mate Zlatan Ibrahimovic. Additionally, he supplied two decisive passes as Chelsea were seen off in the Champions League last 16.\n\nNot necessarily signed as a goal scorer, he would contribute an impressive 15 times on that front.\n\nPSG could have struggled to ask for more as they claimed the domestic treble, with Di Maria performing well in a strong supporting cast around the Swede. This season, however, has been a different story.\n\nWith Ibrahimovic having left for the patch of Manchester that he found impossible win over, the 28-year-old was expected to step forward to become one of the stars of the team. Expectations heightened that he could contribute his regular scoring while maintaining his prolific rate of creating for others.\n\n'I have to score 100 goals before I can go' - Ibrahimovic\n\nUntil the last fortnight, that simply has not been the case.\n\nThe first half of the campaign finished with Di Maria having scored just three goals, including only one in the league, and having created seven more ‚Äì well down on his pace the previous year. He seemed to be slipping into the void that Zlatan left rather than filling it.\n\nIndeed, it was not until Julian Draxler arrived shortly after Christmas and threatened to take his place that the real Di Maria came to play.\n\nHead coach Unai Emery took the bold step of omitting him from his starting XI under the cover of squad rotation. In reality, it was an admission that Lucas Moura, himself a much-improved figure, and January signing Draxler had overtaken him in the pecking order.\n\nThe German‚Äôs arrival in Paris seems to have lit a fire under his rival, which bodes well for the conclusion to the campaign ‚Äì both at home and abroad.\n\nRonaldinho: PSG can test Barcelona\n\nHaving been alerted to the scale of his problems at PSG, Di Maria is threatening to rediscover the form that made him invaluable to Real Madrid in their clutch moments at the end of 2013-14. He was his side‚Äôs best player in the 2-1 win over Lille, and last Friday in Bordeaux, he both scored and created another.\n\nThomas Meunier is clear why there has been a sharp improvement from his South American cohort.\n\n‚ÄúThe competition,‚Äù the Belgian explained after the 3-0 success at Stade Matmut Atlantique at the weekend. ‚ÄúEveryone knows that places are expensive, that from one week to the next you could be on the bench or on the field.\n\n‚ÄúIf we want to have a chance to play games, we have to really work at training and in the games, to show we‚Äôre capable ‚Äì and that‚Äôs what happened.\n\n‚ÄúDraxler is a very, very good player, and everyone understands that. Angel, quite simply, he doesn‚Äôt want to be a substitute. He‚Äôs been metamorphosed. He is just putting a little more in.‚Äù\n\nDi Maria, it seems, is starting to show the fight that he was accused of lacking in Manchester, but how long he is prepared to show this level of motivation for is a question that can only be answered by time.\n\nCarlo Ancelotti, the man who, as Madrid boss, saw the best of the player during his blistering spell in the first half of 2014, did not exactly give him a rousing reference when he told Eurosport : \"Some players love to compete, others prefer to make more money. If a player needs motivation to play at the best club in the world, I have no problem in letting him go.\"\n\nNevertheless, the Bayern Munich boss would later praise the player for his unique ability to \"take matches by storm with his energy\". That, however, requires motivation, and that, it seems, it Di Maria's weakness.\n\nIf he is to re-emerge as a star capable of carrying PSG to the very top, as he did with Madrid, Tuesday‚Äôs Champions League meeting with Barcelona would be a great place to start - and if he needs any extra incentive to shine upon such a great stage, then his best days really are behind him.",

        "As the Champions League returns, let us consider one of elite European football's most persistent mysteries. More appalling than The Dabgrave Ritual, more controversial than The Salto Vampire. We refer, of course, to the Adventure of the Two Strikers.\n\nOver the last few years, in Paris, two forwards have been playing their trade. One is, frankly, a buffoon. He clanks around up front like a man who grew up believing that football was a game about missing the goal, has only just been informed of his mistake, and is losing the battle against his ingrained instincts. Sometimes the ball goes in, generally out of embarrassment. Mostly, he just looks confused, while his teammates shake their heads, the game slips away, and the word \"fraud\" gallops around the internet.\n\nThe other is pretty much a case study in how to do one's job. Whether we simply count his goals, or look to the more complex metrics such as xG (R^E, L7, eN variant)*, we find the same results. When played in his right position with decent support, he gets on the end of plenty of chances and he puts an acceptable proportion of them away. In short, he is extremely unfraudulent.\n\n* Expected goals, adjusted for the rotation of the earth, the moon's presence in the seventh house, and El Ni√±o.\n\nThe mystery is that both these players play for Paris Saint-Germain in the same position, at the same time, wearing the same numbered shirt and the same face. And are the same person: Edinson Cavani.\n\nThe internet isn't big enough to get to the bottom of the argument between those people who like to watch football with their eyes, and those people who distrust their lying eyes and like to watch football with their spreadsheets. But there are few footballers for whom the fraud/non-fraud argument is felt quite so sharply. And, as PSG's owners pursue the Champions League trophy that would validate their entire project, there are few for whom it's so important.\n\nLast November's Champions League game against Arsenal provided the perfect illustration of the problem. It is deeply unfortunate that a striker gets remembered for his misses in a game where he scored the opening goal, one that ultimately made the difference between a draw and a defeat. But Cavani missed four clear chances that night and, come the end of the group stage, PSG finished two points behind Arsenal. That's why they've landed Barcelona in the knockout stages; that's why Cavani will likely have to score plenty over the two legs.\n\n(The fact that Arsenal went on to draw Bayern Munich is irrelevant here, because when it comes to Champions League knockout draws Arsenal are cursed, whereas PSG are simply unlucky.)\n\nWhat makes the suggestions of fraudulence even sharper is the fact that Cavani, for a given value of perfect, looks perfect. Long hair, broad shoulders, cheekbones that should probably be illegal: He looks like an attempt to construct a footballing superhero from the ground up. \"Give me a brilliant, charismatic, intimidating striker who could also kill an elephant if he absolutely had to.\" So when this vision of footballing perfection misses a chance? It looks unshakably wrong.\n\nPerhaps this is where we can find the solution to our mystery. Cavani's heroic aspect comes with certain responsibilities. Strikers in his mold should express themselves through their shoulders, their sinews, and their sweat. They should howitzer their goals into the net from about 20 yards out, then whip their hair around and scream for the replays. Not all footballers can be Gabriel Batistuta; even the great man himself resorted to the occasional toe poke. But those that have the look simply must give it a go.\n\nThe fraud committed by Cavani isn't the usual combination of being (a) famous, (b) expensive, and (c) extremely well-paid while also being (d) secretly rubbish. Instead, it's one of presentation, of expectations. Though he has his spectacular moments, he spends most of his time playing a game antithetical to his bearing. He gets into clever positions, he moves intelligently off the ball, he peels away from defenders. All good stuff, all admirable. But all somehow inappropriate, from a man whose bearing promises to take on and overcome the laws of physics.\n\nSometimes he tucks away his chances, sometimes he doesn't. Either way, we the viewers are largely left bereft. Yet ultimately, he's the real victim here, the butt of some great cosmic joke. They took a striker who looks like the lovechild of Batistuta and Conan The Barbarian, and they made him play like Andy Cole. No wonder people get so angry.",

        "The Saskatchewan Roughriders made a big splash in CFL free agency Tuesday.\n\nAccording to a league source, the Riders landed American offensive lineman Derek Dennis. The CFL's outstanding lineman last season agree to terms with Saskatchewan hours after the noon ET start of the free agency period.\n\nThe move is a big one for Saskatchewan, which finished last in the West Division standings last year with a 5-13 record.\n\nThe six-foot-three, 340-pound Dennis anchored a Calgary offensive line that allowed the fewest sacks in the CFL (20) last season and helped pave the way for league rushing leader Jerome Messam.\n\nArgos sign QB Mathews\n\nThe Toronto Argonauts agreed to terms with free-agent quarterback Jeff Mathews on a two-year contract Tuesday.\n\nThe six-foot-four, 225-pound Mathews spent the last three seasons with the Hamilton Tiger-Cats playing for head coach Kent Austin, his former coach at Cornell.\n\nMathews, 25, completed 18-of-29 passes for 209 yards and a TD last year with Hamilton. He played a total of 10 games with the Ticats, completing 136-of-206 passes for 1,659 yards with seven TDs and nine interceptions.\n\nTicats sign DB Kanneh\n\nThe Hamilton Tiger-Cats bolstered their secondary with the signing of free-agent American defensive back Abdul Kanneh on Tuesday.\n\nKanneh spent the last three seasons with the Ottawa Redblacks, registering 138 tackles, 12 interceptions, three sacks and five forced fumbles.\n\nThe five-foot-10 defensive back helped Ottawa make consecutive Grey Cup appearances, winning last year's title 39-33 in overtime over Calgary.\n\nWR Shaw signs with Redblacks\n\nThe Ottawa Redblacks dipped into free agency to replenish their solid receiving corps.\n\nAccording to a league source, Ottawa signed Kenny Shaw on Tuesday. Shaw, 25, had 77 catches for 1,004 yards and five TDs last season with the Toronto Argonauts.\n\nThe move fills a definite need for Ottawa with 1,000-yard receivers Ernest Jackson and Chris Williams both hitting the open market.\n\nBefore the start of free agency, Ottawa signed Canadian offensive lineman Nolan MacMillan to a one-year contract extension.\n\nBombers extend OL Chungh\n\nThe Winnipeg Blue Bombers signed offensive lineman Sukh Chungh to a contract extension through the 2018 season Tuesday.\n\nChungh was entering the final year of his contract this season.\n\nWinnipeg took Chungh second overall in the 2015 draft. He started 18 games that season and 16 in 2016.\n\nWinnipeg also signed defensive lineman Drake Nevis and Canadian receiver Matt Coates.\n\nDB Phillips moves to Alouettes\n\nRyan Phillips has found a new home with the Montreal Alouettes.\n\nA CFL source said the veteran defensive back signed a one-year deal Tuesday with Montreal. Phillips, 34, was released last week after 12 seasons with the B.C. Lions.\n\nEarlier, Montreal signed Canadians Nicolas Boulay and Kyle Graves to two-year contract extensions. Both were pending free agents.‚Äã\n\nLions sign DB Jackson\n\nThe B.C. Lions were the first team to dip into free agency, signing defensive back Buddy Jackson to a one-year contract Tuesday.\n\nJackson played in six games last season with the Saskatchewan Roughriders, registering 21 tackles.\n\nThe acquisition of Jackson addresses a need for the Lions, who last week released veteran defensive back Ryan Phillips.\n\nB.C. also signed veteran Canadian receiver Marco Iannuzzi, defensive back Ronnie Yell and defensive lineman Mic'hael Brooks to contract extensions. Iannuzzi and Brooks signed deals through the 2018 season while Yell's contract was for 2017.\n\nStamps extend McDaniel, Johnson\n\nThe Calgary Stampeders signed receiver Marquay McDaniel and defensive lineman Micah Johnson to contract extensions Tuesday. Both deals are through the 2018 season.\n\nMcDaniel was Calgary's leading receiver last season with 83 catches for 1,074 yards and four TDs in 16 games. It marked the third time in four years McDaniel had surpassed the 1,000-yard mark.\n\nJohnson started 17 games last year and registered career highs in tackles (36) and sacks (seven).", 
        "The Saskatchewan Roughriders cannot afford to break their fans‚Äô hearts on Valentine‚Äôs Day.\n\nThe contractual courtship of some impactful players must proceed productively when the CFL‚Äôs free-agent period begins Tuesday at 11 a.m.\n\nAfter 2 1/2 years of habitual losing, the Green and White has some holes to fill ‚Äî and some holes to create, if the running game is going to improve.\n\nIt just so happens that Derek Dennis, who was named the league‚Äôs most outstanding offensive lineman in 2016, is poised to test the open market. The mammoth left tackle will not be inexpensive, but no matter. It is imperative that Roughriders football-operations supremo Chris Jones dive into the Dennis derby.\n\nWhat is the alternative? To keep fishing in the hope that somebody, somewhere, can be found to secure the starting quarterback‚Äôs blind side? That is a perilous path, especially when a sure thing (Dennis) should soon be available.\n\nSuppose that the Riders‚Äô starting quarterback is Kevin Glenn, who recently signed for a reported $200,000 (plus incentives) per season. Glenn would then replace Darian Durant ‚Äî now of the Montreal Alouettes ‚Äî who was paid upwards of $400,000 by Saskatchewan last season.\n\nJones also gave himself some cap relief by releasing receiver Shamawd Chambers, whose contract was in the vicinity of $170,000. The Roughriders have paid considerably less (a wage of about $130,000) for a receiver, Duron Carter, who should be infinitely more productive.\n\nSince Jones took over in December of 2015, a stated priority has been to put Saskatchewan in a better salary-cap situation. That being done, there is little point in hoarding the savings.\n\nNow is the time for Jones, et al, to derive significant benefits from cap-conscious decisions that have been made. So, providing that Dennis does not re-sign with the perennially powerful Stampeders before the looming deadline, what reason is there for the Roughriders not too woo him?\n\nNobody in the CFL has a greater need for someone such as Dennis, who does not disguise the fact that money will be a deciding factor. Consider his Twitter posting of Monday morning: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry yall but when‚Äôs last time you could pay bills with Wins? I got family to feed this business never personal.‚Äù\n\nThe Roughriders‚Äô offensive line as a whole warrants attention. The national guards, Brendon LaBatte and Chris Best, are road-graders when healthy ‚Ä¶ the ‚Äúwhen healthy‚Äù part being crucial for two players who are past 30. Best did not play a down last season. LaBatte was concussed for most of the year. It may be a tall order to expect both of them to be 18-game contributors.\n\nWith that in mind, the Roughriders should immerse themselves in a free-agent pool that is expected to include two national offensive linemen who helped the Ottawa Redblacks win the 2016 Grey Cup ‚Äî Nolan MacMillan and J‚ÄôMichael Deane.\n\nThe primary objective must be to improve the front five to the point where there is pass protection and reliable run blocking.\n\nIf the latter mission can be accomplished, the Roughriders could enhance their attack by finding a difference-maker of a running back. Shakir Bell, who was impressive when utilized by the Edmonton Eskimos, is the best free-agent option.\n\nMind you, the Roughriders‚Äô John Murphy should be able to live up to his reputation as player-personnel guru by finding a game-changing ball-carrier, don‚Äôt you think? When it comes to courting free agents, it is more important to find someone who can actually create paths for the featured tailback.\n\nThe line also requires some attention on defence. Saskatchewan clearly needs a defensive tackle of note. One of Michael Brooks (B.C. Lions), Drake Nevis (Hamilton Tiger-Cats) and Alan-Michael Cash (Montreal), all of whom were eligible to test free agency as of this writing, would help to address a glaring void.\n\nOf course, it will take some cash to land Cash or someone of that ilk, but that is how the free-agency game is played.\n\nWith eyes on both sides of the ball, it is time for the Roughriders to put their money on the line.\n\nrvanstone@postmedia.com\n\ntwitter.com/robvanstone",

        "The NBA saw another major deal go down today, when the Toronto Raptors sent wing Terrence Ross and a 2017 first-round pick to the Orlando Magic in exchange for power forward Serge Ibaka. As strong an acquisition as Ibaka is, Ross could wind up benefitting the most from heading to the Sunshine State.\n\nNow, the deal is an absolute winner for Toronto because the team desperately needs help at the power forward position. Rookie Pascal Siakam has averaged just 4.4 points and 3.6 rebounds over 17 minutes per game. Veteran Patrick Patterson has fared slightly better in posting 7.2 points and 5.5 rebounds, but has shot just 38.5% from the field. Jared Sullinger, whom GM Masai Ujiri inked to a one-year, $5.6 million deal last summer, has played in just 11 games and averaged only 10.7 minutes due to slow recovery from a knee injury.\n\nEnter Ibaka, who posted 15.1 points, 6.8 rebounds and 1.6 blocks for the Magic after being acquired from the Oklahoma City Thunder during last year's NBA Draft. He is 27 years old, can be a defensive force and is basically a rental for the Raptors. They will pay what remains of his $12.25 million salary, per Spotrac, and re-signing with the team could be in the cards depending on how he performs in games leading up to and during the postseason.\n\nRoss, on the other hand, is the more interesting player in the deal. A former first-round pick out of Washington, the 26-year-old is perhaps best known for winning the 2013 Slam Dunk Contest in his rookie year. As a player under coach Dwane Casey the past couple of years, he has settled into a role as a bench shooter. Ross is averaging 10.4 points over 22.4 minutes per game this year and is shooting 37.5% from three-point range. That's not at all bad considering his $10 million salary, which is an arguable bargain for a player of his type in a league with a rising salary cap.\n\nRoss can expect more opportunities in Orlando, despite the team currently ranking last in the Southeast Division. Aaron Gordon should shift from the wing to power forward with Ibaka gone and second-year man Mario Hezonja is not ready to be a starter. Ross certainly has the talent to provide some extra scoring from the wing if given extended minutes. His per 36 minutes scoring average is 16.7 points, a great improvement over what has come to be expected of him, and Ross should also help take some of the pressure off of shooting guard and Magic leading scorer Evan Fournier.\n\nThis is exactly why Magic GM Rob Hennigan is the true winner of the trade. He knew Ibaka was of no use to a last place team and instead sent him to a contender willing to pay a high price for his services. In exchange, Orlando now receives a first-round pick on top of the one it already possesses and a player under team control for the next two seasons at a bargain price.
