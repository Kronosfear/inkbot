This is the fourth bid from Paris and 2024 is the centenary of the Games in Paris.\"\n\nThere have been reports the losers of the 2024 bid could be awarded the following Games in 2028.\n\n\"All options are on the table, and this includes also the 2024-2028 procedure and vote,\" said IOC president Thomas Bach last week.\n\nEstanguet, a three-time Olympic canoeing champion, says the bid committee has been in discussions with the IOC since the beginning of the bidding process.\n\nHe added that the bid committee has talked through the issue of 2028 with the IOC on several occasions.\n\nEarlier this week, Eric Garcetti, the mayor of LA, warned the Americans were intent on winning the right to host the 2024 Games.\n\n\"We are competing for 2024,\" he told insidethegames. \"Full stop. We have never contemplated anything else.\"", 
        "body0": "As more players and owners are speaking up with their opinions on the NHL\u2019s involvement in the 2018 Olympics, commissioner Gary Bettman was the latest to comment on the stand-off.\n\nSpeaking to Reuters Tuesday at the Sport Business Summit in New York, Bettman said there were no negotiations currently ongoing between the league, IOC and IIHF and that perhaps people should start thinking about the very real possibility the league stays out of the Pyeongchang Games.\n\n\u201cAs things stand now people should assume we are not going,\u201d Bettman said.\n\nThe NHL has raised a few concerns with going to the 2018 Games, not least of which is that the league has to shut down for two weeks and send its best players to an event they don\u2019t control. Just last week, Senators owner Eugene Melnyk was recalling the 2006 Games when his goalie, Dominik Hasek, went to play for the Czech Republic as Ottawa looked poised to go on a Cup run. Hasek was injured at the Games and never played for the Senators again.\n\nAnother factor is costs. The IOC has backed out of paying insurance and transportation for the players, as it had done in previous Games.\n\n\"I've suggested why don't you treat us like a top sponsor,\" Bettman told Reuters. \"When the IOC comes to us and says, 'by the way we know it cost $15 to $20 million to send your players between insurance, charter costs and accommodations for the players' ... well we're not going to pay for that.\n\n\"If they don't value our participation why are we going?\"\n\nEven if the league does not officially get involved in 2018, there is a possibility some players would ask to leave to represent their countries anyway.\n\nWashington Capitals star Alex Ovechkin has said several times that he'd like to represent Russia next year even if the NHL doesn't go, a stand team owner Ted Leonsis has supported.\n\nMeanwhile, last week Senators defenceman Erik Karlsson said he'd like to go to the Olympics, although Melnyk gave a \"flat no\" to the idea allowing Karlsson to go without NHL participation.\n\nDespite this ongoing dispute, it is believed the NHL still would like to participate in the 2022 Olympics in Beijing to take advantage of the large, mostly untapped Chinese market. Time is running short on a decision to go in 2018, but the league didn't settle on attending the 2014 Games in Sochi until July of 2013.", 
        "body2": "Players across the National Hockey League have been making it clear for awhile that they want to participate in the 2018 Winter Olympics in South Korea.\n\nYou can add Maple Leafs rookie Auston Matthews and Boston Bruins star Brad Marchand to that list.\n\n\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s important,\u201d Matthews said of NHL players taking part.\n\n\n\n\u201cI think everybody likes the idea of the Olympics for sure. I remember always watching them growing up and to play in it would be a huge honour. I\u2019ve represented my country at the NTDP (U.S. national team development program), world championship and world junior and it is always pretty special to put on your country\u2019s jersey.\u201d\n\n\n\nMarchand was asked whether he would be disappointed if it\u2019s determined NHL players won\u2019t be going to South Korea.\n\n\n\n\u201cI think anyone would be,\u201d Marchand said. \u201cFor athletes to get themselves to that level where they can have the opportunity to play in the Olympics, and then for someone to take it away from them, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s really fair, but that is a long ways away.\u201d\n\n\n\nMarchand has represented Canada four times, but not in the Olympic games. He would be a shoo-in to go if the NHL sends its players.\n\n\n\nAnd it would be difficult for the United States to leave Matthews at home.\n\n\n\nLeafs coach Mike Babcock never shies away from telling those who will listen that NHL players should be in the Olympics.\n\n\n\n\u201cI think getting your name on the Stanley Cup is something you dream about, but playing for your country in the Olympics and best on best, there is no better event, there is none,\u201d said Babcock, who has coached Canada to back-to-back Olympic gold medals.\n\n\n\n\u201cTo have that opportunity is important. I think it\u2019s important to showcase your game every year, just not to pick and choose when it is your turn. I think it is important, but I don\u2019t own any (NHL) teams.\u201d\n\n\n\nBRAINY BERGERON\n\n\n\nIf Babcock could take a part of the Bruins\u2019 Patrice Bergeron and give it to his own centres, what would it be?\n\n\n\n\u201cHis head,\u201d Babcock said. \u201cHis drive train. He is smarter than anybody.\n\n\n\n\u201cYou think players are good and then you put them with the best players and some people aren\u2019t as good and other people are better, and Bergy is one of those guys even with the smarter guys and when the game is going faster, he is not an elite skater, his brain is that fast and he just knows how to play and he is competitive.\n\n\n\n\u201cI coached him for the first time when he was 18 at the \u201904 worlds, and he was good right from then, right through. He just wins.\u201d\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s no doubt about that. Bergeron, among the NHL\u2019s elite two-way players in the past decade, has six gold medals from various competitions with Canada as well as the 2011 Stanley Cup championship with the Bruins.\n\n\n\nIn 2004 in Prague, Babcock was behind the bench and Bergeron coming off his rookie season in the NHL when Canada won gold at the world championship. Babcock also has coached Bergeron in the Olympics.\n\n\n\nLOOSE LEAFS\n\n\n\nBruins legend Bobby Orr turned 69 on Monday and several members of the team offered best wishes. \u201cHappy birthday to Bobby,\u201d Marchand said. \u201cGreat age, great year. He is a tremendous icon in this game and he has been able to basically change the way defencemen play that position and he\u2019s an incredible human being. The nicest guy you will ever meet.\u201d \u2026 Marchand and Pittsburgh Penguins superstar Sidney Crosby were excellent together at the World Cup in September, playing a large role in Canada\u2019s gold-medal win. That was then, this is now, and apparently the NHL rivalry between the teams is what rules. Marchand answered with a terse \u201cno\u201d when he was asked if he and Crosby text each other every so often \u2026 The Toronto Marlies will not have forward Kerby Rychel for their game on Tuesday night in Rochester. Rychel received an automatic one-game suspension from the American Hockey League after he was assessed an instigator penalty during the final five minutes of the Marlies\u2019 8-4 loss against Binghamton on Saturday.",

        "body1": "[Need game previews this week! -yfbb]\n\nStart Time: 6 p.m. CT\n\nWhere: Air Canada Centre, Toronto\n\nTV: ESPN, CSN Chicago\n\nInjury Report\n\nBulls: Dwyane Wade (Elbow), Cameron Payne (Foot/D-League/Bad)\n\nRaptors: Kyle Lowry (Wrist)\n\nProjected Starting Lineups\n\nBulls: Rajon Rondo, Jimmy Butler, Paul Zipser, Nikola Mirotic, Robin Lopez\n\nRaptors: Cory Joseph, DeMar DeRozan, DeMarre Carroll, Serge Ibaka, Jonas Valanciunas\n\nPreview\n\nThe Bulls (33-37) are trash, but Tuesday night they\u2019re playing the Tortrashto Trashtors (41-29), so maybe Chicago won\u2019t actually be trash in this one.\n\nYes, the Bulls have inexplicably won 11 games in a row against the team north of the border, one of several utterly ridiculous streaks this silly team owns (hi, #TNTBulls). The Bulls won both prior meetings this season at the United Center, with one featuring a huge second-half Trashtors collapse and the other just a general whoopin\u2019 right before the All-Star break in a game that didn\u2019t include Dwyane Wade, Nikola Mirotic, Paul Zipser for Chicago (Patrick Patterson was also out).\n\nThe last time the Bulls played up in Canada was last March, when Trashtors killer Doug McDermott was at his Dino-killing finest with 29 points on 9-of-11 shooting. The Bulls won\u2019t have their infamous Trashtors slayer since he\u2019s now plying his craft in OKC (and still showing why he\u2019s no good), but I\u2019m sure some other random Bull will pick up the slack and drop 25 points out of nowhere. I would\u2019ve taken Bobby Portis, but two huge games in a row may be a bit too much for him.\n\nSo this will probably be the day Michael Carter-Williams or Paul Zipser (or both?) shoot 10-of-12 from the field to help keep the Bulls\u2019 playoff hopes alive. The Bulls are 10th in the East, one game behind the Pistons (No. 8) and Heat (No. 9). It\u2019s a pretty miserable existence, really, a thought echoed by Fred Hoiberg. We agree on something!\n\nThe Trashtors have kind of been meandering along for months since their red-hot start, although they\u2019re 8-5 coming out of the break without Kyle Lowry and have improved on defense with the additions of Serge Ibaka and P.J. Tucker. They were a middling 16th in defensive rating pre-All-Star break, but they\u2019re fourth post-ASB. So while the loss of Lowry has hurt their once-historic offense, the defensive bump has helped mitigate that and they sit just a game behind the Wizards for the No. 3 seed.\n\nSo, this game is important for both teams when it comes to playoff positioning. It\u2019s also a game the Trashtors SHOULD win given they\u2019re the better team (even without Lowry) and at home against a Bulls squad that sucks on the road, but basically nothing in this series lately has made much sense. A Bulls win wouldn\u2019t be surprising in the slightest, and while Bulls wins kind of annoy me at this point, it\u2019s always fun to clown the Trashtors.\n\nGo Bulls?", 
        "body0": "Rachel Nichols reflects on the legacy of former Bulls general manager Jerry Krause, who died Tuesday at the age of 77. (0:54)\n\nJerry Krause, the architect of the Chicago Bulls dynasty of the 1990s, has died at age 77.\n\nThe Bulls confirmed his death on Tuesday.\n\nA Chicago native, Krause was both revered and reviled in his hometown.\n\nAfter taking over as Bulls general manager in 1985, Krause was responsible for bringing together the pieces around Michael Jordan that led to six championships.\n\nEditor's Picks ESPN 1000 AUDIO: Paxson calls draft deal for Pippen 'Krause's best move' Bulls VP of Basketball Ops John Paxson tells Waddle & Silvy that although former GM Jerry Krause was an easy target, his resume matches up with the best executives in the game.\n\nHe hired Phil Jackson from the Continental Basketball Association as an assistant to coach Doug Collins and eventually fired Collins in favor of the unconventional Jackson. The move raised questions because Collins had led the Bulls to the Eastern Conference finals in 1988-89, losing to the eventual champion Detroit Pistons.\n\nJackson's maneuvering of superstar personalities, though, was later seen as a big part of the Bulls' sustained success.\n\nBesides getting Jackson, Krause worked a 1987 draft-day trade to get Scottie Pippen out of obscure Central Arkansas and drafted Horace Grant. The Grant selection made it possible to trade popular power forward Charles Oakley to the New York Knicks for center Bill Cartwright in 1988. With Jordan, those players formed the core of the first three Bulls titles in 1991-93.\n\nJerry Krause, left, speaks with then Bulls coach Phil Jackson in 1995. AP Photo/Mike Fisher\n\nAfter Jordan briefly retired in 1993 and then returned in 1995, the Bulls had more work to do. Krause signed guard Ron Harper and acquired Dennis Rodman to replace Grant, who had bolted in free agency. Krause had also drafted Toni Kukoc out of Croatia in 1990, before it was popular to select players from overseas. Kukoc became a key part of the second three-peat.\n\nAfter three more titles from 1996 to 1998, however, the wheels came off. A simmering feud with Jackson led to the coach leaving. Pippen was traded to the Houston Rockets, and Jordan retired for the second time in 1999.\n\nDespite being named NBA Executive of the Year twice, Krause was often blamed for the disintegration of the dynasty that he had been such a big part of building.\n\nTim Floyd became the new coach, and the Bulls drafted Elton Brand No. 1 in 1999, but Chicago never won more than 30 games in a season before Krause retired from the Bulls in 2003. Despite the dramatic fall-off, during Krause's 18 seasons as Chicago's GM, the Bulls won more games (808) than any other Eastern Conference team, according to ESPN Stats & Information.\n\nIn a statement to the Chicago Tribune, Michael Jordan said: \"Jerry was a key figure in the Bulls' dynasty and meant so much to the Bulls, White Sox and City of Chicago.\" He added: \"My heartfelt condolences go out to his wife, Thelma, his family and friends.\"\n\nJackson also weighed in.\n\n\"The news of Jerry Krause's death is a sad day for the Chicago Bulls and the entire NBA community,\" he said. \"He was a man determined to create a winning team in Chicago -- his hometown. Jerry was known as \"The Sleuth\" for his secrecy, but it was no secret that he built the dynasty in Chicago. We, who were part of his vision in that run, remember him today.\"\n\nBefore getting the Bulls GM job, Krause was an NBA scout for numerous teams and then a baseball scout for the Chicago White Sox, whose owner, Jerry Reinsdorf, also owned the Bulls.\n\n\"The entire Bulls organization is deeply saddened by the passing of Jerry Krause,\" Reinsdorf said in a statement. \"Jerry was one of the hardest working guys I have ever been around, and he was one of the best talent evaluators ever. Jerry played an integral role in our run of six championships in eight years. He truly was the architect of all our great teams in the '90s. I would not have been elected to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame if it were not for Jerry. We will miss him tremendously, and we send our thoughts and prayers to his wife Thelma and the Krause family.\"\n\nIn recent years, Krause had returned to baseball scouting, working for the Yankees, Mets and White Sox again. He was was named a special assistant to the scouting department of the Diamondbacks in 2011.\n\nKrause was a finalist this year for induction in the basketball Hall of Fame as a contributor.\n\nBulls executive vice president John Paxson, who played for the Bulls from 1985 to 1994, says it's unfortunate Krause didn't make the Hall in his lifetime.\n\n\"Jerry was a hard worker; he was a grinder,\" Paxson said Tuesday on ESPN 1000's Waddle and Silvy Show. \"He loved getting down in the mud and evaluating talent. He deserves -- it's one of those things. I think at the Hall of Fame this past year when Jerry Reinsdorf was enshrined he said it. [Reinsdorf] was there because of the teams that Jerry Krause put together. And it's a shame -- I'm confident some day Jerry Krause will be in the Hall of Fame, but it's one of those sad things now where it won't be while he's still with us and can be acknowledged for what he did accomplish.\"\n\nAccording to the Chicago Tribune, a memorial service for Krause will be held April 9.", 
        "body2": "It's not much to work with, but humorously or not, Jimmy Butler at least took a stab at guessing why the Bulls have won 11 straight games over the Raptors.\n\n\"I think we just catch them on off nights,\" Butler said.\n\nWhere Butler is stone-cold serious is the focus the Bulls need to win a critical game Tuesday night, even if the Raptors remain without All-Star guard Kyle Lowry.\n\n\"KLow is a really, really good player and does so many things well. But they got other good players as well,\" Butler said.\n\n\"Yeah, he\u2019s missed and we should try to capitalize on that. But they\u2019re playing extremely well in his absence. Don\u2019t overlook Cory (Joseph) or any of those other guys.\"\n\nThree of those other guys are new to the matchup. The Raptors added Serge Ibaka and P.J. Tucker at the trade deadline, and Patrick Patterson missed the Bulls' first two victories this season to injury.\n\nCoach Fred Hoiberg said the Bulls will start Rajon Rondo, Butler, Paul Zipser, Nikola Mirotic and Robin Lopez. The Bulls are a game out of the playoffs in 10th place with 12 to play.",

Units have lost about 2.7% in that time frame, underperforming the market.\n\nWill the recent negative trend continue leading up to the stock's next earnings release, or is it due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.\n\nFourth-Quarter 2016 Report\n\nEnbridge Energy Partners reported fourth-quarter 2016 adjusted earnings of $0.14 per unit, which came in above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.13. The bottom line also improved from the year-earlier level of $0.11.

The upside was driven by higher revenues due to increased Lakehead system deliveries owing to new assets placed into service as well as lower operating and administrative expenses. This was partially offset by the rise in depreciation expenses over the prior-year comparable period due to new assets placed into service.\n\nNatural Gas: The Natural Gas unit reported adjusted loss of $3.7 million that compared unfavorably with an operating income of $5.0 million in the year-ago quarter. The deterioration mainly stemmed from lower natural gas and NGL system production volumes. Reduced system volumes were primarily attributable to the still low commodity price environment for hydrocarbons.

She was 94.\n\nShe was born Elizabeth Annette Leete on Nov. 16, 1921, to Gladys Johnson (Leete) and Ben Ford Leete in Los Angeles, California. She and siblings Gene Leete and Yvonne Leete (Metzler) grew up in Bishop, California, where her family managed a well known hot springs health resort.\n\nBetty returned to Los Angeles where she worked for Hughes Aircraft Company during World War II. She met and married William Edward \"Ted\" Kennedy in the early 1940s (Ted passed away July 3, 1998). Together they had one daughter, Marianne L. Kennedy (Keehn), born in June 1947.\n\nIn later years, Betty and Ted moved to Lake Wildwood, California, where she worked as a bookkeeper for Nevada Irrigation District in Grass Valley. Betty was actively involved with 4-H through her daughter, and the Order of the Eastern Star until her late retirement to Watsonville, California. She was an exceptionally skilled quilter and handcrafter, having won numerous awards and made precious home goods for all those around her.\n\nBetty Kennedy is most dearly remembered by family, friends and neighbors as a patient, caring and sacrificing mother, wife, daughter, sister and friend. Her life is celebrated daily in the warmest memories of everyone she leaves behind.\n\nBetty is survived by her daughter, Marianne Keehn; grandson William (Joanne) Keehn; granddaughter Brandy A. (Matthew) Hackwell; two great-granddaughters, Brittany and Allyson Hackwell; sister Yvonne Metzler and two nieces and two nephews.\n\nFamily and friends from across the state and country will gather, per Betty's wishes, for her interment alongside husband Ted at 11 a.m., on March 27, 2017 at the Penn Valley cemetery.

        "body0": "Journalist and television personality Betty Kennedy, famed for her work on CBC's long-running current affairs quiz show Front Page Challenge, has died at 91.\n\nKennedy, who was born and raised in Ottawa, died on Monday, according to a statement from her family.\n\nKennedy's interviewing ease charmed audiences but she said her career in broadcasting actually came about by fluke. She got her start at the Ottawa Citizen, working on the newspaper. When the paper's staff went on strike, she was asked to host a radio show in an effort to keep subscribers from fleeing.\n\nBetty Kennedy, reporter and panellist11:49\n\nCFRB, the talk radio station in Toronto, took notice and she soon made the jump to the city to host her own program: The Betty Kennedy Show. That's where she developed her signature interviewing style \u2014 posing a question and just letting her interview subjects talk. And they liked it.\n\nDuring an interview on the show with American architect Buckminster Fuller, he told Kennedy: \"I don't think I recall a conversation where anybody has been quite as logically sensitive as you are about these questions you ask.\"\n\nBob Rae, former Liberal leader and Ontario premier, told CBC News Tuesday that Kennedy prepared meticulously for her interviews, calling her an \"icon of Canadian journalism.\"\n\n\"She was always extremely polite and thoughtful. And she had a huge listenership and anybody in politics or public life at that time, that's the show you wanted to be on.\"\n\nKennedy hosted her own show at Toronto's CFRB for 27 years. She interviewed politicians, community leaders and celebrities, like Leonard Nimoy. (City of Toronto Archives)\n\nIn the show's 27 years, Kennedy got to talk to 25,000 guests, from celebrities and politicians to community builders.\n\nShe recalled her beginnings in a 1965 TV interview with CBC's Elwood Glover. \"It's very much a sink or swim business. If you're lucky enough to get in, you're really on your own.\" He commended her on her interviewing style and the questions she chose to ask. Kennedy compared it to everyday life.\n\n\"Your own mind and your own curiosity is often the best guide, I think, on what you ask. If you're curious about something, chances are somebody else is too,\" Kennedy responded.\n\n'She has class'\n\nBut it was her appearances as a panellist on CBC-TV's Front Page Challenge that's she's perhaps best known for. She started with the show in 1962 and lasted until its cancellation in 1995. The show saw panellists try to guess a mystery guest who they would then interview.\n\nThere she was paired with famed journalists like Pierre Berton and Gordon Sinclair, something she found intimidating at first. She said she was \"scared to death\" to start, but soon found that both men weren't that \"frightening at all.\"\n\nGordon Sinclair (left), Betty Kennedy (second from left), guest panellist Lister Sinclair (second from right) and Pierre Berton, along with mystery guest Charlotte Whitton (top) take part in an episode of CBC's Front Page Challenge in November 1963. (CBC Still Image Collection)\n\nThe show's one-time producer Don Brown once said she was a perfect fit: \"She has class. She's a very experienced journalist. She brought dignity, a femininity, a cool, controlled intelligence.\"\n\nHer work earned her spots in both the Canadian Broadcasting Hall of Fame and the Canadian News Hall of Fame and in 1982, she was made an Officer of the Order of Canada.\n\nIn her post-broadcast life, she sat on many different councils and committees and enjoyed being outdoors \u2014 swimming, bird watching and fishing with the Ristigouche Salmon Club in Quebec.\n\nPart of the team from Front Page Challenge \u2014 Gordon Sinclair, Betty Kennedy and Fred Davis \u2014 visit the Sun Salmon Derby in August 1966. (Franz Lindner/CBC)\n\nShe was a longtime Liberal supporter; former prime minister Jean Chretien appointed her to the Senate in 2000, at age 74. Since the mandatory retirement age is 75, she spent less then a year there. Chretien defended her older age appointment at the time, telling reporters she brought lots of experience to the job.\n\nOn Tuesday, he remembered Kennedy, telling CBC News she was often \"first at everything.\"\n\n\"She was a very elegant and sophisticated person and she was well known across the land and liked by everybody,\" he said. \"She was a real great personality.\"",

Led by Kennedy Center Artistic Director for Jazz Jason Moran, the Jazz Ahead program identifies outstanding, emerging jazz artists/composers in their mid-teens to age 25 and brings them together under the tutelage of experienced artists/instructors who coach and counsel them, polishing their performance, composing, and arranging skills.\n\nA total of 23 highly talented young musicians from the United States, Austria, Germany, Japan, Australia, Costa Rica, Ukraine, and the Bahamas were selected by a competitive audition process that considered their composition and performance abilities. Joining Moran to lead the residency are seven renowned jazz artists who were mentored by BetTy Carter: trumpeter Darren Barrett, pianist Xavier Davis, vocalist Carmen Lundy, drummer Ralph Peterson, bassist ReuBen Rogers, saxophonist Mark Shim, and guitarist Mark Whitfield. The 2017 BCJA program culminates in three concerts on the Kennedy Center Millennium Stage, March 29-31, 2017 at 6 p.m., in which the graduates will perform original compositions. The free performances are open to the general public, and will also be broadcast live on the Kennedy Center website and archived for subsequent access.\n\nBetTy Carter founded Jazz Ahead as a vehicle to foster the musical talents of future generations of jazz talent. Sheoriginally developed the program in 1993 at 651, an arts center in Brooklyn. In 1997, the late Dr. Billy Taylor (Kennedy Center Artistic Director for Jazz, 1994-2010) invited Carter to bring Jazz Ahead to Washington, D.C. In April 1998, the inaugural class of Kennedy Center Jazz Ahead students presented an unforgettable concert with Carter herself joining them on the Kennedy Center Concert Hall stage. Jason Moran, then a young pianist from Houston, was selected by Carter to be a student in this first year at Kennedy Center. BetTy Carter's Jazz Ahead had a new home and Carter was filled with hope for the future of the program. After Carter's untimely death in September 1998, the Carter family graciously granted the Kennedy Center the opportunity to continue her legacy by making the program an annual Kennedy Center event. Distinguished alumni from BetTy Carter's Jazz Ahead include pianists Jason Moran and Aaron Parks; guitarist Lage Lund; trombonist Andre Hayward; bassist Ameen Saleem; violinist Miri Ben-Ari; vocalists Daniela Schaechter, Grace Kelly, and Jazzmeia Horn; saxophonists Marcus Strickland and Jon Irabagon; and drummer Jamison Ross, among others.\n\nBetTy Carter's Jazz Ahead 2017 Participants\n\nNAME INSTRUMENT HOMETOWN Noel Mason Bass Australia Kenneth Jimenez Bass Costa Rica Emiliano Lasansky Upright Bass Iowa City, IA Daniel Giannone Drums Wayne, NJ Carlos Moreno Druma Portland, OR Misaki Nakamichi Drums Japan Will Rachofsky Guitar New York, NY Django Martin-Rowe Guitar Australia William Kjeer Piano Saint Paul, MN Bijan Taghavi Piano New York, NY Matthew Whitaker Piano Hackensack, NJ Nathan Hook Saxophone Philadelphia, PA Markus Howell Saxophone Deerfield Beach, FL DeAndre Lettsome Saxophone Jacksonville, FL Daniel Dickinson Saxophone New York, NY CaleB Smith Trombone Shaker Heights, OH Abdulrahman Amer Trombone New York, NY Yakiv Tsvietinskyi Trumpet Ukraine Giveton Gelin Trumpet Bahamas Florian Klinger Vibraphone Austria Mia Knop Jacobsen Voice Germany Chloe Brisson Voice Hanover, NH Ayodele Owolabi Voice Buford, GA\n\nABOUT KENNEDY CENTER JAZZ\n\nKennedy Center Jazz, under the leadership of Artistic Director Jason Moran, presents legendary artists who have helped shape the art form, artists who are emerging on the jazz scene, and innovative multidisciplinary projects in hundreds of performances a year.

And then I think it caused a number of clubs to say, \u2018Well, wait a minute, if that\u2019s how they value our participation, why are we knocking ourselves out?\u2019\u201d\n\nToday, Bettman re-iterated Olympic participation was terribly disruptive for NHL business, adding \u201cwe have been unable to quantify any benefit from it.\u201d\n\nFor more from Reuters, including info on which sponsors are trying to help broker a deal, click here.\n\nMeanwhile, here\u2019s what NHL deputy commissioner Bill Daly had to say on the matter:\n\nBill Daly on if the NHL goes to Olympics: 'As of today, the decision would be \"no\".

Mandatory Credit: Kim Klement-USA TODAY Sports\n\nAccording to a report from the Toronto Sun, John Gibbons is expected to sign a contract extension with the Toronto Blue Jays before opening day.\n\nOne of John Gibbons\u2018 most valuable assets, is his (most of the time) laid-back, easy-going personality. It is this demeanor, which allows him to deal with all the egos that populate the Toronto Blue Jays roster.\n\nAs such, it comes as no surprise Gibbons told the front office to put his contract situation to the back of the line, after the conclusion of last season. He was well aware general manager Ross Atkins and company had extensive work to do, in respect of putting together a team for 2017.\n\nHowever, good things come to those who wait, and the Great Falls, Montana native should have a new deal in place soon enough. In fact, as per the Toronto Sun\u2018s Rob Longley, a contract extension will more than likely be agreed prior to opening day.\n\nThe main question relates to how long the new deal will be for? Gibbons\u2019 current contract is due to expire at the end of the upcoming season.\n\nYou imagine the 54-year old would like any new contract to be for more than just one additional year. Fortunately for him, it sounds like Atkins has a similar mindset, as he told Longley and other members of the media:\n\n\u201cJohn and I have worked well together over the (last) year and we both feel very fortunate to have established trust and respect. When you come into a new situation not having those established lines of communication, then going through a year we feel that not only was a successful one but a very productive one for the two of us (is a positive). So looking forward, we\u2019re talking about the Blue Jays organization and not just the two of us leading it, but the two of us being a part of leading it together.\u201d\n\nThat we are now in this situation tells you how well Gibbons has done since returning for his second tenure as Blue Jays\u2019 manager in 2013. At the time of his re-hiring, it was met with a certain degree of apathy.\n\nWhen the former catcher went on to produce a 74-88 record during his first season back in charge, there were calls for him to be replaced. Fortunately for everyone concerned, this didn\u2019t happen and the organization has benefited immensely.\n\nGibbons has gone on to record a winning record in each of his three seasons since, while also ending the Blue Jays\u2019 21-year postseason drought. Further, he has taken the team to within striking distance of the World Series, with two consecutive ALCS appearances.\n\nFor another indication of how successful the 1980 first round draft pick has been in Toronto, consider his overall wins total. Entering the 2017 season, his mark of 644 wins is only topped by a certain Cito Gaston, who recorded 894 regular season victories.\n\nWhether Gibbons eventually surpasses this total is open to debate. However, this is little denying he deserves his contract extension, as he attempts to join Gaston as a World Series-winning manager with the Blue Jays.\n\nWhat\u2019s your overall take on the job Gibbons has done, since returning as Blue Jays manager? Are you happy he is set to sign a contract extension, or would you prefer the team go in a different direction? Share your thoughts in the comments section below.",

        "body2": "Introduction\n\nThank you for the invitation to speak here today. My colleagues and I routinely consult the business community, and I welcome the opportunity to share our economic outlook with you and listen to your views. This consultation process is an important ingredient in our policy making.\n\nTo achieve our monetary policy goal of low, stable and predictable inflation at the 2 per cent target rate, our economy should operate at, or close to, its productive capacity. However, most advanced economies, including ours, have been running well below full capacity since the Great Recession of 2008\u201309 owing to a persistent deficiency in demand.\n\nAfter years of serial disappointment, recent data suggest that the recovery in the global economy appears to be gaining traction. Notably, growth in the US economy is expected to remain solid, supported by robust fundamentals, including a strong labour market with gradually rising wages.\n\nFor the Canadian economy, estimates of the growth of gross domestic product (GDP) from Statistics Canada for the fourth quarter of 2016 came in somewhat stronger than we had anticipated in our January Monetary Policy Report (MPR). While the headline number is welcome news, a more detailed analysis suggests continued scope for caution. Exports continue to face ongoing competitiveness challenges. And despite recent gains in employment, subdued growth in wages and hours worked continues to reflect persistent economic slack in Canada, in contrast to the United States.\n\nIn particular, one component of GDP that remains concerning is business investment. While investment in the energy sector now appears to be stabilizing after a painful adjustment to the decline in oil and other commodity prices that began in 2014, overall business investment in the economy remains weak. Statistics Canada also reported that non-residential business investment spending contracted by more than 15 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2016 and by almost 8 per cent for the year as a whole.\n\nThe current elevated level of geopolitical uncertainty, and the related prevailing uncertainties around the economic outlook, are likely contributing importantly to this continued underperformance in business investment. Therefore, it is still too early to assume that the worst is behind us.\n\nSo business investment is the topic I want to focus on today. It is, I am sure, top of mind for many of you, given the strength of business activity here in British Columbia. It is also top of mind for the Bank of Canada. Obtaining an up-to-date and better understanding of the investment intentions of the business community is critical for our outlooks for economic activity and inflation, which inform our monetary policy decisions.\n\nAlthough business investment represents a relatively small share of GDP\u2014about 12 per cent, on average\u2014it is a key economic indicator that we track closely for three main reasons. First, it reflects your expectations about the future. Therefore, it is an economic bellwether\u2014you will invest only when you are relatively certain that the demand for your goods and services will remain firm or increase. Second, fluctuations in business investment can drive the business cycle\u2014roughly 50 per cent of the movements in quarterly GDP during the Great Recession and its aftermath were due to shifts in business investment. And third, investment adds to our stock of capital and increases the level of \u201cpotential output\u201d or productive capacity\u2014the level of output our economy can produce sustainably without generating inflationary or disinflationary pressures.\n\nMy talk consists of three main sections. I\u2019ll start with an overview of the cyclical and structural forces affecting investment. Then I\u2019ll review the impacts of these forces on investment in Canada since the 2008\u201309 recession, especially the period since mid-2014. Finally, I\u2019ll discuss our base-case or most likely outlook for investment and the economy and our assessment of the risks to inflation.\n\nInvestment: Cyclical and Structural Forces\n\nCyclical forces\n\nAs I mentioned, business investment is a small and relatively volatile component of GDP, and investment across business sectors tends to crest and trough like the tides in response to shocks to demand. This ebb and flow reflects two related factors. First, investment projects are often large, require irreversible sunk costs, and take time to build and operate. Undertaking them depends on expectations of future demand. Second, the expectations of individual firms are often influenced by the behaviour of other firms and perceptions of overall business confidence. Consequently, common movements in expectations can become self-fulfilling. If many firms invest together, they will collectively boost demand for their products. The famous British economist John Maynard Keynes called these shared psychological forces \u201canimal spirits,\u201d which he described as the \u201cspontaneous urge to action rather than inaction.\u201d\n\nWhen these spirits are aroused and businesses start to see demand strengthening, economic momentum accelerates. As sales improve and profits rise, businesses become more confident. As a result, they invest in machinery, equipment and buildings to expand capacity. Investment expenditures raise employment, household income and spending, which, in turn, boost demand and further stimulate businesses to invest.\n\nThe other factor that promotes the cyclical flows in investment spending is depreciation. Over time, capital assets depreciate or become obsolete and need to be replaced. During periods of weak or uncertain demand, firms typically delay their reinvestment decisions. However, they can do so for only so long. Thus, when it appears that the economic tide is turning, firms will take the opportunity to reinvest, and their collective actions will amplify the economic upswing.\n\nIn practice, these psychological and economic forces often work in tandem and are self-reinforcing.\n\nStructural forces\n\nFor the structural forces, or long-term determinants of the demand for capital and investment, it is useful to think about a typical firm\u2019s production process. Firms combine labour, capital and technology to produce goods and services. Therefore, demographic forces that affect the growth of the labour force will also affect the demand for capital. For example, faster labour force growth will encourage firms to invest not only to meet greater demand but also to equip these additional workers with machines and other capital to raise their productivity. The rate of technological progress is also a key factor, since a faster pace of innovation raises the return on each additional unit of capital, stimulating firms to invest more. Indeed, fresh investment often embodies new technology and serves to further increase productivity.\n\nThe composition of investment matters too. The nature of the production process determines the amount and type of capital (and investment) required. Services, for example, generally require less investment than oil sands or motor vehicle production. Thus, the ongoing expansion of the service sector means we may see a shift from traditional forms of investment in structures, such as factories and heavy machinery, toward investment in intellectual property, such as software and research and development, as well as in human capital.\n\nAnd public investment can complement and thereby enhance the productivity of private investment. High-quality infrastructure in the form of transportation systems, power-generation facilities and, more recently, telecommunication networks (some of which may be provided privately) are essential to modern production processes, especially given the accelerating digital transformation of the global economy.\n\nBusiness Investment Since the Great Recession\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, business investment collapsed during the Great Recession, and its much-weaker-than-expected recovery since, despite historically low financing rates, has been a major source of disappointment in advanced economies.\n\nThe challenge for policy-makers, including us at the Bank, is to assess how much of the weakness in business investment reflects the dynamics of the business cycle and how much is due to structural forces. This distinction is important for our projections for demand and for potential output or supply, which are critical to our monetary policy decision.\n\nFocusing on Canada, let\u2019s consider the possible impacts of cyclical and structural forces on investment over this period.\n\nTwo key cyclical factors have affected business investment in Canada since the Great Recession: sharp movements in commodity prices and the subdued pace of the US recovery.\n\nAlthough the collapse in investment was as acute in Canada as it was in other advanced economies, Canadian business investment bounced back relatively quickly, as the oil and gas sector benefited from a sizable rebound in commodity prices (Chart 1). Nowhere was this more apparent than in investments in non-residential structures, which by the end of 2010 had already surpassed their pre-crisis peak (Chart 2). Moreover, this had positive spillovers for investment in industries with strong connections to the commodity sector, even though we were continuing to see many firms in other industries closing their doors.\n\nBy the middle of 2014, the level of Canadian investment had grown to 15 per cent above its pre-crisis peak. Then the oil price shock hit. Prices plummeted from above US$100 a barrel in the first half of 2014 to around US$35 a barrel by the end of 2015. This set off a complex set of adjustments to the Canadian economy, including a significant depreciation of the Canadian dollar, that are still at play today.\n\nThe Bank estimates that over the past two years the level of investment in the oil and gas sector alone has declined by almost 50 per cent (Chart 3). In turn, sectors linked to the oil and gas industry curtailed their investment decisions. Consequently, investment in Canada has declined by more than 20 per cent since the middle of 2014.\n\nThe second cyclical factor that has had a major impact on our exports and business investment is the protracted recovery of the US economy\u2014the slowest in the postwar period. When oil and other commodity prices rose in the years before the 2014 oil price shock, so did our dollar, making our non-commodity exports to the United States less competitive and reinforcing the ongoing shift from manufacturing to services. As I mentioned earlier, this is likely reducing the level of investment.\n\nNow, let\u2019s look at the structural factors that affected business investment during this period. I\u2019ll focus on two: demographics and productivity growth.\n\nPopulation aging under way across most advanced economies has led to a marked slowdown in labour force growth, and this has been a strong headwind to investment. In Canada and the United States, for example, the annual growth rate of the labour force slowed from around 1 1/4 per cent in 2006 to less than 1/2 per cent in 2016. This decline has reduced potential output growth and investment demand.\n\nLow productivity growth since 2007 has also been a headwind on business investment. However, while demographic shifts are fairly predictable, it is less clear how much of the decline in productivity growth reflects a structural change and how much is a cyclical response to the subdued recovery. For example, the loss of existing firms and the low creation rate of new firms during and after the Great Recession have not only directly reduced investment but also impaired the dynamism of the private sector, causing persistent, adverse effects on productivity growth.\n\nAll of these challenges have increased uncertainty about the strength of future demand and weighed on business confidence. As a result, Canadian firms have acted cautiously in their investment decisions, despite operating close to capacity in some industries. In some cases, they have met any increases in demand by hiring more labour.\n\nSo that\u2019s how we got to where we are. Let me now take you through our most recent economic outlook for Canada.\n\nThe Outlook for the Economy and Investment\n\nLet me start by making two important points from our January Monetary Policy Report and March 1st policy rate announcement.\n\nFirst, our outlook since mid-2016 for gradually increasing global growth is largely consistent with what we have seen in the data.\n\nSecond, heightened concerns about prospective protectionist measures mean that we should not presume that the economic disappointments we have experienced since the Great Recession are over.\n\nThat said, the adjustment to the decline in commodity prices is progressing, and activity in resource-related industries appears to have bottomed out.\n\nReal GDP growth is expected to pick up from 1.4 per cent in 2016 to slightly above 2.0 per cent in 2017 and 2018, with the expansion of the service sector underpinning rising employment, household incomes and consumption.\n\nThe strengthening US and global economies and the federal fiscal stimulus in Canada are also expected to support exports and domestic demand. Financial conditions remain accommodative for investment, despite a modest increase in longer-term borrowing costs since October.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, investment is expected to slowly strengthen. Recent data on oil rig activity and the capital expenditure plans of oil and gas firms suggest that investment in the sector has begun to increase this year. Meanwhile, the growth of the service sector and a modest expansion in exports should continue to support moderate investment growth in other sectors in 2017 and 2018.\n\nInflation is projected to be near 2 per cent through 2017 and 2018 as the temporary effects of higher consumer energy prices and lower food prices dissipate and economic slack is absorbed.\n\nRisks to Inflation\n\nThe outlook for inflation is subject to a number of risks that the Bank identifies as important. Let\u2019s start with two risks that could raise inflationary pressures and that are particularly significant for investment.\n\nStronger GDP growth in the United States\n\nThe ongoing US recovery, the new US administration\u2019s decision to restart the approval process for the Keystone XL pipeline and other energy projects, and further policy measures, including tax reform, deregulation and infrastructure spending, could boost both demand and business confidence, igniting animal spirits and leading to an acceleration in the rates of investment, firm creation and innovation. Stronger US household spending and public and private investment would have positive spillovers for Canadian exports and investment.\n\nHigher commodity prices\n\nRecently the prices of non-energy commodities have drifted higher, rising by roughly 2.7 per cent since we published our January Monetary Policy Report. If they were to continue to strengthen, this would improve Canada\u2019s terms of trade, wealth, and hence household spending and business investment.\n\nNow, let\u2019s look at two risks that could exert downward pressure on inflation.\n\nA shift toward protectionist trade policies\n\nThe new US administration and some political leaders in other jurisdictions have espoused policies that are inward looking, although precise measures remain to be determined. Such protectionist policies would dampen global trade and economic growth and either directly or indirectly reduce Canadian exports and business investment. They could also restrain or reverse the ongoing process of global economic integration, most notably the development of global value chains, which has supported growth in recent decades.\n\nSluggish business investment in Canada\n\nThe disappointing performance of business investment to date could reflect more sustained structural factors, such as slowing labour force growth, low productivity growth and regulatory obstacles. Over time, weaker investment growth would reduce capital deepening and lower poten\u00adtial output growth.\n\nConclusion\n\nLet me wrap up with three points.\n\nFirst, the decline in oil and other commodity prices since mid-2014 has dramatically altered the paths of business investment in Canada and the United States. The two countries are now at different points in their respective business cycles (Chart 4 and Chart 5). Although the Canadian economy has made good progress adjusting to the oil price shock, material slack in our economy remains, in contrast to the US economy, which is approaching its productive capacity. In our March statement we indicated that our current monetary policy stance remained appropriate to achieve our 2 per cent inflation target on a sustainable basis by around the middle of 2018, whereas US authorities have now begun to tighten. Our economic projection will be updated in the April Monetary Policy Report, and we will review the stance of monetary policy at that time.\n\nSecond, recent economic data are largely consistent with our outlook of a gradual strengthening in global economic growth. However, uncertainty remains elevated because of prospective policies that put at risk the progress made in recent decades to liberalize trade and foster economic integration.\n\nCanada, however, has resisted this protectionist tilt. We have just concluded a major free trade agreement with the European Union and are working toward lowering barriers to internal trade. We view these measures, as well as the recent changes to immigration policy, as positive steps that will increase growth over the medium-to-long term.\n\nThird, and finally, I am sure many of you are considering whether this is the right time to invest and build your business. Such decisions are never easy, but at the Bank of Canada, we are committed to reducing the uncertainty you face and helping you make the best possible investment decisions by achieving our monetary policy goal of low, stable and predictable inflation.\n\nI would like to thank Russell Barnett for his help in preparing this speech.",
