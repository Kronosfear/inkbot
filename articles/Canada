Toronto and Atlantic Canada will also be key areas for growth, he added.\n\n\"As a Quebecer who grew up in Rimouski, who lived in Ottawa, Montreal, Toronto in the past, I am well-placed to actually be able do that work that will be needed to ensure that the NDP will regain its strength coast-to-coast.\"\n\nThe race to replace Mulcair, which got off to the slowest of starts, has been gaining steam in recent weeks, with northern Ontario MP Charlie Angus and B.C. MP Peter Julian also in the running.\n\nA leadership debate is scheduled for March 12 in Ottawa.\n\nManitoba MP Niki Ashton and deputy Ontario NDP leader Jagmeet Singh are also said to be considering a bid.\n\nA new leader is scheduled to be chosen by the end of October.",

He quit that position earlier this month to consider a leadership run.\n\nDescribing a national atmosphere of \u201ceconomic anxiety,\u201d Caron pitched himself Monday as a socialist with smart fiscal and economic policy ideas.\n\n\u201cThe political and economic class has relegated the needs of people to the bottom of their list of priorities, throwing crumbs from time to time to appease them,\u201d Caron said.\n\n\u201cOpportunistic leaders are taking advantage of the current economic situation to push policies based on fear and division \u2026. There is a better way. Progressives have a duty to propose a credible plan to bring meaningful change to an economic system that leaves most Canadians behind.\u201d\n\nHe accused Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of effecting little of the change he promised.\n\nIn his bilingual address, Caron described how he helped lay the NDP\u2019s foundations in Quebec, including running three times unsuccessfully for the NDP before finally being elected.\n\nHis campaign will criss-cross Quebec with several events throughout the week, culminating in an event in Rimouski this weekend.\n\nCaron\u2019s announcement comes the day after Northern Ontario MP Charlie Angus threw his hat in the ring in an event Sunday at a Toronto concert venue which also addressed the theme of economic disparity.\n\nRelated\n\nB.C.

The Winter Relief Program is one of many changes we will be undertaking.\u201d\n\nIt appears Hydro One was feeling pressure from small businesses, like Luc\u2019s Pizza and Eatery, too.\n\nProprietor Luc Noel immediately went to the media, sharing the story of a family trying to live out their dream of opening a restaurant serving home-cooked meals and delicious thin crust pizza\u2014a dream that was dashed due to sky-high hydro bills. The attention he received was instant.\n\nSoon after the media frenzy, Hydro One reached out to Mr. Noel and his wife Karen, suggesting the two work out a deal.\n\n\u201cThey contacted us and said \u2018we need to resolve this\u2019,\u201d Mr. Noel told The Expositor. \u201cI said \u2018I can tell you right now, I don\u2019t have the money\u2019.\u201d\n\nMr. Noel proposed a $1,000/month payment on top of their monthly bill\u2014this would clear the debt in one year\u2019s time. The Hydro One representative countered with a $5,000 payment, with the rest of the $7,000 debt wiped clean.\n\nOn Monday of last week Mr. Noel had rounded up the money, deposited it into his bank account, informed Hydro One, and within two hours the hydro was back on.\n\nMr. Noel noted the restaurant lost a lot of money by having to throw out all the food when the power was turned off and is currently raising the capital needed to buy groceries for a fresh start. By Saturday the restaurant was open.\n\nMr. Noel said customers can expect a slight increase in prices, \u201cbut nothing major.\u201d\n\nThe family is also looking to rid the restaurant of some of its electrical equipment in favour of propane as a cost savings measure. The husband and wife team will also be largely running the operation themselves, also to save money as they start back up again.\n\n\u201cThis place has potential,\u201d he added.\n\nMr. Noel told The Expositor that while he is pleased with Hydro One\u2019s response, he informed them \u201cthey need to fix the larger problem.\u201d He has spent plenty of time going over his bills and is baffled as to why their off-peak hours see the highest consumption\u2014the time when the doors are closed and the ovens are off. \u201cIt\u2019s costing almost twice as much when there is no one there,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to give it another kick at the cat,\u201d Mr. Noel said. \u201cIf it doesn\u2019t go this time, we lose everything, and that\u2019s the disheartening part.\u201d\n\nWhen contacted by The Expositor, Hydro One spokesperson Nancy Clark said that while she cannot comment on a specific case, the \u201cWinter Relief Program was created to help our residential customers facing extreme hardship get reconnected during the winter. Hydro One works with residential customers and businesses on a case-by-case basis, to help get and keep their accounts in good standing.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are changing the way we do business and are committed to being a customer-focused, well-managed company,\u201d Ms. Clark added. \u201cWe are working to keep our costs down and keep any increases on our portion of the bill, the delivery line, to what is required to ensure that electricity is delivered to our customers when and where they need it.\u201d\n\nLast week the premier announced further relief coming to Northern and rural residents of the province who are facing \u201ceven more of a challenge\u201d in paying their electricity bills. This comes on top of the $1 billion in a year in HST rebates already announced by the province.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s long overdue,\u201d Algoma-Manitoulin MPP Michael Mantha told The Expositor, referencing the premier\u2019s news of a relief program.\n\n\u201cOntarians, particularly Northern Ontarians, have been asking for this for a long time,\u201d he added.\n\nThe MPP noted how beneficial it was to bring the Hydro One Ombudsman and Mr. Pugliese to Manitoulin to hear the concerns of residents firsthand as well as suggestions on how Hydro One can be more helpful to residents and businesses alike.\n\n\u201cThere is light at the end of the tunnel,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Mantha spoke of his work with Legions in the riding and seeing their bills credited or changes made to their billing, as well as area not-for-profits that were also struggling to keep the lights on.\n\n\u201cI keep hearing, day in and day out, about delivery fees\u2014deliver fees that are higher than the actual usage,\u201d the MPP continued.\n\nMr. Mantha said he is looking forward to getting back to Queen\u2019s Park and especially the February 28 debate on the proposed legislation concerning Hydro One. \u201cI look forward to questioning some of those decisions and ensuring they are not just a splash, something that looks good on paper, but actual, tangible savings that allow residents to pay their rent and put food in the cupboards.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is the most important decision bar none\u201480 percent of the complaints that come into my office are about hydro,\u201d Mr. Mantha added.\n\nHe spoke of a recent constituency clinic on Manitoulin where he met with a widowed pensioner who had been paying Hydro One bills that ranged from $700 to $1,400 a month. \u201cShe was in tears,\u201d he said. Together they reviewed her bill and identified issues to bring to Hydro One\u2019s attention which will mean a savings moving forward.\n\n\u201cThere are so many proud people who just don\u2019t ask questions, they just pay it,\u201d he continued.\n\nMr. Mantha said he was overjoyed to hear the news of Mr. Noel and his family, with whom he had met last month.\n\n\u201cLuc and his family show the true spirit and heart of not giving up,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m happy to see that Hydro One responded and am very happy he\u2019ll be reopening. I know they\u2019ll do well and that the community will support them.\u201d\n\nHydro One encourages any customer experiencing difficulties paying their bill to contact the customer communications centre at 1-888-664-9376.", 
        "body1": "Ed Clark was given cabinet approval to serve as the premier\u2019s business advisor until March 31, 2018. Bernard Weil / Toronto Star ) Order this photo\n\nPremier Kathleen Wynne has quietly re-appointed the man behind booze in supermarkets and the Hydro One sell-off as her unpaid privatization guru. Ed Clark, the former TD Bank CEO, was given cabinet approval earlier this month to serve as the premier\u2019s business advisor until March 31, 2018. That\u2019s according to an order in council dated Feb. 2 and filed Feb. 17. Clark, a Bay Street titan and public policy wonk, is by far the most influential volunteer in Ontario politics. He was the key architect of the blueprint updating the province\u2019s liquor laws that harkened back to the end of Prohibition in 1927.\n\nArticle Continued Below\n\nThanks to his efforts, beer, wine, and cider is on many supermarket shelves and will be available at hundreds more outlets by 2025. But that meant effectively breaking the government-owned Liquor Control Board of Ontario and private Beer Store duopoly that controlled one of the world\u2019s most lucrative booze markets. More controversially, Clark also recommended the sale of 60 per cent of Hydro One, the provincial electricity transmitter, which will generate $9 billion.\n\nOf that, $5 billion will clear the utility\u2019s debt and the remaining $4 billion of the share offering\u2019s proceeds will help bankroll new public transit, roads and bridges. Both Progressive Conservative Leader Patrick Brown and NDP Leader Andrea Horwath oppose the majority sale of Hydro One, warning it could lead to higher electricity rates. Clark has countered that, saying a better run, more efficient company could actually find savings that would be passed along to ratepayers. The business czar was also called upon last fall to examine eHealth Ontario, the province\u2019s oft-troubled electronic health records agency. He concluded it has provided \u201csignificantly\u201d more than $5.7 billion in value to the health-care system over the past decade, but can be improved. In a 48-page report, Clark said when he was running TD Bank, they had 23 million customers across North America and were able to provide safe and secure access while protecting privacy. \u201cThe technical issues of running such a system and running a health-care data system are not so different. The people and organizational issues certainly are,\u201d he noted. But Clark insisted government-run information technology projects are not necessarily worse than those in the private sector. \u201cI\u2019m not so sure that governments are so terrible at it. The fact is that you don\u2019t get to hear about all the mistakes that the private sector makes on their projects and the private sector has a different attitude to mistakes,\u201d he said in November. \u201cIn Silicon Valley, they celebrate when projects go bad because they view it as a huge learning experience, whereas in government you then have an inquiry and the whole system goes quiet and says \u2018Oh my God, let\u2019s take the most conservative approach.\u2019\u201d Clark\u2019s conclusions led Health Minister Eric Hoskins to order a revamp for eHealth to help doctors and nurses improve service for patients. Currently, he is focused on helping Wynne find ways to reduce red tape by cutting back on the regulatory burden facing businesses in Ontario.\n\nRead more about:",

        "body0": "He raised more than $1 million for two experimental cancer treatments, and moved a community to rally behind him.\n\nBut on the weekend, Laval\u2019s Matthew Schreindorfer, 27, died, his wife Katia Luciani confirmed on Facebook Monday morning.\n\n\u201cMatt never gave up and fought until the absolute end! He went with serenity, acceptance and happiness with everything he had accomplished in his short, but amazing life; feeling he had done what he needed to do,\u201d Luciani wrote on the Facebook Page dedicated to raising money for the treatments. \u201cHe was at peace with leaving us.\u201d\n\nLuciani asked the media for privacy and said the family would not give interviews.\n\nShortly after the couple\u2019s honeymoon in 2014, Schreindorfer, then 25, came down with flu-like symptoms and sought treatment. Doctors initially believed he had caught a virus overseas, then mononucleosis, but further tests revealed something far more serious \u2014 acute lymphoblastic leukemia, an aggressive blood cancer.\n\nChemotherapy and immunotherapy treatments, and a clinical trial in Quebec failed to stop the cancer\u2019s relentless progression. Schreindorfer was offered palliative care.\n\nSchreindorfer and his family then embarked on a public fundraising campaign and successfully raised more than $800,000 to fund an experimental but promising treatment at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York.\n\nThe experimental gene therapy, called CART-19, manipulates the patient\u2019s own immune system to recognize and kill their own cancer cells. The treatment is not yet offered in Canada, but several clinical trials could be offered in the future.\n\nSchreindorfer got into the clinical trial in New York, and the therapy initially worked. Schreindorfer was given a bone-marrow transplant. However, the cancer returned last year.\n\n\u201cIt worked for eight to nine months, and unfortunately he relapsed,\u201d Luciani told the Montreal Gazette in February.\n\nUndaunted, the couple was in the midst of raising funds for the same CART-19 treatment, this time in Seattle. The couple said they were encouraged by a discovery that Schreindorfer had a gene mutation that causes the cancer to come back \u2014 and a small dose of a particular drug, Ruxolitinib, could halt the relapse. He was about halfway through raising the $700,000 needed for the second treatment, which was set to begin in the coming weeks or months. He was receiving what\u2019s called a bridge treatment to prepare for that treatment.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a mess of infections and other issues (kidney damage, lung issues, etc.),\u201d Schreindorfer wrote in a Facebook post on Jan. 22. \u201cThese problems prevented us from starting the \u2018bridge\u2019 treatment earlier, hence letting my disease gain more and more ground every day.\n\n\u201cFriday, we finally got the approval to start the Inotuzomab \u2018bridge\u2019 treatment! We were so excited, hence the picture! I\u2019ve barely had any side effects when I\u2019ve received it in the past, so we hope everything will run as smoothly this time around. My breathing has become a little bit more difficult, though, but that was slightly to be expected seeing as I have active disease in my lungs.\u201d\n\nIn a Feb. 4 blog post on HelpSaveMatthew.com, Schreindorfer said he had received the second bridge treatment and was in terrible pain, but confident. He sent his gratitude to supporters.\n\nRelated\n\n\u201cI also wanted to take a moment to thank everyone who sends us such inspiring stories through our Facebook page or our helpsavematthew.com blog,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt really helps us get through our days, encourages us and gives us hope that we will one day have a normal life with a beautiful family to enjoy it with.\u201d\n\nIn her post on Monday, Luciani said all the money raised for the treatment will be given to organizations raising money for research and for patient care. She encouraged those who have already conducted fundraisers for Schreindorfer but who have not yet turned the money in to donate it to a cause close to their hearts. In lieu of flowers, the family asks for people to register become bone marrow donors.\n\njmagder@postmedia.com\n\nTwitter.com/JasonMagder\n\nFacebook.com/JasonMagderJournalist",

When Justin went to Washington, he got very good advice and he played it very well,\u201d said Charles McMillan, former senior policy adviser to then-prime minister Mulroney, in an interview with The Hill Times. \u201cI would say he\u2019s the only Canadian who has close connections to Trump and the entourage.\u201d\n\nAt the two-day retreat held Jan. 22-23, Mr. Schwarzman, head of Mr. Trump\u2019s Strategic and Policy Forum consisting of 16 top business leaders from Wall Street and Silicon Valley, met with Prime Minister Trudeau (Papineau, Que.) and the cabinet. After the meetings, the U.S. businessman told reporters that he doesn\u2019t think Canada should be \u201cenormously worried [about trade relationship between the two countries] because Canada is held in very high regard\u201d adding that the trade between the two countries is \u201cvery much in balance.\u201d\n\nLike most other governments around the world, Mr. Trump\u2019s election victory took the Liberal government and the top echelons of the public service by surprise. One key concern, amongst others, for all top Canadian officials was the real estate billionaire\u2019s aggressive protectionist trade rhetoric during the Republican primary and the general election campaign. In campaign speeches and other public comments, Mr. Trump described the North American Free Trade Agreement as a disaster for the U.S. and blasted China, Japan and Germany with allegations of currency manipulation. Mr. Trump also promised to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border to plug the inflow of illegal immigrants to the U.S.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs the largest trading partner, Canada\u2019s economy is heavily dependent on the trade with the U.S. as more than $2-billion worth of goods are traded each day between the two countries.\n\nThe U.S. presidential election took place on Nov. 8 and Parliament was not in session that week. So, a day after the election, Mr. Trudeau held a conference call with all Liberal MPs advising them not to say anything negative about the new president. On Jan. 10, Mr. Trudeau shuffled his cabinet to deal with the changed political landscape in the U.S. He appointed Chrystia Freeland (University-Rosedale, Ont.) as the new Foreign Affairs minister and rookie Liberal MP Francois-Philippe Champagne (St. Maurice-Champlain, Que.) as the new minister of International Trade.\n\nAnother source close to Mr. Mulroney, who did not want to be identified, told The Hill Times that after the U.S. election, the top Canadian government officials did not have many contacts in Mr. Trump\u2019s inner circle. Gerald Butts, principal secretary to Mr. Trudeau, reached out to Mr. Mulroney to seek advice. The former prime minister who is a neighbour of Mr. Trump\u2019s in Palm Beach, Florida has friends and acquaintances in both the Republican Party and the Democratic Party and was \u201chappy to help.\u201d Mr. Mulroney has spoken to Mr. Trudeau numerous times and has offered advice.\n\nIn the run-up to Mr. Trudeau\u2019s successful visit to Washington D.C. on Feb. 14, the source said, the Trudeau team consulted Mr. Mulroney regularly.\n\n\n\n\n\nMr. Mulroney, who served as prime minister from 1984-1993, currently is a senior partner with the law firm of Norton Rose Fulbright and spends a lot of time in New York, Washington, D.C., and Florida for business reasons.\n\nMr. McMillan said his former boss is one of the most well-connected Canadian politicians in the world, adding that political and business leaders reach out to the former prime minister on a regular basis. In the U.S., he said, Mr. Mulroney has had friendly relationships with all U.S. presidents going back to Ronald Regan, and other top politicians both in the Republican and Democratic parties. Mr. McMillan said Mr. Mulroney knows many members of Mr. Trump\u2019s inner circle, including U.S. Vice President Mike Pence, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, and Energy Secretary Rick Perry.\n\n\u201cIt is hardly a surprise that he has known Donald Trump for many years, and many in his cabinet and circle of advisers, such as Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, Wilbur Ross, and energy secretary, Rick Perry, and VP Pence, just as`he was close with President Obama, Hillary Clinton, John Kerry, the late Senator Ted Kennedy and VP Joe Biden,\u201d Mr. McMillan, who now is a professor of strategic management and international business at York University\u2019s Schulich School of Business in Toronto, later wrote in an email to The Hill Times.\n\n\u201cPersonally, I find that in a world of globalization, political and technological uncertainty, successful political incumbent political leaders seek out external advice and counsel from people like Brian Mulroney, especially when the advice is forthright, honest, and private.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nMr. Mulroney recently sang When Irish Eyes are Smiling at Mr. Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago private club in Florida for the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute fundraiser. In 1985, the former prime minister and his wife Mila joined then-U.S. president Ronald Reagan and his wife Nancy in singing this song at the \u201cShamrock Summit\u201d in Qu\u00e9bec City.\n\nThe Prime Minister\u2019s Office declined to discuss any specifics related to Mr. Mulroney\u2019s work in helping out the Trudeau government in Canada-U.S. relations.\n\n\u201cWe are drawing upon advice from different Canadians who have offered to help, and we are pleased the former prime minister has been able to be helpful bridge to Republicans, including the president, underscoring the unique relationship between our two countries,\u201d said PMO press secretary Cameron Ahmed in an email to The Hill Times. \u201cThe Prime Minister has spoken with the former prime minister on a few occasions, and we look forward to continuing to work with the former prime minister.\u201d\n\nTransport Minister Marc Garneau (Notre-Dame-de-Gr\u00e2ce-Westmount, Que.), chair of the Cabinet Committee on Canada-United States Relations, also declined to discuss any specifics about Mr. Mulroney\u2019s work, but confirmed that Mr. Mulroney is not getting paid for this work.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s doing it as somebody who wants to foster good relationship [between the two countries],\u201d said Mr. Garneau.\n\nMr. Garneau said he invited Mr. Mulroney to attend a meeting of the cabinet committee and talk to the members about Canada-U.S. relations. He added that the committee chose to invite the former prime minister in order to learn more from his political experience, knowledge, and contacts in the U.S. political and business communities. Members of the Canada-United States Relations Cabinet Committee include: Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale (Regina-Wascana, Sask.), Government House Leader Bardish Chagger (Waterloo, Ont.), International Trade Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne (St-Maurice-Champlain, Que.), Science Minister Kirsty Duncan (Etobicoke North, Ont.), Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland (University Rosedale, Ont.), Democratic Reform Minister Karina Gould (Burlington, Ont.), Immigration Minister Ahmed Hussen (York South-Weston, Ont.), Agriculture Minister Lawrence MacAulay (Cardigan, P.E. I.), Environment Minister Catherine McKenna (Ottawa Centre, Ont.) and Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan (Vancouver South, B.C.).\n\n\u201cI will be inviting him and he will be coming to speak to the Canada-U.S. relations cabinet committee in the coming months, and, so we will have an opportunity to hear from him personally as a group,\u201d said Mr. Garneau.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s based on his experience and knowledge of business people and politicians in the United States.\u201d\n\nMr. Mulroney has known Prime Minister Trudeau since he was a child. But, the relationship between the two has warmed up since 2013. At the time, Mr. Mulroney warned that no one should underestimate Mr. Trudeau as a politician.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve known Justin since he was a child. He\u2019s young, articulate, attractive\u2014a flawlessly bilingual young man. What\u2019s not to like with this picture?\u201d Mr. Mulroney told CTV in April 2013 and warned that anyone who \u201ctreats Justin Trudeau with scorn or derision or underestimates him, does so at his own peril.\u201d He described Mr. Trudeau as \u201ca man of some consequence\u201d in the same interview.\n\nTwo months ago, the Government of France awarded Mr. Mulroney the highest civilian honour. At a ceremony at the French Embassy in Ottawa, Nicola Chapuis, the French ambassador presented the former prime minister the insignia of Commander of the National Order of the Legion of Honour for his efforts in promoting France-Canada relations and La Francophonie. Mr. Trudeau also attended this ceremony among others.\n\nAnd in early December, Prime Minister Trudeau personally invited Mr. Mulroney at the farewell dinner for outgoing U.S. vice president Joe Biden in Ottawa.\n\nMeanwhile, veteran Liberal MP Wayne Easter (Malpeque, P.E.I.), chairman of the Canada-U.S. Inter-Parliamentary Group, told The Hill Times that he supports Mr. Trudeau\u2019s decision to seek help from Mulroney in promoting the Canada-U.S. relationship. He said that the Canadian and U.S. officials interact at several levels with each other, including Prime Minister to President, cabinet to cabinet, provincial premiers to state governors and parliamentarians to congressmen. He said all these interactions are important to strengthen the relationship between the two countries.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a great move to bring in other players. This is an issue where partisan self interest shouldn\u2019t come into [play],\u201d Mr. Easter said. \u201cThis is about the interest of our economy in Canada and in North America and no one better than Brian Mulroney, who knows President Trump personally, to do what he can to help.\u201d\n\narana@hilltimes.com\n\nThe Hill Times",

Nach ungen\u00fcgendem Sommertraining musste er zwischendurch schon mal f\u00fcr eine Partie aussetzen damit der Schnauf noch reicht.

Sie k\u00f6nnen ihn ja nicht mehr ersetzen. Es sind praktische und vern\u00fcnftige \u00dcberlegungen.\n\nGeben wir Langnaus Pr\u00e4sident Peter Jakob das Wort \u2013 und wir werden verstehen, wie es zu diesem \u00abVerrat\u00bb in Zeiten des Abstiegskampfes kommen konnte.\n\n\u00abDie Art und Weise wie er uns verl\u00e4sst, goutieren wir nicht.\u00bb\n\n\u00abAm letzten Donnerstag konfrontierte uns Chris DiDomenico mit einer NHL-Offerte. Er k\u00f6nne mit einem Einwegvertrag bis Ende Saison nach Ottawa wechseln und bekomme f\u00fcr die n\u00e4chste Saison einen Zweiwegvertrag. Er war sehr emotional. Als wir ihm erkl\u00e4rten, er k\u00f6nne uns jetzt nicht verlassen, sagte er, seine Karriere sei zerst\u00f6rt, wenn er nicht in die NHL wechseln d\u00fcrfe. Er habe sein ganzes Leben lang auf diese Chance gewartet. Da ist uns klargeworden, dass es keinen Sinn macht, ihn festzuhalten. Er ist ein sehr emotionaler Spieler und ein frustrierter Chris DiDomenico h\u00e4tte uns nichts mehr gebracht und wahrscheinlich sogar Unruhe in die Mannschaft getragen.\n\nBild: KEYSTONE\n\nWir haben noch eine Kompromissl\u00f6sung gesucht. Ein Wechsel per sofort nach Ottawa und Ottawa h\u00e4tte uns den Spieler leihweise bis zur Entscheidung in unserer Meisterschaft \u00fcberlassen. Aber das war nicht machbar. Und so haben wir am Sonntagabend den Vertrag mit sofortiger Wirkung aufgel\u00f6st und Chris DiDomenico den Wechsel in die NHL erm\u00f6glicht. Wir erhalten keine Abl\u00f6sesumme. Aber es ist in diesem Fall auch nicht um Geld gegangen. Chris DiDomenico hat viel f\u00fcr uns geleistet und wir sind ihm daf\u00fcr dankbar. Aber die Art und Weise wie er uns verl\u00e4sst, goutieren wir nicht und er hat uns mit diesem Abgang entt\u00e4uscht.\u00bb\n\nDie Freigabe ist ein vern\u00fcnftiger und letztlich der einzig m\u00f6gliche und richtige Entscheid. Wer jetzt denkt, die Emmentaler seien etwas gar nachgiebig, t\u00e4uscht sich. Es gibt zu dieser Entscheidung n\u00e4mlich noch einen Hintergedanken, den niemand ausspricht, ja, der jeder weit von sich weist: Chris DiDomenico h\u00e4tte noch einen Vertrag f\u00fcr die n\u00e4chste Saison gehabt. Der Kanadier ist nach wie vor sehr popul\u00e4r bei den Fans. Aber seine Leistungen entsprachen diese Saison bei weitem nicht mehr seiner Popularit\u00e4t. \u00abDido\u00bb ist inzwischen einer der meist\u00fcbersch\u00e4tzten Spieler der Liga.\n\nNHL-Professionalit\u00e4t nicht \u00fcbersch\u00e4tzen\n\nEine vorzeitige Vertragsaufl\u00f6sung per Ende Saison wegen ungen\u00fcgenden Leistungen h\u00e4tte eigentlich ein Thema sein m\u00fcssen.

Ein Spieler verl\u00e4sst sein Team von einem Tag auf den anderen in der entscheidenden Phase der Saison und zu einem Zeitpunkt, zu dem es nicht mehr m\u00f6glich ist, einen Ersatzmann zu verpflichten. Das hat es so in der Neuzeit noch nicht gegeben. Aber das sportliche Risiko ist \u00fcberschaubar: Die Langnauer belegen mit elf Punkten Vorsprung den rettenden 10. Platz und es sind nur noch sechs Partien zu spielen. F\u00e4llt nicht noch der Kirchturm auf den B\u00e4ren, dann sind die Langnauer gerettet.\n\nDie Karriere von Chris DiDomenico ist mit diesem Transfer zumindest in der Schweiz zu Ende. Er wird sich in der NHL nicht durchsetzen und einen \u00e4hnlich guten Vertrag wie in Langnau in der NLA nicht mehr bekommen. Den Schwefelgeruch des Verr\u00e4ters wird er nicht mehr los.\n\nBild: AP/The Canadian Press\n\nDie Frage ist, wie denn das Ottawas famoses Trainerduo Guy Boucher/Marc Crawford dazu kommt, einen St\u00fcrmer wie Chris DiDomenico zu verpflichten.

        "body1": "Theatre by the Lake today announces full cast for the world premi\u00e8re of Nicholas Pierpan's play William Wordsworth. Michael Oakley directs Daniel Abelson (Coleridge), Amiera Darwish (Sara), Richard Evans (Atkinson/Elderly Man), Joseph Mydell (George Beaumont), Emma Pallant (Dorothy), Paul Ryan (Peter Garner/Lonsdale's Secretary), John Sackville (Wordsworth), Rosalind Steele (Mrs Coleridge) and Terence Wilton (Lord Lonsdale/Beggar Man). A co-production with English Touring Theatre, William Wordsworth opens at Theatre by the Lake on 4 April and runs until 22 April.\n\nIt's Spring 1812 and in the parlour of Grasmere Rectory amongst the piles of washing, smoking chimneys and children running riot, William Wordsworth writes.\n\n\n\nIt's been years since Lyrical Ballads and money is tight. Much to the dismay of his sister Dorothy, Wordsworth is not penning his long awaited next book of verse but a letter to his friend Coleridge attempting a reconciliation to their fractured relationship.\n\n\n\nColeridge has been busy trampling Wordsworth's reputation amongst the literary elite down in London, but the Wordsworth family have more pressing problems than protecting William's reputation. Conditions in the family home are so bad that his wife has fled for the health of their new-born baby. With no money coming in, the daily dilemma of having freedom to pursue his art while providing for his family is reaching breaking point.\n\n\n\nNicholas Pierpan's poignant new play looks at the man behind the name and explores how some of the most beautiful and startling poetry in history came to be created.\n\nNicholas Pierpan won the 2013 Off West End Award for Most Promising New Playwright and was nominated for an Evening Standard Award for his play You Can Still Make a Killing.

On Feb. 9, Whole Foods said one of the two locations in Boulder would be shuttered as well as a location in Colorado Springs.\n\nThe store closing on Capitol Hill is not included among the nine stores Whole Foods is closing. The company is referring to it as a \u201crelocation,\u201d according to Whole Foods spokeswoman Betsy Harden.\n\nThe Denver news site BusinessDen first reported the closing Thursday.\n\nOn Friday, a member of the leadership team at the Whole Foods Market in Cap Hill \u2014 who asked not to be identified \u2014 said he learned a couple days ago that his store at the southeast corner of East 11th Avenue and North Emerson Street would be closing.\n\nThe roughly 100 employees at the store have the option of working at the new location under construction near 17th and Wewatta streets. Those in leadership roles, including himself, have been asked to reapply for their jobs, he said.\n\nHe expects the Cap Hill store to close shortly before Whole Foods opens its location near Union Station during October 2017.\n\nWhen asked why Whole Foods decided not to keep both the Cap Hill store and new location, Harden said, \u201cWe\u2019re opening the newer, larger Union Station location to provide a better customer shopping experience.\u201d\n\nAs of September 25, Whole Foods operated 456 stores in the U.S., Canada and Britain. Colorado had the sixth highest number of Whole Food locations (20) behind California (85), Massachusettes (31), Texas (29), Florida (26) and Illinois (26), according to the company\u2019s annual report.\n\nSales have been increasing annually for Whole Foods to a record $15.7 billion during fiscal 2016, but so have operating costs and expenses. The grocer saw net income drop by $29 million from 2015 to 2016, according to the report.\n\n\u201cWhat has become clear is that we don\u2019t want to compete in a race to the bottom, as consumers have ever-increasing choices for how and where they shop,\u201d Whole Foods CEO and co-founder John Mackey said this month during an investors call.\n\nWhole Foods opened 13 stores (including two relocations) during the 16 weeks leading up to Jan. 15.\n\n\u201cWe will continue to grow but no longer have a goal of 1200+ stores,\u201d Mackey said. \u201cWe are also continually evaluating stores on a case-by-case basis, balancing the age, size and performance trends of the store with the potential returns from additional capital investments, monitoring lease renewals, and taking into account how each store fits into our longer-term strategy for that particular market.\u201d\n\nBusiness & data reporter Adrian D.
