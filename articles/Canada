        "body0": "The Liberal governments in Ottawa and Quebec City appear to be trying to close the door on the pay hike controversy at Bombardier Inc., saying the plane maker took appropriate action in wake of the uproar.\n\nBut opposition politicians pressed on with criticism of the compensation increases, hammering the Liberals at both levels of government for offering Bombardier public money that helped fund millions in raises for its senior leadership.\n\n\u201cIt would be one thing if we knew that the money was being used to create jobs or maybe to balance the budget, but instead, part of it is going to Bombardier so it can pay its [executives] millions of dollars,\u201d interim Conservative Leader Rona Ambrose said. \u201cHow can \u2026 the Prime Minister continue to defend this deal?\u201d\n\nRead more: At Bombardier, ownership is a relative term\n\nRead more: Widespread anger clouds Bombardier\u2019s backtrack on executive pay\n\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau was not in the Commons Tuesday. Innovation Minister Navdeep Bains, whose portfolio includes economic development, acknowledged public anger over the pay issue but sought to portray Ottawa\u2019s Feb. 7 pledge of $372.5-million in loans to Bombardier as having a wider benefit than to the plane maker itself.\n\n\u201cI understand the concerns of Canadians and Quebeckers,\u201d the minister told the House of Commons. \u201cThis investment was not only about one company but it was about a supplier base to help the small businesses that support the aerospace sector.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Conservative Senator Leo Housakos is trying to get the Senate\u2019s transport committee to probe the federal government\u2019s recent loan to Bombardier in the wake of the public backlash over the pay increases.\n\nMr. Housakos plans to move a motion as early as Wednesday seeking the consent of the Senate to launch a transport committee inquiry into the federal aid. He wants to learn whether the Trudeau government set conditions on how the money is spent in light of Bombardier\u2019s pay proposal.\n\nIn Quebec City, the province\u2019s three opposition parties demanded the government make an official request to Bombardier asking for senior executives to renounce their raises. The ruling Liberals blocked their motions on this and two related matters from being debated.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t believe that it\u2019s the role of government to stick its nose into the internal management of companies,\u201d Quebec Premier Philippe Couillard said after being asked why he isn\u2019t taking any further action in the matter.\n\nThe Premier said Quebeckers\u2019 trust and affection toward Montreal-based Bombardier has been \u201cconsiderably weakened\u201d since last Thursday when news spread that the company\u2019s 2016 compensation package included a collective 48-per-cent pay increase for its six top executives. Indignation has centred on how the company could offer such pay increases when it was saved from the brink of bankruptcy by a $1-billion (U.S.) equity investment by Quebec in its flagship C Series airliner.\n\nHowever, Bombardier\u2019s response since then has been the right one, Mr. Couillard said. Pierre Beaudoin, Bombardier\u2019s executive chairman, renounced his pay raise on Friday. Chief executive officer Alain Bellemare then proposed to delay half the $32.6-million the company planned to pay its senior executives in 2016 an extra year to 2020 while making it contingent on reaching \u201cperformance goals\u201d in line with the company\u2019s five-year strategic plan.\n\nTargets contained in the plan include boosting the margin on earnings before interest and taxes to 8 per cent, growing revenue to $25-billion and generating $1-billion in cash. The company posted a $981-million loss last year on revenue of $16.4-billion.\n\nMr. Bellemare was hired to put Bombardier back on track after the company nearly collapsed amid a cash crunch in 2015, assembling a strong team of senior executives with international calibre. He suggested that he needs a competitive pay policy to keep his team intact.\n\nIf the investment Quebec made is not profitable, there will be no increases for the executives, Mr. Couillard said. \u201c[And if it is], everyone wins.\u201d\n\nThe trouble with the Premier seeking to push past this controversy is that it risks putting him at odds with the mood of Quebeckers. In a L\u00e9ger poll released Sunday morning by Le Journal de Montr\u00e9al, 90 per cent of respondents said Bombardier\u2019s senior executives should renounce the pay increase they were awarded.\n\n\u201cThe coals are still very hot\u201d on this issue, said Christian Bourque, L\u00e9ger\u2019s executive vice-president. \u201cPeople were hurt by it.\u201d\n\nQuebec\u2019s three opposition parties argue the fact that the government was blindsided by Bombardier\u2019s pay package shows it needs to flex some muscle with the company given the level of taxpayer support that was pledged to rescue the manufacturer.\n\n\u201cBombardier showed a disregard for Quebeckers, thinking that this would be acceptable,\u201d Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois leader Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Lis\u00e9e told reporters. \u201cIt\u2019s scandalous.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen a company like Bombardier makes the choice to find a public or semi-public partner there are consequences,\u201d said Fran\u00e7ois Legault, head of the Coalition Avenir Qu\u00e9bec party. He said it is no longer beholden to shareholders alone.\n\nReport Typo/Error",

Bissonnette faces six counts of first-degree murder and five of attempted murder using a restricted firearm. ( MATHIEU BELANGER / THE CANADIAN PRESS )\n\nQUEBEC\u2014The accused in Quebec City's deadly mosque shooting formally changed lawyers on Thursday during a brief court hearing. Alexandre Bissonnette, 27, appeared briefly before Quebec court Judge Jean-Louis Lemay and acknowledged he was bringing in a new attorney. Bissonnette faces six counts of first-degree murder and five of attempted murder using a restricted firearm arising from the Jan. 29 deaths. Jean Petit, a defence lawyer who had been representing Bissonnette since his arrest, recused himself. He was replaced by Charles-Olivier Gosselin, a legal-aid lawyer.\n\nArticle Continued Below\n\nWhat happened the night of the Quebec mosque attack Dressed in a black shirt, Bissonnette was attentive during the proceedings as he sat behind a glassed-in prisoner's box. Asked by the judge if he wished to change his legal representation, Bissonnette responded, \"Yes sir.\" The case was then put off until May 29. Mosque president Mohamed Yangui said he still fears going to the mosque where Mamadou Tanou Barry, Ibrahima Barry, Azzeddine Soufiane, Abdelkrim Hassane, Khaled Belkacemi and Aboubaker Thabti were killed.\n\nPeople left flowers, candles and signs with messages of peace at a makeshift memorial near the Quebec City mosque on Feb. 1 where a shooting left six people dead. ( The Canadian Press )\n\nThe six victims, aged between 39 and 60, died when a gunman stormed the mosque and opened fire on men who were attending prayer. Nineteen people were wounded in the attack and Bissonnette was arrested shortly after the incident. \"It's very difficult,\" Yangui told reporters after the proceedings. \"I can't express my feelings today. When I go to the mosque now, I can't pray properly. I always have the feeling there's someone behind me who will shoot me.\" He said the mosque has received other threats since the shootings, which were called a terrorist act by both Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Quebec Premier Philippe Couillard. Yangui said he will fight to the end to have the acts declared as terrorist. Exceptional security measures were still in effect Thursday at the Quebec City courthouse, where each person was subject to a pat-down and a metal-detector search before being permitted to enter the courtroom.\n\nRead more about:",

However, if the owners are ever going to make real inroads and eventually real revenue in Asia, what better chance will they get than back-to-back Winter Games in Asia? Yes, they want to go to Beijing and China much more than they do Pyeongchang, but continuity matters, and the I.O.C. may not fling the door back open for 2022.

Best to wait until the official start of the Northern Hemisphere summer to count the N.H.L. truly out.\n\nBest, too, to wait until the bids come in for 2026 to start counting the Winter Olympics out.\n\nThe I.O.C. has approved its so-called Agenda 2020, which allows a more flexible approach to bidding. That could be particularly well suited to Winter Olympic candidates, which could deploy national bids or multinational bids to share infrastructure costs and cover the disparate bases of an event that needs not only big arenas for ice sports but also mountains steep and imposing enough to run a proper downhill (as well as a city big enough to house the bloated Olympic circus, media members like myself included).\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s an existential crisis for the Winter Olympics; I want to be clear about that,\u201d said Koss, founder of the Canadian-based humanitarian organization Right to Play. \u201cI think Korea will be successful, and I think there are some things in Agenda 2020 that might be helpful, but it hasn\u2019t been seen in practice yet.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHe does think the lack of clarity on sanctions against athletes implicated in the Sochi doping scandal is hurting public perception of the Winter Olympics. \u201cThe feeling is, why hasn\u2019t this been dealt with properly?\u201d Koss said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nWhat could definitely be existential is climate change, and Koss agrees that the I.O.C. needs to prioritize the environmental factor as much as possible in its Winter Olympic choices.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cOf course it\u2019s self-interest because if it gets too much warmer, there won\u2019t be any more Winter Olympics because we won\u2019t have any more snow,\u201d he said. \u201cSo it\u2019s a natural.

But ultimately, having fun is her number one priority at the moment.'\n\nLooking cosy: Kendall and A$AP Rocky, pictured in Paris in January, were first linked last year\n\nNo confirmation: Kendall and ASAP have yet to publicly talk about their relationship\n\nThe latest news comes after Kendall's sister Kylie split from her beau Tyga with a source recently confirming the end of their two year romance.\n\n'They tend to take little breaks all the time and then get back together,' a friend of the couple told People magazine about the split, adding: 'It\u2019s definitely possible they\u2019ll work things out again.'\n\nKeeping Up With The Kardashians star Kylie has been in an on/off romance with the Rack City hitmaker since 2014.",

Although Michael doesn\u2019t see eye-to-eye with his brother, he hatches a plan to get Lincoln out of prison \u2013 landing himself in the same institution and recruiting inmates to help with his plot. The Fox River Eight, as they become known, includes Michael\u2019s cellmate Fernando Sucre, C-Note \u2013 a loyal friend and drug dealer, and T-Bag \u2013 a rapist and murderer who blackmailed his way into the group.\n\nMichael also lets prison doctor Sara Tancredi in on his plans after falling in love with her, and the pair marry at the end of the series. Throughout the course of the series the men break out of Fox River, flee the US, escape from another prison and uncover a huge government conspiracy. Ahead of Prison Break\u2019s return, here is a look back at the story so far. PRISON BREAK SEASON 5 RELEASE DATE\n\nFOX Michael Scofield's tattoo includes blueprints to Fox River Prison\n\nSeason 1 After Lincoln is imprisoned, Michael stages a bank robbery and is sent to Fox River where he meets inmates such as John Abruzzi \u2013 who helps to arrange a getaway plane, and Charles Westmoreland \u2013 also known as DB Cooper, who has $5 million hidden in cash. Michael reveals that his architecture firm had previously worked on retrofitting Fox River, meaning that he had access to its blueprints. Before the robbery, he spent four months having a huge tattoo inked on to his torso, which contains the plans to the prison and details of their escape plot. As the men prepare to escape Michael feigns diabetes in order to get daily access to the infirmary, with the intention of stealing a key from Sara. Michael and Sara become romantically involved. He tells her about his plan to break out of the prison, and asks her to leave the infirmary door unlocked on the night of the escape. Sara reluctantly helps, but her guilt drives her to overdose on pills. Meanwhile the Fox River Eight hatch their plan and successfully break out of the prison. But when they get to an air field their escape plane is nowhere to be seen.\n\nPrison Break then and now Tue, April 4, 2017 Prison Break: See Wentworth Miller, Dominic Purcell and the cast then and now.

The Fox River Eight split up to evade capture from FBI Special Agent Alex Mahone and to search for Cooper\u2019s hidden $5 million. Michael and Lincoln are reunited with Sara \u2013 who survived her suicide attempt but has turned to alcohol and drugs after being fired. It is revealed that Mahone is working for The Company \u2013 the mysterious organisation that framed Lincoln \u2013 as is the new US President Caroline Reynolds. Sara allows herself to be arrested to ensure the brothers safety, but she and Lincoln are later pardoned. Michael, T-Bag and Mahone are not so lucky and are arrested in Panama along with Bellick \u2013 a Fox River prison guard who has been chasing the escapees to win a reward. They are sent to Sona prison \u2013 a dangerous place run by inmates and guarded only from the outside following a huge riot.\n\nFOX Michael is sent to Sona in season three\n\nSeason 3 It is revealed that The Company orchestrated Michael\u2019s arrest so that he could break a man named Whistler out of Sona. While Lincoln launches his own bid to free his brother, Michael and Whistler start working from the inside to escape the prison. Lincoln is forced to negotiate with a Company operative named Gretchen Morgan, who has kidnapped his son LJ and Michael\u2019s lover Sara. Gretchen tells Lincoln that she has beheaded Sara, but lets LJ free in exchange for Whistler after the men escape.\n\nFOX Season four reveals that Michael and Lincoln's mother Christine is part of The Company\n\nSeason 4 Michael and Lincoln are recruited by Homeland security agent Don Self to recover a device named Syclla, which they believe contains information on The Company and could expose the conspiracy. Sara is found alive and well, but Bellick dies when he sacrifices himself to help the team. The brothers discover that Syclla is not The Company\u2019s address book, but instead contains plans for an advanced renewable power cell. Self is revealed to be a double agent who plans to sell Syclla to the highest bidder, and another Company agent named Christine is revealed to be Michael\u2019s mother \u2013 previously thought to be dead. Christine reveals that Lincoln was adopted, explaining the difference between their IQs. She attempts to shoot Michael, but is killed by Sara. The final scene takes place four years after Christine\u2019s death, which brought about the end of The Company. Sara, Lincoln and the other men have all been given immunity and are seen visiting Michael\u2019s grave.

        "body2": "Does Prison Break's Sara Really Believe Michael's Alive? Here's What Sarah Wayne Callies Says By Nick Venable Spoilers below for anyone who hasn't yet watched the season premiere of Prison Break's revival. For tonight's highly anticipated premiere, Fox's Prison Break could have stepped into its revival storyline any number of ways, considering one of its main characters needed to come back from what certainly looked like an inescapable death back in the last finale. Wisely, creator Paul Scheuring decided to turn this most intriguing aspect of the new season into a slow burn reveal, with both viewers and characters learning little from this limited reintroduction to Wentworth Miller's...Michael Scofield? Speaking with CinemaBlend, here's what actress Sarah Wayne Callies told me when I asked if Sara actually believes Michael is still alive. Well I mean, would you? He is [crafty], but he's also, as far as she knows, a loving and a loyal man, not a deadbeat dad. Not somebody who would leave her high and dry and pregnant, alone, just having broken out of prison. I think when she first sees that photo, to be honest --- because we were there, you know, we had a funeral, we buried him --- I think her first concern is Lincoln's being taken in by somebody who's dangerous. It's T-Bag. This is not a great guy. And this could send him down a rabbit hole that could end him. I think her first concern is for this brother-in-law that she loves so much, that's fallen out of her life because he's just kind of spiraling out of control. I think that that's her first concern. I can't imagine what it would be like to find out that the love of my life is still alive, seven years after I'd bid that painful farewell, so it's easy to understand that the first instinct is denial, followed quickly by a substitution of focus, combined with projecting. Of course she's going to call hogwash on Lincoln for bringing that picture to her without any other form of proof. Sara knows that Linc is not exactly famous for hanging out with the most honest and reputable people, her current self notwithstanding. As well, both of them know that Michael isn't a total monster, and in Sara's mind, only the most heinous of human beings could be capable of ditching a woman with child. But while Linc will just blindly dive into the conspiratorial belief system that comes along with mysterious photos in large envelopes, Sara doesn't feel quite so comfortable. Sara doesn't yet know the outcome of Linc and C-Note's trip to a Yemen prison to reconnect with Michael (a.k.a. Kaniel Outis), but the concept of Michael's survival will certainly be bouncing around in her head as she talks to her son and her new husband and is forced to rethink everything that's happened in the last seven years of her life. For any fans hoping to see the reconnection of a lifetime if and when Sara and Michael see each other again, Sarah Wayne Callies laughed as she hinted at how things will play out. To me that's the first question: 'Where the hell have you been? And why have I been raising a son that's never seen your face?' Yeah, this is not a candy, champagne and roses reunion. And look, I think it also throws into question: Did he ever love me? Was this all collateral damage to some other large plot that I was just a little pawn in. Because if he loved me, why didn't he stay with me? Why would you go? Michael's return to the world of Prison Break has different levels of interest, as we need to learn how in the world he survived that \"shocking\" form of sacrificing himself for Sara's escape, as well as what happened with the negative medical diagnosis he was dealing with. That's just covers the \"hows,\" too, since we also need to then work on why he would leave behind the people he's closest to, especially when one of them was pregnant. Then it's onto why it took this long for him to get back in touch with anybody, and what led him to Yemen, and so on and so on. And those answers will come...one day. Hopefully in a way that doesn't continue to disrupt Sara's life, too. If you're stumped as far as all things Michael-related are concerned, you're definitely not alone.

        "body1": "KINGSTON \u2014 An hour and a half before Tuesday's game, while his teammates were booting around a soccer ball, Niki Petti broke away from the group and walked over to the top of the corner stands.\n\nHe took a long look at the barn in Kingston. Fidgeted his hands a little.\n\n\"I wasn't thinking it was my last game, but the thought is always running through your head \u2014 this could be the last one, so embrace everything and remember it for as long as you can,\" he said.\n\nNearly five years ago, Petti played his first OHL game at the K Rock Centre. On Tuesday, he played his last. \"I have no emotion,\" he said. \"It doesn't seem real.\"\n\nAfter coming from behind to force Game 7, Petti's Hamilton Bulldogs gave up a two-goal lead to allow the Kingston Frontenacs to take their first round playoff series in overtime 3-2. Finnish rookie Linus Nyman scored the tying goal and the OT winner.\n\n\"I'm just so proud of our team,\" said Frontenacs head coach Paul McFarland. \"Our guys deserved it.\"\n\nThe game was heavy on defence to start, with Hamilton managing just four shots to Kingston's three in a scoreless first. Then, early in the second, it started to open up.\n\nThe Frontenacs had the first good chance of the game when the puck popped out to the near circle where Stephen Desrocher was stationed with a clear view of an open net. Jack Hanley, however, slid across the crease to keep his shot out of the mesh. Moments later, Petti found Matt Luff on a 2-on-1 the other way, but he rang the puck off the crossbar and out of play.\n\nWith about five minutes to go in the second, Luff got another opportunity when Ben Gleason fired a shot from the point that bounced off the backboards and onto his stick in the near circle. He buried it, and then, four minutes later, set up Michael Cramarossa across the crease to double the lead.\n\nBefore the end of the frame (and just 18 seconds after Cramarossa's goal) Kingston made it a one-goal game with Jason Robertson one-timing a Nyman feed from behind the net. Then, five minutes into the third, the Finn struck again, tying the game with a backhand from the goal line that snuck in over Dawson Carty's glove.\n\nThe Frontenacs had all the momentum after that, but the Bulldogs managed, somehow, to keep them off the board for the rest of the period. In OT, they even had a few good chances before Desrocher beat Connor Walters in a race to the puck in the neutral zone. He wired it off the post and it bounced to Robertson, who found Nyman in the near circle.\n\n\"What a series,\" said Bulldogs head coach John Gruden. \"It's unfortunate that one of these hardworking teams has to be done, but that's playoff hockey and I think my message is just for these guys back on this team to bottle it, understand it, feel it and be motivated.\n\n\"They never quit. We're proud of them and they're part of something special here that we want to build,\" he added.\n\nThe series was one of only two conference quarter-finals that stretched to seven games (London beat Memorial Cup hosts Windsor in the other) and marked Hamilton's return to the OHL playoffs after a 26-year absence. It was also the first time in six years a Bulldogs team in any league made it to the post-season.\n\nThe team, which missed out on home ice advantage by a point, took the first two games on the road before the Frontenacs replied with three straight wins. Then, trailing 2-1 and facing elimination, it exploded for three goals in five minutes to come back and take Game 6.\n\nOn top of Petti, Tuesday's game was also the last for Cramarossa and Carty, who are also graduating from the OHL this season. \"You feel the pain with them,\" Gruden said in the aftermath.\n\nOne of the top defensive teams in the league, the Frontenacs went into the series looking to contain Hamilton's offensive depth and firepower and with the exception of two periods \u2014 a five goal second in the second game and a four goal second in the sixth \u2014 executed the game plan perfectly. Over seven games, they held the Bulldogs to two or fewer goals five times and allowed just 2.7 goals per game \u2014 nearly a goal per game less than the 3.5 they scored in the regular season.\n\nHamilton did have success on special teams, though, capitalizing on more than one in every three chances on the power play and, going into Game 7, their formerly terrible penalty kill was second in the playoffs at an impressive 88 per cent.\n\nKingston will now head to Peterborough to face the Petes in the Eastern Conference semifinal. The Game 7 win was their first \u2014 ever \u2014 on home ice and third in 10 tries all time.", 
        "body0": "The London Knights celebrate after beating the Windsor Spitfires in Game 7, April 4, 2017. (Photo courtesy of Steve Stax)\n\nKnights Eliminate Spitfires In Nail Biting Game 7\n\nThe London Knights scored a 3-2 victory over the Spitfires in Tuesday\u2019s Game 7 to eliminate Windsor from the OHL playoffs.\n\nAfter a scoreless first period, Janne Kuokkanen put London on the board with a goal 3:55 into the second. Max Jones followed by scoring just 12:04 into the period to give the Knights a 2-0 lead heading into the third.\n\nWindsor made it on the board early in the final frame thanks to a goal by Jeremy Bracco, and Aaron Luchuk scored for the Spits to tie the game with just over ten minutes left.\n\nHowever, Olli Juolevi scored the game winner for the Knights in the second half of the period. London kept Windsor at bay in the final minutes to ensure the win.\n\nThe Knights outshot the Spitfires 32-26.\n\nLondon will now move on to the second round of the playoffs to take on the Erie Otters. Game 1 is set for Thursday at 7pm in Erie.", 
        "body2": "It was as portentous an omen as there could have been.\n\nMinutes before the start of the official pre-game ceremonies for Game 7 of the Western Hockey League Eastern Conference quarter-final between the Swift Current Broncos and Moose Jaw Warriors, a sudden power fluctuation knocked out the Mosaic Place scoreboard and sound system. When the power came back on, half the scoreboard and two speaker banks were inoperable.\n\nIn other words, part of the very arena itself wasn\u2019t going to be at it\u2019s best for Game 7.\n\nIt ended up being a metaphor for the Moose Jaw Warriors themselves.\n\nThe Broncos opened scoring early in the first period and never trailed in the deciding game of the epic back-and-forth series, taking a 3-2 victory over a Warriors side that coach Tim Hunter felt never truly hit their stride.\n\n\u201cTheir team had a bigger will in front of their net and in front of our net, their best players Steenbergen, Gawdin, Pederson, Heponiemi, Lindgren \u2026 they played better than our best players,\u201d Hunter said outside a somber Warriors dressing room as the Broncos\u2019 raucous celebration echoed through the halls. \u201cWe were still trying to get guys going in Game 7 in our top forward group and that\u2019s the disappointing part of it. They deserved to win the series because they played harder at both ends of the ice than we did on a more consistent basis, and that\u2019s how you win a playoff series.\u201d\n\nColby Sissons, Tyler Steenbergen and Glenn Gawdin scored for Swift Current as they led 1-0 after the first and 2-1 through two.\n\nJustin Almeida and Josh Brook scored for the Warriors, who also had a goal disallowed in the third period.\n\nJordan Papirny turned in yet another solid performance in the Broncos goal, turning aside 39 shots, while Warriors goaltender Zach Sawchenko was equally as impressive while making 27 saves in the Warriors net.\n\nThe Game 7 was the first to ever be played in Moose Jaw and concluded a series that ended up with the two teams only managing a single win at home each.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re just happy to have an opportunity to win and we were fortunate enough to win this series against a very good hockey team,\u201d said Broncos coach Manny Viveiros. \u201cIt could have gone either way, right down to the very end and it\u2019s too bad someone has to lose in a series like this, but we\u2019re okay with winning also.\u201d\n\nSee Wednesday\u2019s Times-Herald for more.",
