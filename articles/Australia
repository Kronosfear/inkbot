        "Have you ever forgotten someone's name the moment after you were introduced?\n\nU.S. Press Secretary Sean Spicer appears to have done just that, after getting Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's name wrong at the daily White House press briefing on Tuesday.\n\n\"The president had an incredibly productive set of meetings and discussions with Prime Minister Joe Trudeau of Canada,\" Spicer said at the beginning of the press briefing.\n\nSpicer appeared to be reading from a prepared statement, before facing a barrage of questions over the resignation of national security adviser Michael Flynn.\n\nWATCH: .@PressSec refers to Prime Minister @JustinTrudeau as \"Joe Trudeau.\" pic.twitter.com/GOL7zR3gMn — Michel Boyer (@BoyerMichel) February 14, 2017\n\nWhile reporters grilled Spicer over Flynn's connections to Russia, Twitter users had a laugh at the possibility of another, \"regular Joe\" member of the Trudeau family.\n\nJoe Trudeau in the running for most Canadian sounding name of all time. — Domeward Bound (@domewardbound) February 14, 2017\n\n.@JustinTrudeau Is Joe Trudeau your equally good looking and extremely single twin? If so, hook me up. — Pie From Apples (@lechatsavant) February 14, 2017\n\nJoe Trudeau? Sean Spicer just can't get it right man — Asha Ali (@ashaalis) February 14, 2017\n\nJoe Trudeau is Justin's older, more handsome twin brother. He's single too. Spicer can hook you up, just shoot him a text with ur info. — Molly Wilbanks (@mollsyanna) February 14, 2017\n\nJoe Trudeau seems like a guy I'd like to have a pint with, maybe share some nachos. — Sabrina Furminger (@sabrinarmf) February 14, 2017\n\nTrudeau was in Washington on Monday for his first meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump.\n\nLast month, the White House spelled U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May's name wrong, referring to her instead as Teresa May, a former adult film actress.", 
        "Just your average Joe Trudeau\n\nAnother day, another stumble from White House press secretary Sean Spicer in pronouncing a world leader’s name. After appearing to call Australian PM Malcolm Turnbull “Malcolm Trumble”—twice—Spicer made note of Monday’s much-hyped first meeting between Donald Trump and Justin Trudeau in his briefing, but managed to call Trudeau “Joe.” Perhaps he just hadn’t had his morning cup of Justin yet.\n\nHe says, she says, Flynn goes\n\nMichael Flynn is finally out as national security advisor after misleading White House officials over conversations with Russian officials. Press secretary Sean Spicer said the president asked for Flynn’s resignation; Trump’s advisor Kellyanne Conway said it was Flynn’s decision. Alternative facts?\n\nThe invitation stands\n\nNearly two million people signed an online petition to un-invite Trump from a state visit to the United Kingdom, but it’s all for naught. British officials have rejected the proposal, which means—oh yes—Donald J. Trump might soon get a meeting with Her Majesty the Queen.\n\nAbout that tax return\n\nLong after Trump won the election, Democrats are still trying to force him to release his tax returns. The latest attempt involved a little-known law and efforts to frame it as a national security issue, but that was quickly blocked by House Republicans. Maybe that audit will be done come re-election time.\n\nDeclined transaction\n\nThe U.S. ethics office said Kellyanne Conway made a “clear violation” when she urged Fox & Friends viewers to go online and shop for Ivanka Trump’s fashion label. The office’s director urged the White House to consider disciplinary actions. Trump disciplining Conway for supporting Ivanka? Good luck with that.\n\nDown the drain\n\nAfter a decade of legal battles to get his own name trademarked in China—as products from pacemakers to condoms without any affiliation to Trump get produced and sold in the country—Trump appeared in line for a huge victory on Tuesday. The losers? Anyone who dreams of flushing Trump-branded condoms down a Trump-branded toilet, with none of their profits going to the president. (Editor’s note: condoms should not be flushed down toilets, as they can cause serious damage to your septic tank.)",

        "What's better than scoring one goal against Barcelona in the Champions League on your birthday? Bagging a double.\n\nAngel Di Maria scored his second to give PSG a 3-0 lead on Barca in the round of 16 first leg on Tuesday, curling a gorgeous effort into the upper corner. After his free kick made it 1-0, Di Maria outdid himself on his birthday by scoring this beauty.\n\nGame over, possibly the tie. Di Maria with another beautiful goal to make it 3-0!! #PSGFCB ⚽ ... pic.twitter.com/cpfBb9B95v — Ali (@ChocMilkSheikh1) February 14, 2017\n\nAnd that gave the French side a dominant lead against one of the top contenders for the crown. A birthday to remember.", 
        "The Argentine has been a decisive influence at the very top level before, and with Barcelona looming it seems he has rediscovered his motivation\n\nWhen Real Madrid won La Decima in 2014, the influence of Angel Di Maria was hailed as one of the major factors that allowed the Bernabeu side to create history. Named man of the match on the historic occasion they defeated city rivals Atletico, he was not to linger long in Spain, with a British record move to Manchester United following in August.\n\nDi Maria’s spell at Old Trafford, though, was troubled. He never settled under Louis van Gaal, and having been used in a variety of positions was one of the high-profile casualties of what proved to be a thoroughly miserable campaign.\n\n“He is one of the players who are in a row of players who have no self-criticism,” the Dutchman later stated, having been accused by his former charge of moving him around too much.\n\nSeeking gamebreakers to lift them to an elite level, Paris Saint-Germain were quick to pounce for the former Rosario and Benfica man, splashing out £44 million on a player United had paid nearly £60m for 12 months earlier.\n\nAfter making a bright start in France, he has endured a difficult second campaign and is only now beginning to get going again.\n\nA spectacular performance off the bench in Monaco on his PSG debut set the bar high. Given just 24 minutes to impress, he produced one fine assist and showed the kind of silky touches that had ultimately won him acclaim in Spain.\n\nEven if the rest of the season did not live up to that standard, it could be considered relatively strong. No-one could touch him when it came to setting up goals in Ligue 1 – he created 18 in total, five more than his nearest rival and club-mate Zlatan Ibrahimovic. Additionally, he supplied two decisive passes as Chelsea were seen off in the Champions League last 16.\n\nNot necessarily signed as a goal scorer, he would contribute an impressive 15 times on that front.\n\nPSG could have struggled to ask for more as they claimed the domestic treble, with Di Maria performing well in a strong supporting cast around the Swede. This season, however, has been a different story.\n\nWith Ibrahimovic having left for the patch of Manchester that he found impossible win over, the 28-year-old was expected to step forward to become one of the stars of the team. Expectations heightened that he could contribute his regular scoring while maintaining his prolific rate of creating for others.\n\n'I have to score 100 goals before I can go' - Ibrahimovic\n\nUntil the last fortnight, that simply has not been the case.\n\nThe first half of the campaign finished with Di Maria having scored just three goals, including only one in the league, and having created seven more – well down on his pace the previous year. He seemed to be slipping into the void that Zlatan left rather than filling it.\n\nIndeed, it was not until Julian Draxler arrived shortly after Christmas and threatened to take his place that the real Di Maria came to play.\n\nHead coach Unai Emery took the bold step of omitting him from his starting XI under the cover of squad rotation. In reality, it was an admission that Lucas Moura, himself a much-improved figure, and January signing Draxler had overtaken him in the pecking order.\n\nThe German’s arrival in Paris seems to have lit a fire under his rival, which bodes well for the conclusion to the campaign – both at home and abroad.\n\nRonaldinho: PSG can test Barcelona\n\nHaving been alerted to the scale of his problems at PSG, Di Maria is threatening to rediscover the form that made him invaluable to Real Madrid in their clutch moments at the end of 2013-14. He was his side’s best player in the 2-1 win over Lille, and last Friday in Bordeaux, he both scored and created another.\n\nThomas Meunier is clear why there has been a sharp improvement from his South American cohort.\n\n“The competition,” the Belgian explained after the 3-0 success at Stade Matmut Atlantique at the weekend. “Everyone knows that places are expensive, that from one week to the next you could be on the bench or on the field.\n\n“If we want to have a chance to play games, we have to really work at training and in the games, to show we’re capable – and that’s what happened.\n\n“Draxler is a very, very good player, and everyone understands that. Angel, quite simply, he doesn’t want to be a substitute. He’s been metamorphosed. He is just putting a little more in.”\n\nDi Maria, it seems, is starting to show the fight that he was accused of lacking in Manchester, but how long he is prepared to show this level of motivation for is a question that can only be answered by time.\n\nCarlo Ancelotti, the man who, as Madrid boss, saw the best of the player during his blistering spell in the first half of 2014, did not exactly give him a rousing reference when he told Eurosport : \"Some players love to compete, others prefer to make more money. If a player needs motivation to play at the best club in the world, I have no problem in letting him go.\"\n\nNevertheless, the Bayern Munich boss would later praise the player for his unique ability to \"take matches by storm with his energy\". That, however, requires motivation, and that, it seems, it Di Maria's weakness.\n\nIf he is to re-emerge as a star capable of carrying PSG to the very top, as he did with Madrid, Tuesday’s Champions League meeting with Barcelona would be a great place to start - and if he needs any extra incentive to shine upon such a great stage, then his best days really are behind him.",

        "Paris Saint-Germain’s Ángel Di María was at his vintage best as he scored twice on his birthday in a 4-0 demolition of Barcelona in their Champions League last 16 first leg. The Argentina winger, 29, scored in each half, with PSG’s Germany midfielder Julian Draxler and the Uruguay striker Edinson Cavani also finding the net as the French champions tore apart a disorganised Barcelona side who have it all to do in the return leg.\n\nPSG, eliminated by Barcelona in the Champions League quarter-finals in 2013 and 2015, were the more aggressive side at the Parc des Princes and have put themselves in a commanding position before the 8 March second leg at the Camp Nou. The five-time European champions Barcelona have not gone out in the last 16 since losing to Liverpool in the 2006‑07 season.\n\nThe only downside for PSG coach Unai Emery was the loss of the impressive Marco Verratti to a leg injury in the second half after a brilliant display from the Italy international and his fellow midfielder Adrien Rabiot in the first half. PSG were dangerous on the break and came close to scoring in the 11th minute when the captain Blaise Matuidi’s rasping shot was parried by Barcelona goalkeeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen after a perfect through ball from Rabiot.\n\nThe home side were rewarded seven minutes later when Di Maria whipped a free kick over the Barcelona wall into the net. Barcelona continued to play their patient possession game but failed to threaten, and their complacency was punished again five minutes before the break. Lionel Messi lost the ball in midfield and Verratti slid a perfectly weighted ball to the right for Draxler, who fired a low shot into the far bottom corner of the net.\n\nPSG started the second half strongly and went further ahead in the 55th minute when Di Maria danced around Andres Iniesta before curling a shot past Ter Stegen from 25 yards. Verratti limped off the pitch in some discomfort after 71 minutes, and was replaced by Chris Nkunku.\n\nPSG continued to push forward, however, and a minute later Cavani, who was celebrating his 30th birthday, rifled a low shot past Ter Stegen for his seventh goal in seven games in the competition this season. The hosts also defended perfectly, with centre back Presnel Kimpembe putting in a superb performance on his Champions League debut in the place of PSG’s injured captain Thiago Silva.\n\nBarcelona had a chance to get an away goal seven minutes from time but Samuel Umtiti’s header hit Kevin Trapp’s right-hand post, leaving Luis Enrique’s side with a mountain to climb. No team have ever overturned a deficit of four or more goals to progress in the Champions league knockout stages.",

Malaysian police said a North Korean had been taken sick at Kuala Lumpur International Airport and since died.\n\nA senior security source told Al Jazeera that Malaysian police \"strongly\" believe the deceased individual was Kim Jong-nam.\n\nOPINION: North Korea cements Kim Jong-un at the top\n\nIn a statement, Malaysian police said the 46-year-old dead man was travelling on a passport under the name Kim Chol.\n\n\"Kim Jong-nam has been known to travel using a fake name,\" Al Jazeera's Florence Looi, reporting from the airport in Kuala Lumpur, said.\n\nShe added that the body of the deceased man had been taken to a hospital where an autopsy was being conducted.\n\nEarlier on Tuesday, the Yonhap news agency said Kim Jong-nam was killed on Monday morning in Malaysia. It cited a South Korean government source but gave no more details.\n\nTV Chosun, a cable television network, said separately that Kim Jong-nam was poisoned at Kuala Lumpur airport by two women believed to be North Korean operatives, who were at large, citing multiple South Korean government sources.\n\nKim Jong-nam and Kim Jong-un are both sons of former leader Kim Jong-il, who died in late 2011, but they had different mothers.\n\nIn 2001, Kim Jong-nam was caught at an airport in Japan travelling on a fake passport, saying he had wanted to visit Tokyo Disneyland.\n\nHe was known to spend a significant amount of his time outside North Korea, travelling to Hong Kong, Macau and mainland China.\n\nHe said several times over the years that he had no interest in leading his country.\n\n\"Personally, I am against third-generation succession,\" he told Japan's Asahi TV in 2010, before his younger brother had succeeded their father.\n\n\"I hope my younger brother will do his best for the sake of North Koreans' prosperous lives.\"\n\nINFOGRAPHIC: What is the reach of North Korea's missiles?\n\nMalaysia is one of a dwindling number of countries that has close relations with North Korea, which is under tightening global sanctions over its nuclear tests and ballistic missile launches, the latest of which took place on Sunday.\n\nMalaysians and North Koreans can visit each other's country without visas.\n\nSource: Al Jazeera and news agencies", 
        "Kim Jong-Un's playboy half-brother has been killed by two female assassins who attacked him from behind with poison at an airport in Malaysia, it has emerged.\n\nKim Jong-nam, the eldest son of former North Korean dictator Kim Jong-il, died on his way to hospital after collapsing at Kuala Lumpur airport while waiting for a flight to Macau on Monday.\n\nThe 45-year-old is believed to have been targeted by North Korean operatives who are still at large amid reports they attacked him either with poisoned needles or toxic spray.\n\nEyewitnesses say he asked for help at an airport information point before being rushed to a medical clinic in the terminal. The two attackers hailed a cab and fled.\n\nThere is already speculation that the assassination was ordered by his estranged brother, North Korean tyrant Kim Jong-Un.\n\nJong-nam was known to spend a significant amount of his time outside the country and had spoken out publicly against his family's dynastic control of the isolated state.\n\nScroll down for video\n\nKim Jong-nam (pictured), the 45-year-old oldest son of Kim Jong-il, has been killed in Malaysia, according to reports in the country\n\nHospital security personnel block the entrance of the Forensic department at the hospital, in Putrajaya. Malaysian police have confirmed Kim Jong-Nam died en route to hospital from a Kuala Lumpur airport\n\nReports, citing multiple government sources, said two women hailed a cab and fled immediately after Jong-nam fell sick\n\nMalaysian police have confirmed the dead North Korean man is Kim Jong-Nam and that he was waiting for a flight with a passport under the name of Kim Chol. He has been caught in the past using forged travel documents.\n\nPolice official Fadzil Ahmat said that the cause of Kim's death had not been determined yet, but that a post mortem would be carried out on the body.\n\n'So far there are no suspects, but we have started investigations and are looking at a few possibilities to get leads,' Fadzil told Reuters.\n\nAccording to Fadzil, Kim had been planning to fly out on Monday when he fell ill at the low-cost terminal of the international airport.\n\n'The deceased ... felt like someone grabbed or held his face from behind,' Fadzil said. 'He felt dizzy, so he asked for help at the ... counter of KLIA.'\n\nKim was taken to an airport clinic where he still felt unwell, and it was decided to take him to hospital. He died in the ambulance on the way to Putrajaya Hospital, Fadzil added.\n\nSouth Korea's TV Chosun, a cable television network, reported that Kim had been poisoned with a needle by two women believed to be North Korean operatives who fled in a taxi and were at large, citing multiple South Korean government sources.\n\nThe playboy half-brother of Kim Jong-Un (pictured, centre) was killed by two female assassins with poisoned needles at an airport in Malaysia, it has been claimed\n\nKim Jong-nam (right as a boy), the oldest son of former North Korean dictator Kim Jong-il (left), died on his way to hospital after collapsing at Kuala Lumpur airport\n\nKim Jong-nam is the son of Kim Jong-il's first mistress Song Hye-rim (pictured)\n\n'We don't know if there was a cloth or needles; the receptionist said someone grabbed his face, he felt dizzy,' police official Fadzil said, when asked about the nature of the reported attack.\n\nSouth Korea's national news agency Yonhap quoted a source as saying agents of the North's spy agency, the Reconnaissance General Bureau, carried out the assassination on Monday by taking advantage of a security loophole between Jong-Nam's bodyguards and Malaysian police at the airport.\n\nMalaysia is one of a dwindling number of countries that has close relations with North Korea. Malaysians and North Koreans can visit each other's country without visas.\n\nCheong Seong-Jang, senior researcher at Seoul's Sejong Institute think-tank, said Jong-Nam had been living in near-exile so it was unlikely that Jong-Un saw him as a potential competitor for power.\n\n'But if Jong-Nam committed an act to damage Jong-Un's authority, I think it's possible that the Reconnaissance General Bureau may have directly conducted the assassination under the orders of Jong-Un since it has been in charge of closely watching Jong-Nam.'\n\nKim Jong-Nam was once considered heir apparent but caused embarrassment to his father Kim Jong-Il following a botched attempt in 2001 to enter Japan on a forged passport and visit Disneyland using a Chinese alias, Pang Xiong, which means 'fat bear' in Mandarin Chinese.\n\nHe reportedly feared for his life after falling out of favour with Pyongyang and has since lived in virtual exile, mainly in the Chinese territory of Macau.\n\nMalaysian journalists gather outside the Forensics department at Putrajaya Hospital in Putrajaya, where the body of Kim Jong-Nam is believed to be kept\n\nKim Jong-Un took over as North Korean leader when his father died in December 2011. Jong-Nam did not attend his father's funeral.\n\nThe dictator has been trying to strengthen his grip on power in the face of growing international pressure over North Korea's nuclear and missile programmes.\n\nThe latest launch of a new intermediate-range missile on Sunday brought UN Security Council condemnation and vows of a strong response from US President Donald Trump.\n\nKim Jong-Nam, known as an advocate of reform in the North, once told a Japanese newspaper that he opposed his country's dynastic power transfers.\n\n'LITTLE GENERAL' WHO FELL OUT OF FAVOUR WITH PYONGYANG They used to call him the 'Little General' but Kim Jong-Nam - once heir-apparent to his father and North Korea's then-leader Kim Jong-Il - fell from grace in 2001 after a spectacular blunder. On Tuesday, after more than a decade in exile from the North, Jong-Nam - the 45-year-old half-brother of current leader Kim Jong-Un - was widely reported by South Korean media to have been assassinated in Malaysia. Born from his father's relationship with actress Sung Hae-rim, Jong-Nam is known to have been a computer enthusiast, a fluent Japanese speaker and a student in both Russia and Switzerland. He lived in Pyongyang after finishing his overseas studies and was put in charge of overseeing North Korea's information technology policy. But the chubby eldest son of the supreme leader was already seen by Seoul experts as something of a political lightweight when in 2001 he fell out of favour. Jong-nam (pictured) was reportedly close to his uncle Jang Song-Thaek, once the North's unofficial number two and political mentor of the current leader He was embarrassingly detained at a Tokyo airport, trying to enter Japan to visit Disneyland on a false Dominican Republic passport, accompanied by two women and a child. Jong-Nam and his family afterwards lived in virtual exile in Macau, Singapore and China. Jong-Nam's half-brother Jong-Un took over as North Korean leader when their father died in December 2011. In an email exchange with a Japanese journalist published in 2012, Jong-Nam spoke disparagingly of Jong-Un, saying he lacked 'any sense of duty or seriousness' and warned that bribery and corruption would lead to North Korea's eventual collapse. In another exchange with the same reporter in 2012, Jong-Nam said: 'Anyone with normal thinking would find it difficult to tolerate three generations of hereditary succession.' Kim Jong-Nam was once dubbed the 'Little General', but fell out of favour with his father In October 2012 South Korean prosecutors said a North Korean detained as a spy had admitted involvement in a plot to stage a hit-and-run car accident in China in 2010 targeting Jong-Nam. In 2014 Jong-Nam was reported to be in Indonesia - sighted at an Italian restaurant run by a Japanese businessman in Jakarta - and was said to be shuttling back and forth between Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia and France. In 2012 a Moscow newspaper reported that Jong-Nam was having financial problems after being cut off by the Stalinist state for doubting its succession policy. The Argumenty i Fakty weekly said he was kicked out of a luxury hotel in Macau over a $15,000 debt. Jong-Nam's son Kim Han-Sol studied at university in Paris. Back in 2012, when at school in Bosnia, he labelled his uncle Kim Jong-Un a 'dictator' in an interview. 'My dad (Jong-Nam) was not really interested in politics,' Kim told the interviewer when asked why his father was passed over for the dynastic succession in favour of his younger brother.\n\nIn an email exchange with a Japanese journalist published in 2012, Jong-Nam spoke disparagingly of Jong-Un, saying he lacked 'any sense of duty or seriousness' and warned that bribery and corruption would lead to North Korea's eventual collapse.\n\nIn another exchange with the same reporter in 2012, Jong-Nam said: 'Anyone with normal thinking would find it difficult to tolerate three generations of hereditary succession.'\n\nBut he said several times over the years that he had no interest in leading his country.\n\nKim Jong-Nam was once considered heir apparent but fell out of favour with his father Kim Jong-Il following a botched attempt in 2001 to enter Japan on a forged passport and visit Disneyland\n\nKim Jong-Nam has since lived in virtual exile, mainly in the Chinese territory of Macau\n\n'Personally I am against third-generation succession,' he told Japan's Asahi TV in 2010, before his younger had succeeded their father.\n\n'I hope my younger brother will do his best for the sake of North Koreans' prosperous lives.'\n\nIf confirmed, Jong-nam's case would be the highest-profile death under the Kim Jong-Un regime since the execution of the leader's uncle Jang Song-Thaek in December 2013.\n\nBorn to Kim Jong-il's first mistress Song Hye-rim, he was persecuted by his father as he feared he could be a threat to the succession he had planned for Kim Jong-un.\n\nHIGH-PROFILE POISON ATTACKS After the assassination of Kim Jong-Un's half-brother, here are some previous high-profile poison attacks, fatal and otherwise. Poison umbrella kills Bulgarian - September 1978: Georgy Markov, a Bulgarian dissident living in exile in London, is stabbed with a ricin poison-tipped umbrella as he is going home from his job with BBC World Service radio. He dies four days later. Hamas leader survives coma - September 1997: Israeli agents working in Jordan administer poison to the leader of the Palestinian group Hamas, Khaled Meshaal, who is living there. But the agents are captured and in order to obtain their release Israel is forced to provide an antidote. Meshaal survives after falling into a coma. Dioxin scars Ukraine's Yushchenko - September 2004: Ukrainian politician Viktor Yushchenko, campaigning against Russian-backed candidate Viktor Yanukovych for his country's presidency, is diagnosed with dioxin poisoning which disfigures his face. His supporters accuse the Russian secret service of being behind the incident. Yushchenko goes on to win the election. Arafat poison charges dismissed - November 2004: Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat dies in a French military hospital. French experts are unable say what had killed him, fueling accusations that he was poisoned by Israel. After a murder probe French prosecutors dismiss claims he was poisoned, after Swiss experts said they found high levels of radioactive polonium on his personal effects. Indonesian Munir's arsenic death - September 2004: Indonesian human rights campaigner Munir Said Thalib dies of arsenic poisoning after a flight from Jakarta to Amsterdam. A pilot is convicted of killing him on behalf of his country's intelligence services, but in October 2006 the sentence is quashed by the Indonesian Supreme Court. Polonium kills ex-spy Litvinenko - November 2006: Former Russian spy Alexander Litvinenko dies in agony after drinking tea laced with highly radioactive Polonium-210 at a London hotel, in a case which plunged Moscow-London relations into a deep chill.\n\nIn 2014 it was reported that he was aware that his life was in constant danger because he criticised the Kim Jong-Un regime.\n\nAnother source claimed at the time that a North Korean agent had tried to assassinate Kim Jong-nam in Macau in 2011, but failed after a bloody shootout with his bodyguards. He fled to another city.\n\nThere was even speculation that Beijing was watching Kim Jong-nam's back for him, with a pencilled-in plan to install him as leader of North Korea should the regime of Kim Jong-un collapse.\n\nHe was reportedly close to his uncle Jang Song-Thaek, once the North's unofficial number two and political mentor of the current leader.\n\nIn October 2012 South Korean prosecutors said a North Korean detained as a spy had admitted involvement in a plot to stage a hit-and-run car accident in China in 2010 targeting Jong-Nam.\n\nThree years ago he was reported to be in Indonesia - sighted at an Italian restaurant run by a Japanese businessman in Jakarta - and was said to be shuttling back and forth between Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia and France.\n\nIn 2014 it was reported that Jong-nam was aware that his life was in constant danger because he criticised King Jong-Un (pictured)\n\nFormer North Korean leader Kim Jong Il (bottom left) poses with his first-born son Kim Jong Nam (bottom right), in this 1981 family photo in Pyongyang, North Korea\n\nIn 2012 a Moscow newspaper reported that Jong-Nam was having financial problems after being cut off by the Stalinist state for doubting its succession policy.\n\nThe Argumenty i Fakty weekly said he was kicked out of a luxury hotel in Macau over a $15,000 debt.\n\nLast year South Korea warned of possible North Korean assassination attempts on its territory. It noted previous attempts to assassinate Hwang Jang-Yop, the North's chief ideologue and former tutor to Kim Jong-Il, who defected to the South in 1997 and died of natural causes in 2010.\n\nHowever, in 2015 it was reported that Kim Jong-Un had given his illegitimate half-brother a job in North Korea's foreign ministry.\n\nKim Jong-nam was said to have been given work in the division that handles issues involving Japan and even went to a Japanese school.",

        "Fall of Singapore anniversary: How a military defeat changed Australia\n\nPosted\n\nThe Australia-US relationship has had its challenges of late, with the decades-old alliance potentially at risk after THAT phone call between Donald Trump and Malcolm Turnbull.\n\nBut an important national commemoration this week will provide a reminder of how the two countries forged their lasting partnership in the first place.\n\nFebruary 15 marks the 75th anniversary of the fall of Singapore in World War II. It also effectively marks the rise of the US-Australia strategic relationship. More on that later.\n\nWhat was the lead-up?\n\nLet us first go back to the dark days of January 1942. The Pacific War is weeks old and the Imperial Japanese Army is on the move.\n\nHaving launched their attack on Thailand and Malaya on the same day as Pearl Harbour, Japanese forces are steadily fighting their way towards the big British naval base in Singapore.\n\nStanding in their way is a collection of battle-weary British, Australian and Indian troops. They were to stand no chance against a decisive and well-organised enemy.\n\nAlmost 700 Australian troops were killed in the intense fighting on the Malayan peninsula. On January 31, the allied forces withdrew across the causeway linking Malaya and Singapore.\n\nThe battle for Singapore was about to begin.\n\nWhat happened at Singapore?\n\nThe British Army was convinced the Japanese assault would come from the sea, to the south of the island, and had fortified its coastal defences accordingly.\n\nIt was to be fatal miscalculation. On February 8, Japanese forces streamed in to Singapore across the narrow Straits of Jahore, on the island's north-west.\n\nThe Australian defenders were spread too thinly and were quickly forced back by wave after wave of Japanese invaders.\n\nBy February 13, the allied perimeter had shrunk to a 40km line around Singapore City itself. Water supplies were running low and the city's one million residents were suffering constant Japanese bombardment.\n\nLate in the day on February 15, 1942, with no options left, British commander Lieutenant-General Arthur Percival raised the white flag.\n\nControversially, the Australian commander, Lieutenant-General Gordon Bennett, escaped Singapore by boat on the night of the surrender and eventually returned home.\n\nBritain's wartime prime minister, Winston Churchill, called the fall of Singapore \"the worst disaster and the greatest capitulation in British history\".\n\nBut for the 130,000 allied troops taken prisoner, including 15,000 Australians, there was worse to come. Much worse.\n\nWhat happened to the prisoners?\n\nThey were to spend the rest of the war enduring starvation and brutality as POWs.\n\nIn the days after the surrender the prisoners were marched across the city to Singapore's notorious Changi camp. Later, the emaciated captives were farmed out to labour camps across Asia, notably the hellish Thai-Burma railway.\n\nIn the words of one POW, the railway construction looked like a scene from Dante's Inferno. POWs were also sent to Japan itself.\n\nThe war years were also to prove an ordeal for the POW's families back in Australia, most of whom had no idea whether their loved ones would survive.\n\nOf the 22,000 Australians taken prisoner by the Japanese in WWII, 8,000 never came home. Those who did would bear physical and mental scars for the rest of their lives.\n\nHow could such a loss occur?\n\nFor decades after the war there was finger-pointing galore over just who was to blame for the fall of Singapore.\n\nWas it poor British defence planning? Or flawed battle strategy on the ground? Or was it simply the Japanese were too strong?\n\nIn early 1993, a British wartime report surfaced, blaming the catastrophic defeat on indisciplined and cowardly Australian soldiers.\n\nIn a furious retort, then prime minister Paul Keating said the claims were \"beyond the bounds of decency and credibility\", and made it clear Britain itself was responsible for \"its most humiliating debacle\".\n\nIn an earlier parliamentary assault, Mr Keating described Britain as \"a country which decided not to defend the Malayan peninsula, not to worry about Singapore and not to give us our troops back to keep ourselves free of Japanese domination\".\n\nWhat was the political fallout?\n\nThe fall of Singapore, commemorated each year by an ever-dwindling number of survivors, effectively marked the point when Australia reconsidered its colonial relationship with Britain and looked increasingly towards the US for its future protection.\n\nJust weeks earlier, in his new year's address for 1942, prime minister John Curtin pointed to this shifting allegiance:\n\n\"Without any inhibitions of any kind, I make it clear that Australia looks to America, free of any pangs to our traditional links or kinship with the United Kingdom.\"\n\nAustralia was looking even harder in America's direction when, just four days after the Singapore surrender, Japanese war planes bombed Darwin. The threat of invasion was suddenly very real.\n\nThe fall of Singapore was a military defeat that ushered in years of horror for Australian prisoners of war.\n\nIt was also a capitulation with profound strategic consequences.\n\nTopics: world-war-2, unrest-conflict-and-war, singapore, australia", 
        "Fall of Singapore at 75: Garden of the Grieving Mother memorial to be unveiled in Ballarat\n\nPosted\n\nThe collective grief of thousands of mothers who lost sons and daughters to war is to be recognised in a new Ballarat memorial to be unveiled on Wednesday, the 75th anniversary of the fall of Singapore.\n\nMore than 20,000 Australians served in the Malayan campaign, with about 1,800 lives lost in battle.\n\nAbout 15,000 were captured as prisoners of war, the majority in the fall of Singapore on February 15, 1942.\n\nThe Garden of the Grieving Mother, a $500,000 garden project that completes Ballarat's Arch of Victory precinct, is an acknowledgement of the trauma, grief and anxiety felt by the families of Australian servicemen and women.\n\nAt its centre is a 1.8 metre bronze sculpture of a mother clutching a photograph of her son.\n\nGarden of the Grieving Mother sub-committee chairman Garry Snowden hopes the garden will serve as a permanent reminder of the broader impact of war.\n\n\"During times of war there is an enormous amount of uncertainty and anxiety and grief being experienced back home,\" he said.\n\n\"I hope it will stand as reminder to current and future generations of the inevitable consequences of war.\n\n\"I hope that in some way that might guide the wisdom of our future leaders, and maybe enable them to resolve disputes and differences without having to send young men and women to war.\"\n\nThe garden is designed to balance the adjacent Avenue of Honour, the longest commemorative avenue in Australia.\n\nSculpture about love\n\nAnnette Calvert's great grandmother Isabella Moore was among 42 Ballarat mothers to experience the crushing loss of two sons.\n\nThe Moore twins, Ina — Ms Calvert's grandfather — and Clement, were killed on the same day in France in July 1916.\n\n\"I just can't imagine what that would have been like for her,\" Ms Calvert said.\n\n\"For my grandmother to be left a widow at a time when there wasn't the social benefits and assistance there is today, I can understand now just how tough and resilient she was.\"\n\nFor sculptor Peter Corlett, his creation is about love.\n\n\"It is about enduring love, love that goes on beyond the grave, beyond the loss of a loved one,\" he said.\n\n\"That is one of the reasons I've made the woman an older woman, to give it a sense of duration.\n\n\"My wife saw it recently at the foundry and it made her cry, which is probably the right sort of response.\"\n\nThe statue is not based on a particular individual, but is based on a letter from a particular grieving mother written to Australian authorities in 1919.\n\n\"The Grieving Mother is all grieving mothers,\" Mr Corlett said.\n\nMs Calvert believes it is important to pay tribute to the families left behind.\n\n\"I think people in general don't realise the impact of the loss of a father on the generations that follow,\" she said.\n\n\"Because my granddad died, my father's life changed dramatically. It was a difficult life for him.\n\n\"I think this garden is a beautiful thing to recognise the pain and suffering that these people went through.\"\n\nTopics: defence-forces, defence-and-national-security, veterans, world-war-1, world-war-2, history, ballarat-3350, singapore, france",

        "1. On Valentine’s Day, you go to the mall and buy a skirt for your girlfriend and a “Doctor Who” Lego set for yourself. If the skirt cost fifty dollars, the Lego set cost seventy-eight dollars and fifty cents, and you’re thirty-four years old and don’t have health insurance, does that really justify your girlfriend staying up all night texting her ex after you’ve fallen asleep?\n\n2. There are ninety-nine people inside a given bar on Valentine’s Day. If thirty-three people report that they are very happy in their current relationships, thirty-three people report that they’re actively looking for new relationships, and thirty-three people report that they’re happy being single, are the two-thirds of the people who are lying aware that they’re doing it, or are they completely deluded?\n\n3. A local pizzeria is offering one large pizza for eleven dollars and seventy-five cents on Valentine’s Day. If you have forty-six dollars in your checking account, it takes you twenty-five minutes to eat a large pizza all by yourself, and your only plan for the evening is to spend ninety minutes scrolling through the Instagram account of a woman you had a crush on in high school for clues that her marriage might be faltering, how did it come to this?\n\n4. Tony has three “friends with benefits.” Two of these three women are anxious for Tony to spend Valentine’s Day with them, but the third woman is the only one Tony can see himself really committing to. All three women are fashion models and heiresses. If Tony keeps complaining about this situation like it’s some major problem (while I’m at the point where I’ve started skimming the Missed Connections page on Craigslist for descriptions of myself, just in case), he’s a total dick, right?\n\n5. If you’ve been chatting with a woman you met on Tinder once a day for four days, Valentine’s Day is in two days, and she hasn’t responded to a message you sent her five hours ago asking her if she has plans yet, how bad should you feel for hoping that maybe she’s dead rather than ignoring you?\n\n6. A friend sets you up with one of her co-workers on a blind date, on Valentine’s Day. At dinner, your date insists it’s important that “we give President Trump a chance.” If your youngest sibling is five years younger than you and is about to celebrate her second wedding anniversary in three weeks, how important is it that a couple has so much in common, really?\n\n7.

        "Video\n\nWASHINGTON — F.B.I. agents interviewed Michael T. Flynn when he was national security adviser in the first days of the Trump administration about his conversations with the Russian ambassador, current and former officials said on Tuesday.\n\nWhile it is not clear what he said in his F.B.I. interview, investigators believed that Mr. Flynn was not entirely forthcoming, the officials said. That raises the stakes of what so far has been a political scandal that cost Mr. Flynn his job. If the authorities conclude that Mr. Flynn knowingly lied to the F.B.I., it could expose him to a felony charge. President Trump asked for Mr. Flynn’s resignation Monday night.\n\nMr. Flynn maintained publicly for more than a week after his interview that his conversations with the ambassador had been innocuous and did not involve sanctions against Russia, something now known to be false.\n\nGot a confidential news tip? The New York Times would like to hear from readers who want to share messages and materials with our journalists.\n\nShortly after the F.B.I. interview, on Jan. 26, the acting attorney general, Sally Q. Yates, told the White House that Mr. Flynn was vulnerable to Russian blackmail because of inconsistencies between what he had said publicly and what intelligence officials knew to be true.\n\nAt issue is a conversation during the presidential transition in which Mr. Flynn spoke to the Russian ambassador about sanctions levied against Russia by the Obama administration. The call spurred an investigation by the F.B.I. into whether Mr. Flynn had violated the rarely invoked Logan Act, which prohibits private citizens from negotiating with foreign governments in disputes with the United States.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe National Security Agency routinely eavesdrops on calls involving high-ranking foreign diplomats. Mr. Flynn was not a focus of the eavesdropping, officials said.\n\nIt is not clear whether Mr. Flynn had a lawyer for his interview with the F.B.I. or whether anyone at the White House, including lawyers there, knew the interview was happening.\n\nSean Spicer, the White House press secretary, said on Tuesday that Mr. Trump was made aware of the situation weeks ago. Mr. Spicer said the White House had reviewed the situation and determined that Mr. Flynn did not violate any laws during his call with the Russian ambassador.\n\nMr. Spicer said Mr. Flynn was asked to resign because he had lost the trust of the president and vice president.\n\nIn late December, Mr. Flynn spoke with Sergey I. Kislyak, Russia’s ambassador to the United States. During the call, Mr. Flynn and the ambassador discussed sanctions, according to current and former United States officials. In the call, Mr. Flynn indicated that the Obama administration was Moscow’s adversary and that relations would change under Mr. Trump.\n\nBut on Jan. 14, Mr. Flynn told Mike Pence, then the vice president-elect, that he had not discussed sanctions in his call. The next day, Mr. Pence went on “Fox News Sunday” and declared: “I talked to General Flynn yesterday, and the conversations that took place at that time were not in any way related to the new U.S. sanctions against Russia or the expulsion of diplomats.”\n\nEven after F.B.I. agents later interviewed Mr. Flynn and Ms. Yates warned the White House, Mr. Flynn denied yet again — this time to The Washington Post on Wednesday — that he had discussed sanctions with the Russian ambassador.", 
        "President Donald Trump’s embattled national security adviser Michael Flynn resigned late Monday night, following reports that he had misled Vice President Mike Pence and other officials about his contacts with Russia. His departure upends Trump’s senior team after less than one month in office.\n\nIn a resignation letter, Flynn said he held numerous calls with the Russian ambassador to the US during the transition and gave “incomplete information” about those discussions to Vice President Mike Pence. The vice president, apparently relying on information from Flynn, initially said the national security adviser had not discussed sanctions with the Russian envoy, though Flynn later conceded the issue may have come up.\n\nTrump named retired Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg as the acting national security adviser. Kellogg had previously been appointed the National Security Council chief of staff and advised Trump on national security issues during the campaign.\n\nThe Justice Department warned the Trump administration weeks ago that contradictions between the public depictions and the actual details of the calls could leave Flynn in a compromised position, an administration official and two other people with knowledge of the situation told The Associated Press Monday night.\n\nOne person with knowledge of the situation said the Justice Department alerted the White House that there was a discrepancy between what officials were saying publicly about the contacts and the facts of what had occurred. Pence — apparently relying on information from Flynn — initially said sanctions were not discussed in the calls, though Flynn has now told White House officials that the topic may have come up.\n\nA second official said the Justice Department was concerned Flynn could be in a compromised position as a result.\n\nThe White House has been aware of the Justice Department warnings for “weeks,” an administration official said, though it was unclear whether Trump and Pence had been alerted.\n\nThe people insisted on anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly. The Washington Post was the first to report the communication between the Justice Department, including former acting attorney general Sally Yates, and the Trump administration.\n\nRead more\n\nFlynn apologized to Pence last week, following a Washington Post report asserting that the national security adviser has indeed discussed sanctions with the Russian envoy.\n\nWhite House spokesman Sean Spicer said Trump was consulting with Pence on Monday about his conversations with the national security adviser. Asked whether the president had been aware that Flynn might discuss sanctions with the Russian envoy, Spicer said, “No, absolutely not.”\n\nTrump, who comments on a steady stream of issues on his Twitter feed, has been conspicuously silent about the matter since The Washington Post reported last week that Flynn had discussed sanctions with the Russian envoy. A US official told The Associated Press that Flynn was in frequent contact with Ambassador Sergey Kislyak on the day the Obama administration slapped sanctions on Russia for election-related hacking, as well as at other times during the transition.\n\nFlynn’s discussions with the Russian raised questions about whether Flynn offered assurances about the incoming administration’s new approach. Such conversations would breach diplomatic protocol and possibly violate the Logan Act, a law aimed at keeping citizens from conducting diplomacy.\n\nEarlier Monday, White House counselor Kellyanne Conway said Trump had “full confidence” in Flynn, though her assertions were not backed up by other senior Trump aides. Spicer would say only that Flynn was continuing to carry out “his daily functions.”\n\nFlynn was spotted near the Oval Office just after 10 p.m. Monday. Amid the uncertainty over Flynn’s future, several of the president’s top advisers, including chief of staff Reince Priebus and counsel Don McGahn, ducked in and out of late-night meetings in the West Wing.\n\nSeveral House Democrats called on Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, to launch an investigation into Flynn’s ties to Russia. House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi called for Flynn to be fired, saying he “cannot be trusted not to put Putin before America.”\n\nRepublican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine said that if Pence were misled, “I can’t imagine he would have trust in Gen. Flynn going forward.” She said it would also be “troubling” if Flynn had been negotiating with a foreign government before taking office.\n\nIt’s illegal for private citizens to conduct U.S. diplomacy. Flynn’s conversations also raise questions about Trump’s friendly posture toward Russia after U.S. intelligence agencies concluded that Moscow hacked Democratic emails during the election.\n\nThe controversy comes as Trump and his top advisers seek to steady the White House after a rocky start. The president, who seeks input from a wide range of business associates, friends and colleagues, has been asking people their opinions on his senior team, including Spicer and Priebus.\n\nAdvisers have privately conceded that the White House spit out too many disparate messages in the first few weeks, though they also note that the president’s own tweets sometimes muddy the day’s plans before most of the White House staff has arrived for work.\n\nTrump voiced support for Priebus Monday, saying the chief of staff was doing, “not a good job, a great job.” But he did not make a similar show of support for his national security adviser.\n\nFlynn sat in the front row of Trump’s news conference with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau earlier Monday. The president did not receive a question about Flynn’s future from the two reporters who were called upon, and he ignored journalists’ shouted follow-up inquiries as he left the room.\n\nOver the weekend, Trump told associates he was troubled by the situation, but did not say whether he planned to ask Flynn to step down, according to a person who spoke with him recently. Flynn was a loyal Trump supporter during the campaign, but he is viewed skeptically by some in the administration’s national security circles, in part because of his ties to Russia.\n\nIn 2015, Flynn was paid to attend a gala dinner for Russia Today, a Kremlin-backed television station, and sat next to Russian President Vladimir Putin during the event.\n\nFlynn spoke with the vice president about the matter twice on Friday, according to an administration official. The official said Pence was relying on information from Flynn when he went on television and denied that sanctions were discussed with Kislyak.\n\nThe administration officials and those who spoke with the president recently were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and insisted on anonymity.\n\nThe controversy surrounding Flynn comes as the young administration grapples with a series of national security challenges, including North Korea’s reported ballistic missile launch. The president, who was joined at his Mar-a-Lago estate by Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe over the weekend, voiced solidarity with Japan.\n\nThe White House is also dealing with fallout from the rocky rollout of Trump’s immigration executive order, which has been blocked by the courts. The order was intended to suspend the nation’s refugee program and bar citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the United States.",

        "NAT Fyfe says he has no plans to change his leadership style after being officially unveiled as Fremantle’s ninth captain.\n\nThe Brownlow medallist, who becomes a restricted free agent at the end of this season, reiterated that he saw his future as playing for Fremantle in speaking for the first time following this morning’s leadership vote.\n\nHe said he had learned much about leadership from former skipper and club great Matthew Pavlich as he vowed that stepping into the captaincy role would not change his approach to football.\n\nFyfe becomes skipper\n\nFyfe delivered the strong message surrounded by the rest of the Dockers six-man leadership group, including new inductees Michael Walters and Lachie Neale.\n\nThe 25-year-old said he was not aware of any internal friction throughout the club’s horror 2016 season about how he applied himself as a leader.\n\n“I won’t change anything,” Fyfe said.\n\n“Another 12 months has given me more opportunities to learn and gather some information and wisdom on the best way to approach leadership.\n\n“I’m 25 and I feel I’m fairly well connected to the rough age demographic of our group at the moment.\n\n“Along with Lachie Neale, Michael Walters, there’s some fresh younger guys in that group and I’ve got a lot to learn.”\n\nFyfe is yet to sign a new contract with Fremantle beyond the 2017 season.\n\nHe said his appointment to the captaincy should not be viewed as an indication of an imminent commitment.\n\n“I said publicly last year that I see my future as playing footy for Fremantle,” Fyfe said.\n\n“I’ve got to focus primarily on getting myself back and playing some good footy this year and the contract stuff will take care of itself.\n\n“But I have said publicly and nothing has changed that I want to play my football at Fremantle.”\n\nFyfe said he would draw on the experience of both Pavlich and outgoing skipper David Mundy.\n\nHe hosed down speculation over any conflict in his relationship with 31-year-old Mundy, who remains in the leadership group after serving one season as captain.\n\n“The relationship I have with Dave is extremely strong,” Fyfe said.\n\n“He was the first person to extend a hand and say congratulations. The support that he’s shown me over the last 12 months, particularly given the troubles the club has had in only winning four games of footy, has been tremendous.\n\n“I will lean on David heavily over the first part of the role, but going forward because his leadership is something that I really value.”", 
        "Dockers coach Ross Lyon may have dropped the biggest hint yet that the club is preparing for life after Nat Fyfe in an interview with the AFL website.\n\nLyon was asked explicitly whether he was happy with the club's contract negotiations with the superstar midfielder during the interview.\n\nHis response won't inspire confidence in Fremantle fans hoping to see Fyfe at the club beyond 2017.\n\n\"Well yeah, we're all passing through. Nothing is forever,\" Lyon told afl.com.au.\n\nIf Fyfe doesn't re-sign before the end of the season he will become a restricted free agent which means he is eligible to field offers from all rival AFL clubs.\n\nAnd, with a Brownlow Medal already under his belt, offers are likely to come thick and fast for the 25-year-old with Fyfe likely to attract offers of more than $1 million a season should he opt to change clubs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere have been rumours about Fyfe's future ever since the Dockers coach said last July the Brownlow Medallist could leave the club if it does not convince him it has a plan for future success. Fyfe has already been linked to Carlton and several other Victorian clubs.\n\n\"If Nathan believes in that plan coming his way, he'll be here, I've got no doubt. If he doesn't, and we don't bring him along, he'd be a chance to leave,\" Lyon said at the time.\n\nSHARE\n\nShare on Facebook SHARE\n\nShare on Twitter TWEET\n\nPin to Pinterest PIN\n\nLink Has Ross Lyon dropped a hint that he's preparing for life with Nat Fyfe? Photo: Getty Images\n\nHowever it seems that if a big rival offer does come, Lyon would be eager for the Dockers to match the contract, which they have the right to do given Fyfe will be a restricted free agent.\n\n\"There's a big difference,\" Lyon told afl.com.au, alluding to this situation.\n\nHowever so far no club has matched a restricted free agency offer with the presiding view to let a player go who no longer wants to be at the club.\n\nLyon said speculation about Fyfe's future wouldn't be a distraction for the club this season as it aims to get back on track following a disastrous 2016 campaign which saw Fremantle finish in the AFL's bottom four.\n\nHe said he accepted players had a modern-day right to explore their options under free agency.\n\n\"We can't control it and at the end of the day every player is entitled to source the market, make a decision and move on,\" he told afl.com.au.\n\n\"All we can do is provide the best environment and [ensure] that the player sees that they can become what they want to become, and it's commercially viable because at the end of the day it's a profession for them.\n\n\"It's not something I sit around and mull about it. I just do what I can do and I've experienced it before. There have been lots of great players that have been out of contract, but I let the cobblers do the cobbling.\"\n\n\"But the speculation is going to be there all year.\"\n\nDespite the speculation surrounding his future at the club, Fyfe is tipped to become the Dockers next captain, taking over the reigns from David Mundy.\n\nAn endorsement of the champion midfielder as captain is expected to strengthen the club's prospects of keeping Fyfe on a long term contract.\n\nFyfe was beaten in a vote for captain last January when veteran Mundy was elected to replace Dockers icon Matthew Pavlich, who stood down ahead of his last season as a player.\n\nMundy, 31, is believed to be resigned to losing the captaincy after just one season.\n\nFyfe, who hasn't played for the Dockers since round five last year after he broke his leg for a second time against Carlton, has hardly missed a beat this preseason and looks set to feature in the JLT Community Series before making his AFL comeback in round one.\n\n\"He's only missed one session this pre-season,\" Fremantle's senior development coach Marc Webb told Sport FM last month.\n\n\"He is really committed and a really focused person, and he's been able to put the extra k's in, and he's going at a hundred miles an hour to get ready for round one.\"",

They are a group of people that will just naturally defend each of those teams and the NDIS was thrown into one of the murkiest, dirtiest parts of that game,\" Fearnley said.\n\n\"It is mischief … it is political opportunism and it is just wrong.\n\n\"I am confused and just disheartened they would continue this argument.\"\n\nFearnley is a passionate disability advocate and Australian wheelchair racing legend.\n\nHe has a congenital disorder called sacral agenesis which affected the development of certain parts of his lower spine.\n\n\"How we speak about this, how community speaks about this, that's important for my community of people with disabilities so that we no longer feel as if we are a burden,\" he said.\n\n\"There have been very few times in our community over the last few years where you could sit with pride and say that our leaders had truly made a massive investment to make people's lives better.\"\n\n'Sledgehammer negotiation tactic': Xenophon\n\nLabor and the Greens stand opposed to many aspects of the bill and South Australian senator Nick Xenophon, who controls three votes in the Upper House, will not support the bill in its current form.\n\nSenator Xenophon said the attempt to link the bill's passage to NDIS funding was a \"sledgehammer\" negotiation tactic.\n\nDisability People Organisation Australia chief executive Therese Sands said she did not support funding the NDIS through cuts to other social services.\n\n\"We are shocked and troubled about this announcement from Treasurer Scott Morrison that once again links cuts to social security with funding for the NDIS,\" she said.\n\n\"We have stated clearly, including in our pre-budget submission, that we reject any ties to funding the NDIS by cutting social security.\n\nTopics: disabilities, health, government-and-politics, federal-government, australia\n\nFirst posted",

        "A resurgent One Nation is looking to the Western Australian state election, on 11 March, as its first opportunity to demonstrate its growing support since last July’s federal election. Recent polling suggests One Nation is on track to win numerous seats in Western Australia’s upper house, and could even break through in the lower house.\n\nTony Abbott says Liberals should always preference Nationals ahead of One Nation Read more\n\nOne Nation’s prospects were given a further boost at the weekend when the Liberal party announced a preference swap with the minor party: Liberal preferences will favour One Nation in the upper house, while One Nation will give the Liberals a boost in lower house marginal seats.\n\n\n\nThe Liberal/National government in WA is facing an uphill battle to win a third term in office, and One Nation preferences will give them a boost. When One Nation first broke through in the late 1990s, they took a hefty chunk out of the Coalition vote, and that vote often did not return as preferences.\n\n\n\nRecent polls have put One Nation on as high a vote as 13% in Western Australia. In contrast, the party polled just over 4% in the Western Australian Senate race in 2016. Last week on my blog I analysed where One Nation did best in that Senate election, and what the One Nation vote could look like if it jumped to 13%.\n\n\n\nOne Nation vote in WA, based on the 2016 federal senate vote, projected on to state seats\n\nOne Nation’s vote is strongly concentrated in regional areas, with a much lower vote in Perth. This reflects how One Nation performed in the 2001 Western Australian state election, where they won three upper house seats in regional areas.\n\n\n\nConveniently for One Nation, the Western Australian upper house is severely biased in favour of country voters. Approximately three-quarters of the state’s population lives in the Perth metropolitan area, but Perth voters only elect half of the state’s upper house. These regional voters overwhelmingly favour parties on the right, and this has helped give the current government a sizeable majority in the upper house.\n\n\n\nIf One Nation was to poll 13%, they would easily poll over a quota in the Agricultural, Mining and Pastoral, and South West regions, and could do reasonably well in the East Metropolitan region, giving them four seats in the upper house. This is made easier thanks to those Liberal preferences.\n\n\n\nOne Nation could well be a threat to Nationals seats in the lower house, too, but they won’t benefit from Liberal preferences in those races. Liberal preferences to One Nation in the lower house could have had a devastating effect on the Nationals, wiping out quite a few of their MPs and making it much harder for the Liberal party to form government. In the upper house, on the other hand, One Nation are likely to win multiple seats with or without Liberal assistance, and a re-elected Liberal government would have an interest in working with a One Nation bloc in the balance of power.\n\n\n\nThere is a four-way contest for conservative votes in regional Western Australia. The Liberals and Nationals will be competing against each other for seats in both houses, alongside One Nation and the Shooters, Fishers and Farmers party, who hold two seats in the upper house.\n\n\n\nOne Nation dissidents say 'mercenary' preference deal is a tattoo that will mark Liberals Read more\n\nUpper house preferences were formally lodged on Monday, and we saw some unusual decisions motivated by the Liberal-One Nation deal. The Nationals have decided to favour the Greens over their Liberal coalition partners, while the Shooters have gained preferences from many parties, including the Nationals.\n\n\n\nThe Liberal-National government’s chances of re-election will be boosted thanks to One Nation preferences, but only if the deal can hold. Upper house preferences in Western Australia are required to be lodged ahead of time, and they will flow regardless of whether a party can find the volunteers to distribute how-to-vote cards at polling place, thanks to the group voting ticket system (the same system which was used for the Senate prior to law changes in 2016).\n\n\n\nIn contrast, One Nation preferences in the lower house are only as good as the party’s capacity to hand out how-to-votes making the recommendation. One Nation voters have traditionally been happy to follow their party’s recommendations, but there are signs that some One Nation candidates are not willing to go along with their party’s deal. If candidates in key seats refuse to go along with the deal, the Liberal party could be left empty-handed, after giving away something quite valuable.\n\n", 
        "The Nationals leader Barnaby Joyce has held out the prospect of preferencing One Nation ahead of Labor at the federal level, saying he will make a final determination based on the policies being offered by other political parties.\n\n\n\nWith government ministers lining up in recent days to pave the way for the Liberal party to do preference deals with One Nation at the federal level, Joyce was asked on Sky News on Tuesday whether he would approve of putting One Nation ahead of Labor on a Nationals how-to-vote card in a federal election.\n\nJoyce said it was a question of policies. “It depends what policies they bring forward.”\n\nGuardian Essential Report: Cory Bernardi's party could win 18% of Coalition voters Read more\n\n“If the Labor party come forward with policies [like a 50% renewable energy target], with bat-poo crazy policies, so that Australia looks like South Australia, then I will consider them on their policies.”\n\nHe said he’d never subscribed to the view that One Nation should be put last. “When everyone said you’ve got to put One Nation last, I never did in New England.”\n\nJoyce repeated his mantra that policy was the test. “I’ll judge people by their policies. If they say mad things then you won’t get our preferences. If you say reasonable things, then we’ll consider it.”\n\nThe Nationals leader has been critical of a decision by the West Australian Liberal party to put One Nation ahead of the Nationals in some regions in the forthcoming state election.\n\nWith Labor this week on the offensive about the WA preference deal with One Nation, declaring the Coalition should abide by John Howard’s practice of putting One Nation last on how-to-vote cards – Joyce also attempted on Tuesday to blunt the attack by ridiculing Labor’s practice of preferencing the Greens.\n\nIn an attempt to deflect focus from the obvious shift in favour of preferencing One Nation, and create a kind of equivalence, government frontbenchers, including Joyce, have characterised the Greens as an extremist party.\n\nBut Joyce became stranded on Tuesday by a decision by the Nationals in WA to preference the Greens ahead of the Liberals in the state election – a move which is clearly a retaliation against the WA Liberals decision to strike the deal with One Nation.\n\nJoyce on Sky News criticised his colleagues in the WA Nationals for choosing to put the Greens above the Liberals. “I don’t think that’s a good idea.”\n\n“It’s all retaliation. The Libs put One Nation above the Nats, and then Nats have come back and put the Greens above the Libs – then what happens?”\n\n“This is what happens when you start picking on your business partner or your girlfriend or whatever. One scratches, the other one scratches back. It’s not an outcome you want.”\n\nJoyce said he intended to work out a preference strategy for the Nationals at the federal level in consultation with his colleagues.\n\nAsked whether he agreed with arguments a number of cabinet colleagues had made in recent days that One Nation was a more sophisticated political party than it was at the time Howard declared it needed to be put last, Joyce hedged.\n\nHe said their “delivery is more polished”.\n\nDuring a separate interview with the ABC on Tuesday night, Joyce was asked whether he’d asked Turnbull for a guarantee at the federal level that the Liberals would not preference One Nation ahead of the Nationals. He said he didn’t need to ask for such a guarantee.\n\nControversy over preferences rolled through the political day in Canberra, as did the continuing finger-pointing over energy policy.\n\nEarly in the day the government suffered a blow when the Nick Xenophon Team confirmed it would not support the childcare and omnibus savings bill package which the government has wanted to legislate in the opening phase of the parliamentary year.\n\nThe NXT’s opposition will force the government to negotiate in an effort to salvage the childcare package and savings measures.\n\nThe treasurer Scott Morrison said on Tuesday evening the government would work through the proposals with the crossbench, measure by measure. Morrison was asked whether the government would consider raising the Medicare levy to raise additional revenue to pay for childcare and other spending, but he dead batted. “It’s not my practice to go into a shopping list of items [ahead of the budget].”\n\nThe prime minister, Joyce and the deputy Liberal leader, Julie Bishop, emphasised during their regular party room meeting the importance of doubling down on their current energy campaign.\n\nJoyce told colleagues it was important to engage the ALP on “our own issue, energy security” and Bishop observed it was a potent issue for the Coalition.\n\nThe prime minister said the government, by focusing on cost-of-living issues, had made progress after a “difficult start” to the year.\n\nHe declared the Labor leader Bill Shorten was a member of the “mindless, unplanned renewable energy club”.\n\nThe aggression rolled through into question time. Asked a question about a weekend report in Guardian Australia revealing extreme price spikes in Queensland’s fossil fuel-dominated electricity market this year had far eclipsed those seen in South Australia – the prime minister refused to engage with the substance, and resorted to ridicule.\n\nBarnaby Joyce says Labor has 'bat-poo crazy ideas' about renewables – as it happened Read more\n\n“There’s a wonderful retro quality about the leader of the opposition’s performance today,” Turnbull told the parliament. “He reminds me of one of those old Soviet leaders whose country slipped backwards and backwards and they would be able to produce some figures from Gosplan showing the umbrella factory was beating production levels.”\n\nEarlier in the day Turnbull met a delegation of business leaders from South Australia concerned about energy prices and energy security in the state. The group has also been pressing Xenophon to support the government’s company tax cut plan, but the NXT leader has held out giving his support to the proposed cut for big businesses.\n\nXenophon has signalled in the past he wants the government to deal substantially with energy policy, including agreeing to a form of carbon trading for the electricity sector, before he will consider tax cuts for big companies.",
