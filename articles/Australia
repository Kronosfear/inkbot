This would involve removing section 25 of the constitution, which says the states can ban people from voting based on their race; minor change to the race power and the addition of some symbolic words of recognition.\n\nThe co-convenors of the Melbourne dialogue said a voice to Parliament, in the form of an Aboriginal body embedded in the constitution, emerged as a strong priority in the discussions.\n\n\"This body could consult on laws and policies about our people, to help hold government to account. It could work under and incorporate the principles of the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, which could be articulated in statement of acknowledgement or a legislated declaration,\" they said.\n\n\"The body could help drive reforms to enable agreement-making, so that a truth and reconciliation process can be pursued.

        "body0": "Inequalities in the native title system are limiting the flow of benefits to traditional owners from agreements with governments and industry, a new report suggests.\n\nThe report, released by Curtin University and the University of Western Australia this week, found that, even after native title had been recognised, the weak bargaining position \u201cinherent in the legislation\u201d created significant barriers to positive outcomes for native title holders and left them at the mercy of their negotiating partners.\n\nIn one case, it found, that led to native title holders feeling they had bargained away native title rights without receiving anything in return.\n\nAbout 85% of Western Australia\u2019s land mass is either held under native title or currently subject to a native title application. The majority of applications are made in the Kimberley, where 70% of the region is held under a determined native title claim but native title also covers significant parts of the Pilbara, central desert, Goldfields and south-western districts.\n\nNoongar native title deal ruled invalid by federal court Read more\n\nThe largest of those claims, settled after years of negotiation through the $1.3bn Noongar Indigenous Land Use Agreement (ILUA), was ruled invalid in the federal court last month after some traditional custodians refused to approve the agreement.\n\nThat prompted the Turnbull government to propose a hasty amendment to the Native Title Act (1993) to protect other agreements from appeal by restoring the presumption that agreements only needed majority support from native title holders to be valid. Labor has indicated on Tuesday that it will support the move.\n\nCurtin University associate professor Michael Dockery, who co-authored the report, said native title law was a \u201cminefield\u201d and the collapse of the Noongar deal \u201cjust highlights how complex it is and how much these people are at the whim of the legal system and changes of government and policy\u201d.\n\n\u201cNative title doesn\u2019t really give you any sort of power,\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t really own the land, you just have a right to negotiate \u2026 That doesn\u2019t necessarily offer you anything tangible. You are not sitting on a pot of gold.\u201d\n\nThe report contained a qualitative analysis of three post-determination native title agreements in WA: the 2013 ILUA between Yindjibarndi Aboriginal Corporation and Rio Tinto in the Pilbara; the 2005 ILUA between the Miriuwung-Gajerrong people, operating MG Corp, and the WA government in the Ord River valley, known as the Ord final agreement; and a series of right to negotiate or future acts agreements between the Gooiyandi Aboriginal Corporation and pastoral stations in the the Fitzroy Valley.\n\nIt found that while the Yindjibarndi were generally happy with their agreement with Rio, and felt Rio had generally operated \u201cin good faith\u201d, the Miriuwung-Gajerrong had been strung along by a 10-year promise for agricultural land that had not eventuated because the WA government had delayed the roll out of the Ord River scheme, upon which all promises of economic development and job creation hinged.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very clear the proponents that we spoke to from the Miriuwung-Gajerrong \u2026 were essentially let down by the state government,\u201d Dockery said. \u201cEverything was delayed by a unilateral decision from the state government and they essentially left the traditional owners hanging.\u201d\n\nThat agreement saw the WA government compulsorily acquire 65,000ha held under exclusive possession native title to develop the Ord River stage 2 agricultural scheme in return for a $57m package, which included $24m to establish and maintain MG Corp, $14m into a charitable community trust, $11m in compensation for damage done when the Ord River was dammed and flooded in the 1960s, and $15m in land transferred to the Miriuwung-Gajerrong community, including nine community sites.\n\nLabor to support native title changes to protect mining deals Read more\n\nEleven years on, the report found, there had been no improvement in the living conditions of Miriuwung-Gajerrong people.\n\n\u201cAll those benefits that came from the Ord agreement had conditions put to them, right, and the conditions were never favourable to what MG wanted to do, right, because we had to comply with them for the first 10 years,\u201d one Aboriginal director of MG Corp, quoted in the report, said.\n\nHe continued: \u201cThere were supposed to be certain lands which were to be released for economic developments. The Ord final agreement gave the Miriuwung-Gajerrong people or the MG Corporation 10 years to \u2018make yourself self-sustaining\u2019. Ten years have gone. The lands, which were economically viable, we still haven\u2019t got, and the state keeps telling us \u2018when it is convenient\u2019 for them.\u201d\n\nDockery said native title holders were at a disadvantage in negotiations because they did not receive any formalised funding or support to operate as directors of a corporation, despite being required to establish a prescribed body corporate under the Native Title Act.\n\n\u201cThe prescribed bodies are created by law, by federal legislation,\u201d he said. \u201cTo actually properly facilitate those orders, you really need to be an expert in law, in finance, in commercial law \u2026 it takes an enormous commitment in time.\n\n\u201cThe burden is such that it prohibited [directors of native title corporations] holding any other job. You can\u2019t work when this is taking up all your time and all of it is completely unpaid. You couldn\u2019t imagine a similar situation in a white fella world.\u201d\n\nThe report recommended the WA government petition the Council of Australian Governments to introduce a funding regime for native title corporations and investigate establishing a tertiary education course to give directors of those organisations the legal and financial knowledge to both negotiate with developers and manage a charitable trust.", 
        "body2": "Learn words in Indigenous Australian languages with four young speakers\n\nUpdated\n\nAlthough English is the most commonly spoken language, Australia is linguistically diverse. But that's always been the case.\n\nMany languages, sub-languages and dialects were spoken across the continent before 1788. The figure that's often cited is 250 \u2014 but that's only the number of distinct languages, as opposed to variations or regional dialects of a language chain.\n\nMost Aboriginal languages spoken today are endangered, some critically so.\n\nThe campaign to maintain those still being actively spoken and revive dormant or \"sleeping\" languages is being fought on many fronts, and Indigenous communities themselves are spearheading the fight.\n\nThese four Indigenous Australians are part of the fight to maintain our linguistic diversity.\n\nKylie Bracknell: Nyungar\n\nActor Kylie Bracknell speaks Nyungar, the language of what is now Perth and the south-west of Western Australia. \"I love my language,\" she says.\n\nFor Bracknell, certain words evoke memories of when she was learning Nyungar. One of her grandmothers was particularly instrumental in her language education.\n\n\"My maternal grandmother's cousin taught me a lot of language as a young woman. The memory is picking her up from East Perth train station, and I had a real flash car.\n\n\"She walked over to me, and jumped in the car, put her bag in, just off the train and said, 'Whoa, bilawiny.' And then I said, \"Nana, what does bilawiny mean?\"\n\n\"''Shining,' she reckoned, 'this one here is shining.'\"\n\nThere are even onomatopoeic words. In Nyungar, boolyaka means to take off quickly, but doubles as the word for diarrhoea.\n\nMeaning often slips between the human and the natural world. In Nyungar, the word for rain (midjal, midjaliny) also describes tears \u2014 or weeping.\n\nEvelyn Araluen: Bundjalung\n\nIn the Bundjalung language of northern New South Wales the word for your shoulder \u2014 ganggil \u2014 also describes the branch of a tree and a bird's wing. Another word for branch \u2014 jarang \u2014 doubles as the term for the thigh or leg, and the confluence of two rivers.\n\nA PhD candidate in Indigenous literatures at the University of Sydney, Evelyn Araluen is also a student of Bundjalung.\n\n\"This duality demonstrates that there's a really strong connection between our language, our bodies and the land and that this is all incredibly central to the way we communicate.\"\n\nJason O'Neil: Wiradjuri\n\nThe Wiradjuri language covers a vast area of central western New South Wales from Gilgandra in the north to the banks of the Murray in the south and west to Hay beyond the Great Dividing Range.\n\nLanguage is deeply embedded in country for Jason O'Neil, a Wiradjuri man from Parkes, who's in his fifth year of a law degree at the University of New South Wales.\n\nThere's even a term that describes an ethical way of living.\n\n\"Yindyamarra speaks of respect, but also of and gentleness, honour and learning to do things slowly. It is by living with yindyamarra that we live in harmony and respect with each other and with country,\" he says.\n\nBut as with many Aboriginal languages there's no simple way of saying goodbye in Wiradjuri. Traditionally, there was little use for such a term.\n\nThe nearest word like that in Wiradjuri is guwayu \u2013 which means in a little while, later or after some time.\n\nLille Madden: Gadigal\n\nLille Madden is a Gadigal woman from Sydney. Some of the first Aboriginal language words ever recorded were given by the Gadigal woman Patyegarang to a naval officer William Dawes on the foreshore of Sydney Harbour in the early 1790s.\n\n\"It's fortunate that she gave this gift of language to Dawes \u2014 it's the last remaining written down knowledge of the Gadigal language,\" says Madden.\n\nDawes' handwritten notebooks, kept in the School of Oriental and African Studies in London, are the first systematic attempt to document an Aboriginal language.\n\nOne of those words describes an almost intimate act and there is no single word in English which describes precisely the same thing.\n\n\"Putuwa means to warm your hands by the fire while gently squeezing the fingers of another person.\"\n\nEvery week, RN's Word Up features the diverse languages of black Australia \u2014 one word at a time.\n\nTopics: languages, aboriginal-language, indigenous-aboriginal-and-torres-strait-islander, indigenous-policy, perth-6000, wa, australia, lismore-2480, orange-2800, sydney-2000, nsw\n\nFirst posted",

        "body0": "The planned House vote on the American Health Care Act Thursday is being interpreted as a major test for Donald Trump\u2019s presidency. If it fails, the thinking goes, he\u2019ll have fallen victim to a humiliating defeat that will imperil the rest of his agenda.\n\nBut perhaps Trump should be thinking more about the risks of success.\n\nThis is such a giant mess, and everyone knows it, and they might pass this thing anyway. \u2014 Jeffrey Young (@JeffYoung) March 21, 2017\n\nWhile it\u2019s still unclear whether the AHCA will pass the House, its chances of success appear more favorable compared to a week ago. Deals are being cut, and the White House is trying to twist arms. And Trump himself desperately wants to get health care done so he can move on to other agenda items he finds more exciting. In the end, it\u2019s possible that enough Republicans in the House will vote for the bill purely because they believe its failure would deal a debilitating blow to Trump\u2019s presidency.\n\nBut all this would be in service to a bill that wouldn\u2019t just break Trump\u2019s campaign promises \u2014 it would make a mockery of them. The AHCA guts Medicaid despite Trump\u2019s promise not to cut the program. It gives people buying insurance on the individual marketplaces a flat tax credit rather than a subsidy pegged to their income and to the cost of insurance in their area. It lets insurers charge more to older Americans and gives them absurdly little to help them cover their costs.\n\nIf this actually does become law, it would have tremendously negative consequences for millions of Americans\u2019 lives. And Trump wouldn\u2019t be able to get around this with snake oil \u2014 people would be hit right in their pocketbooks, as Ezra Klein wrote Monday:\n\nWhat happens when voters realize their new tax credit doesn\u2019t cover anything close to the insurance they had? What happens when they find themselves with fewer choices, paying much higher premiums after their smaller subsidies, and being told by insurers that costs are doubling because Republicans changed how much more the old could be charged than the young? Voters will notice all this. And what are Republicans going to say then? That it\u2019s all Barack Obama\u2019s fault? That high deductibles are actually good, they just forgot to mention it? That they needed something they could pass quickly so they could move on to tax reform?\n\nWhat ordinarily happens with controversial legislation is that lawmakers work to try their best to solve these problems before the bill passes. They deliberate, they consult the relevant stakeholders, they take analytical critiques seriously, and they adjust.\n\nBut for the AHCA, House Republicans are making no serious effort to do this. Paul Ryan crafted the bill in secret, there was no public deliberative process to speak of, and now Republicans are simply trying to jam it through, with whatever special buyouts and magic asterisks prove necessary.\n\nNow, the Senate may step in to bail them out. Senators could well put in the time and hard work to reshape the AHCA into serious policy. (\u201cRemember, we\u2019re gonna go to the Senate and we\u2019re gonna go back and forth and we\u2019re gonna negotiate and it\u2019s gonna be wonderful,\u201d Trump said Monday night.) Perhaps even more likely, senators could kill the bill entirely, and rescue the House from its own irresponsibility.\n\nBut partisanship is a hell of a drug, and if Republican senators do want to unite and pass a bill without adequately improving it, they certainly can. That would be dreadful policy. And policy that negatively impacts people\u2019s lives will likely have seriously negative political consequences for Republicans too. The way out of this mess is for the GOP to instead slow down and try to get this right.\n\nThree interpretations of the Comey hearing\n\nOur daily politics news roundup will check in on several other stories, so here\u2019s a look at more big news of the day:\n\nFBI Director James Comey\u2019s confirmation that, yes, the bureau is indeed investigating ties between Russia and Donald Trump\u2019s campaign and associates, is enormously significant news that will continue to hang over Trump\u2019s presidency for some time.\n\nAnd while Comey was tight-lipped about details, a few commentators tried to read between the lines of his testimony.\n\nBen Wittes of Lawfare speculates that, because Comey wasn\u2019t all that over-the-top or gratuitous in criticizing Trump\u2019s inaccurate tweets about Obama wiretapping him, that\u2019s an indication that there\u2019s a very serious investigation going on that he doesn\u2019t want to jeopardize by picking fights.\n\nMarcy Wheeler at EmptyWheel flags an exchange in which Comey explained he was slow to brief Congress on the investigation because briefing Congress usually involves briefing the executive branch too, and \u201csometimes we want to keep it tight within the executive branch.\u201d So who inside the executive branch, Wheeler asks, did the FBI not want to brief?\n\nByron York of the Washington Examiner highlights the same exchange, and argued Comey\u2019s failure to brief the relevant politicians led to public confusion. \u201cThe fact that the FBI, for so many months, would not acknowledge the existence of the probe led to widespread public doubt \u2014 and wild debate \u2014 about what was happening,\u201d he writes.\n\nNormal or not normal? Consequential or inconsequential?\n\nDonald Trump is a very unusual president, but not everything he does is unusual, and it\u2019s good to keep that in perspective. Furthermore, some of Trump\u2019s unusual actions just don\u2019t matter all that much, while many relatively \u201cnormal\u201d political developments in our political system can be deeply consequential. So here\u2019s a necessarily subjective attempt to assess just how abnormal, and how consequential, recent news items are.\n\nIvanka Trump\u2019s new White House role\n\nWhat happened : Politico\u2019s Annie Karni reports that Ivanka Trump is getting a West Wing office and an expanded White House role, though she still won\u2019t officially be a government employee.\n\n: Politico\u2019s Annie Karni reports that Ivanka Trump is getting a West Wing office and an expanded White House role, though she still won\u2019t officially be a government employee. Is it abnormal? Yes. Ivanka has never worked in government and as her own lawyer admitted to Karni, \u201cHaving an adult child of the president who is actively engaged in the work of the administration is new ground.\u201d There are comparisons \u2014 Hillary Clinton\u2019s White House role on health care during her husband\u2019s administration, and Robert F. Kennedy\u2019s service as attorney general during his brother\u2019s \u2014 but this is still odd.\n\nYes.

Kennedy\u2019s service as attorney general during his brother\u2019s \u2014 but this is still odd. Is it consequential? Probably not all that much. Ivanka could have an impact on internal White House power struggles, and her job could send an even stronger signal that nepotism matters to Trump. But then again her husband Jared Kushner already has a more prominent White House job, so it\u2019s not clear how much this changes.\n\nNeil Gorsuch\u2019s confirmation hearings\n\nWhat happened : Senate Judiciary Committee hearings for Judge Neil Gorsuch\u2019s Supreme Court nomination, which are expected to last four days, began Monday with everyone involved giving lengthy opening statements.\n\n: Senate Judiciary Committee hearings for Judge Neil Gorsuch\u2019s Supreme Court nomination, which are expected to last four days, began Monday with everyone involved giving lengthy opening statements. Is it abnormal? No \u2014 Gorsuch is a typical conservative nominee who could well have been nominated by any other Republican president. The only abnormal aspect to this is of course that Republicans refused to even consider President Barack Obama\u2019s nominee Merrick Garland last year.\n\nNo \u2014 Gorsuch is a typical conservative nominee who could well have been nominated by any other Republican president. The only abnormal aspect to this is of course that Republicans refused to even consider President Barack Obama\u2019s nominee Merrick Garland last year. Is it consequential? Oh, yes. Despite being \u201cnormal,\u201d Gorsuch\u2019s appointment could be Trump\u2019s most impactful action yet, since he could serve on the court for decades. Now, since Gorsuch is filling the seat of staunch conservative Antonin Scalia, his confirmation would restore the court to its pre-February 2016 status quo with Anthony Kennedy as the swing vote, rather than bringing us into new legal territory. Still, Gorsuch would prevent the swing vote seat from going to a liberal, something that could have reshaped the court for a generation.\n\nNew flight restrictions on laptop carry-ons on foreign flights into the US", 
        "body2": "President Donald Trump has signed the NASA Transition Authorization Act of 2017, which sets a $19.5 billion budget for the agency for fiscal year 2017.\n\nThe bill \u2014 S.442 \u2014 is the first NASA authorization bill to reach a U.S. president's desk since 2010. Trump signed the bill into law today (March 21) during a televised ceremony in the Oval Office. He was joined by NASA astronauts Tracy Caldwell Dyson and Chris Cassidy, who presented the commander in chief with a NASA flight jacket.\n\nFollowing the signing, Vice President Mike Pence announced that the White House will re-establish a National Space Council. The first iteration of a presidential space council was formed in 1958 under Dwight D. Eisenhower, and was dissolved in 1973. A new council was formed in 1989 under President George H. W. Bush, only to be dissolved again in 1993. The council has served to advise the president on space issues, but its value has been debated by spaceflight policy experts. Pence will chair the council, and he said that its members will include representatives from both NASA and the private sector. [Presidential Visions for NASA Throughout History]\n\nPresident Trump signed the NASA Transition Authorization Act of 2017 on March 21, surrounded by members of congress. Two NASA astronauts in attendance presented Trump with an astronaut flight jacket. Credit: Alex Wong/Getty\n\n\"With this legislation, we support NASA's scientists, engineers, astronauts and their pursuit of discoveries,\" Trump said during the signing event. \"This bill will make sure that NASA's most important and effective programs are sustained. It orders NASA to continue \u2026 transitioning activities to the commercial sector where we have seen great progress \u2026 It continues support for the Commercial Crew Program, which will carry American astronauts into space from American soil once again. It's been a long time.\"\n\n(Currently, NASA astronauts travel to the International Space Station aboard the Russia Soyuz spacecraft, which launches from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan.)\n\nAlso attending the signing were Sens. Marco Rubio and Bill Nelson, both of Florida, home to NASA's Kennedy Space Center; Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, home to NASA headquarters at the Johnson Space Flight Center in Houston; and Rep. Lamar Smith, also of Texas, chairman of the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology.\n\nThe legislation accomplishes a long-discussed goal of providing lifetime health care coverage for retired astronauts. That coverage will also help NASA monitor the long-term effects of spaceflight on humans.\n\nNASA's new heavy-lift rocket, called the Space Launch System (SLS), and the Orion human spaceflight capsule both received sustained support in the new legislation. Orion could be used to carry astronauts to the moon or to help ferry them to deep-space destinations, and the new law also calls on the agency to investigate whether the spacecraft could be used to ferry humans to the International Space Station.\n\nHonored to sign S.442 today. With this legislation, we support @NASA's scientists, engineers, and astronauts in their pursuit of discovery! pic.twitter.com/IjgBd88eN6 \u2014 President Trump (@POTUS) March 21, 2017\n\nUnder the new law, NASA will continue its efforts to eventually send humans to Mars, and the legislation \"amends current law by adding human exploration of Mars as one of the goals and objectives of NASA and directs NASA to manage human space flight programs to enable humans to explore Mars and other destinations,\" according to a statement from Cruz.\n\n\"It puts us on the dual track,\" Nelson said of the new law. \"We have the commercial companies going to and from the International Space Station, and we have NASA going out and exploring the heavens. And we're going to Mars.\"\n\nIn addition, the new legislation calls for \"maximizing utilization of the International Space Station (ISS),\" according to the statement on Cruz's website, and it maintains support for NASA's contracting of commercial companies to send crew and cargo to the ISS. NASA will continue to support the ISS at its current funding level through 2024, but the act also \"requires NASA to submit a report to Congress outlining a plan to facilitate a transformation of operations in low-Earth orbit from a model largely reliant on government support to one reflecting a more commercially viable future.\"\n\nFollowing the President's signing of the law, NASA's acting Administrator Robert Lightfoot released a statement via the agency website.\n\n\"We would like to thank President Trump for his support of the agency in signing the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Transition Authorization Act of 2017,\" Lightfoot said. \"We also want to express our gratitude to a bipartisan Congress for its thoughtful consideration of the agency\u2019s path forward. We are grateful for the longstanding support and trust of the American people, which enables our nation\u2019s space, aeronautics, science, and technology development programs to thrive.\"\n\n\"Our workforce has proven time and again that it can meet any challenge, and the continuing support for NASA ensures our nation\u2019s space program will remain the world\u2019s leader in pioneering new frontiers in exploration, innovation, and scientific achievement,\" Lightfoot said in the statement.\n\nPresident Trump signed the NASA Transition Authorization Act of 2017 on March 21, 2017, surrounded by members of Congress and two NASA astronauts. Credit: Alex Wong/Getty\n\nThe bill was originally introduced in the U.S. Senate by Sens. Cruz; Nelson; Rubio; Gary Peters, D-Mich.; John Thune, R-S.D.; Tom Udall, D-N.M.; Patty Murray, D-Wash.; and John Cornyn, R-Texas, according to Inside Outer Space. In the House, the committees with jurisdiction over the bill are the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology; and the House Subcommittee on Space, chaired by Rep. Brian Babin, R-Texas.\n\nTrump's proposed NASA budget for fiscal year 2018, which is not part of the recently enacted legislation and is still only a proposal, would reduce the agency's funding to $19.1 billion, and would likely cancel the Asteroid Redirect Mission and reduce the agency's Earth Science Division budget by $102 million.\n\nThis article was updated March 21 at 5:15 p.m. EDT to include comments from NASA's acting Administrator Robert Lightfoot.\n\nFollow Calla Cofield @callacofield.Follow us @Spacedotcom, Facebook and Google+.

Ian Paisley, who had founded the Democratic Unionist Party and had long stood for continued Ulster association with Britain, and Mr. McGuinness, who had fought for Ulster\u2019s incorporation into a united Ireland, took oaths as the leader and deputy leader, respectively, of Northern Ireland\u2019s power-sharing government.\n\nAs Prime Ministers Tony Blair of Britain and Bertie Ahern of Ireland looked on, the proceedings ended direct British control of Northern Ireland and reinstated home rule for its 1.8 million people. Legislative power was vested in a Northern Ireland Assembly, and Ulster began a new era in which long-bitter adversaries pledged to abandon armed struggles and embrace political solutions.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe I.R.A. had already destroyed its weapons and given up its clandestine cells, and Sinn Fein (pronounced shin-FAIN) had endorsed a reconstituted Ulster police force, which it had regarded for decades as an arm of British and Protestant repression.\n\nPhoto\n\nLeft unresolved was whether Northern Ireland would ever be reunited with the predominantly Catholic Irish Republic. The Good Friday Agreement provided that that could happen only with the consent of Northern Ireland, and it made it likely that Ulster and its Protestant majority would remain in perpetuity \u2014 along with the legacies of killings and religious enmities.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOnce banned from entering Britain, Mr. McGuinness won a seat in the House of Commons in London; ran unsuccessfully for the presidency of Ireland in 2011; visited prime ministers several times at 10 Downing Street; met Presidents Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama at the White House; and shook hands twice with Queen Elizabeth II.\n\n\u201cThis is the side of his political life that McGuinness wants the Irish people to remember: the reformed man, the young, hotheaded idealist who learned the error of his ways and forged peace, an achievement that still wins him plaudits from around the world,\u201d the British magazine New Statesman said in 2011. \u201cTo some in Ireland he is a hero \u2014 a man who stood up for the oppressed, who fought the British. To others, he was, is and will always be a criminal.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nJames Martin Pacelli McGuinness was born in Derry, Northern Ireland, on May 23, 1950, one of seven children of William and Peggy McGuinness, a Catholic family that shared two bedrooms and an outdoor toilet in the crowded slum of Bogside, a setting for much violence during the Troubles. His father worked in an iron foundry, and his mother in a shirt factory. The parents attended Mass and took communion daily, and they gathered their six sons and daughter nightly for a recitation of the rosary.\n\nMartin was a bright, eager boy who loved the poems of W. B. Yeats and played chess, but he failed the 11 Plus exams in his last year in grade school. So instead of getting an academic education, he went to a Christian Brothers technical school, where the boys were beaten. He quit school at 15 and became a butcher\u2019s assistant. Like many Bogside youths, he joined the lionized I.R.A. and was a gunman at 18.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn the late 1960s and early \u201970s, Bogside was a war zone of hatred and revenge. Stone-throwing youths were beaten by the Royal Ulster Constabulary. There were riots and protests. Two boys were shot dead by British soldiers in 1971. The Provisional I.R.A., the more militant successor to the I.R.A., launched ferocious counterattacks. Arson fires burned 100 shops, and snipers killed 26 British soldiers in Derry alone in 1971 and \u201972.\n\nMr. McGuinness was second in command of the Derry I.R.A. on Bloody Sunday, the grim day in 1972 when British troops fired on unarmed civilians staging a peaceful protest against the British practice of internment without trials. Fourteen people were killed in what became known as the Bogside Massacre.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn 1973 and 1974, Mr. McGuinness was imprisoned twice, for possession of a car filled with explosives and ammunition, and for his acknowledged membership in the illegal I.R.A.\n\nPhoto\n\nIn 1974, he married Bernadette Canning. They had four children: daughters Grainne and Fionnuala, and sons Fiachra and Emmet. There was no immediate word on his survivors.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nFrom the late 1970s to the mid-\u201980s, Mr. McGuinness was widely assumed to be the I.R.A.\u2019s chief of staff. Hundreds of people were killed by the I.R.A. in that period, including the queen\u2019s cousin Earl Mountbatten, whose fishing boat exploded off County Sligo in 1979. Many I.R.A. attacks also occurred in England, including a bombing at a Brighton hotel in 1984 that killed five people and was intended to assassinate Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and her cabinet.\n\nMr. McGuinness was accused of participating in or plotting crimes. Television documentaries and news and magazine articles linked him to murders of informers and bombings that killed scores. He and Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein\u2019s president, reportedly concluded in the early 1990s that militance was not advancing their aims. Cease-fires in 1994 and 1997 ensued, and talks led to the peace accords.\n\nMr. McGuinness was minister of education in an interim government from 1999 to 2002. Elected to the House of Commons in London in 1997, he was re-elected in 2001, 2005 and 2010 and served until 2013. A biography, \u201cMartin McGuinness: From Guns to Government,\u201d by Liam Clarke and Kathryn Johnston, appeared in 2001.\n\nAs senior officials of Northern Ireland, he and Mr. Paisley became friends of sorts. When Mr. Paisley retired in 2008, Mr. McGuinness gave him a Seamus Heaney poem. After a decade as deputy first minister, Mr. McGuinness resigned in January for health reasons, prompting a snap election in which Sinn Fein made major gains and nearly overtook the Democratic Unionists as the largest party in the regional assembly.\n\n\u201cHe retires without his dream of a united Ireland being fulfilled during his tenure,\u201d Daniel McConnell, political editor of The Irish Examiner, wrote. \u201cBut his contribution to peace on this island will be long remembered.\u201d", 
        "body2": "Thousands of people have gathered to pay tribute to Martin McGuinness at a candlelit vigil in the republican heartland of west Belfast.\n\nThe sombre event off the Falls Road happened hours after crowds in Londonderry accompanied the Sinn Fein veteran's coffin on his final journey home to his beloved Bogside neighbourhood.\n\nNorthern Ireland's former deputy first minister and an ex-IRA commander died overnight after a short illness.\n\nCrowds in Belfast held black flags on Tuesday night and sang the republican ballad \"I wish I was back home in Derry\".\n\nAddressing the vigil, priest Gary Donegan hailed Mr McGuinness's contribution to the peace process.\n\n\"Martin was a hero in life and a hero in death,\" he said.\n\nSinn Fein MP for west Belfast Paul Maskey told the crowds: \"Martin fought for justice, equality and respect. He was a patriot, a peace maker and a reconciler.\"\n\nWhile thousands of republicans lauded the legacy of the veteran politician, his death has drawn a very different response from many victims of the IRA, with some bereaved relatives not prepared to forgive him for his paramilitary past.\n\nJohn Eaglesham, whose father - a postman and part-time soldier - was shot dead by the IRA in 1978, said: \"People say about what he has done for the peace process - they seem to forget that for a very, very long time he wasn't part of the solution he was part of the problem, in fact he was the main part of the problem.\"\n\nCrowds braved snow and sleet in Mr McGuinness's native Derry to accompany his coffin, draped in an Irish tricolour, from the funeral parlour to his home in the Bogside.\n\nAnother tricolour flag flew at half-mast near the Bogside's landmark Free Derry Corner.\n\nAn emotional Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams said his long-time friend was a passionate republican who worked tirelessly for reconciliation in Ireland.\n\n\"We are very, very sad that we lost him overnight,\" he said.\n\nPrime Minister Theresa May, Irish Taoiseach Enda Kenny, ex-US president Bill Clinton and former Democratic Unionist first ministers Peter Robinson and Arlene Foster all praised Mr McGuinness's contribution to peace.\n\nKey political figures in the peace process, including former prime ministers Sir John Major and Tony Blair and ex-Irish premier Bertie Ahern, also credited his efforts to bring about an end to violence.\n\nMr McGuinness, who died from a rare heart condition, completed an extraordinary political journey from an IRA leader in Derry to sharing power and a remarkable friendship with erstwhile foe, Democratic Unionist leader Dr Ian Paisley.\n\nHe also struck up a warm relationship with the Queen, whom he praised for her contribution to peace. She is to send a personal message to Mr McGuinness's family.\n\nThe Sinn Fein stalwart is survived by his wife Bernie and four children.\n\nMr Clinton hailed Mr McGuinness's contribution to reconciliation.\n\n\"He believed in a shared future, and refused to live in the past, a lesson all of us who remain should learn and live by. May he rest in peace,\" he said.\n\nMrs May said Mr McGuinness was key to bringing the republican movement away from violence.\n\n\"While I can never condone the path he took in the earlier part of his life, Martin McGuinness ultimately played a defining role in leading the republican movement away from violence,\" she said.\n\nBut Stephen Gault, whose father Samuel died in the IRA's notorious Poppy Day bombing in Enniskillen in 1987, said he would remember Mr McGuinness only as a \"terrorist\".\n\n\"If he had been repentant, my thoughts might have been slightly different,\" he said.\n\n\"But he took to his grave proud that he served in the IRA. There was no remorse or repentance from him, even up to his death.\"\n\nMr Blair said: \"Once he became the peacemaker he became it wholeheartedly.\"\n\nMr McGuinness's last major act as a politician was to pull down the powersharing executive at Stormont when he resigned as deputy first minister in January in protest at the DUP's handling of a green energy scandal.\n\nThe move forced Mrs Foster from office. Ten days later, showing signs of physical frailty, he announced his retirement from front line politics.\n\nMrs Foster, who was caught up in an IRA bomb attack as a schoolgirl and whose father survived a republican murder bid, reached out to Mr McGuinness during the recent Stormont election campaign as his health deteriorated.\n\n\"We did of course have very different backgrounds and I think it would be wrong not to acknowledge that and the fact we did have those different life experiences,\" she said.\n\n\"But at the same time we did have a desire to see things work here at Stormont and to make devolved government work for everybody.\"\n\nMr Robinson, who served alongside Mr McGuinness for seven years, said no other republican could have done what he did while sharing power.\n\n\"Yet while I knew his past, as he knew mine, we never doubted or gave up our shared commitment to create a new and better era in Northern Ireland politics,\" he said.\n\nDuring their time in office as first and deputy first minister, Mr Paisley and Mr McGuinness earned the nickname the \"Chuckle brothers\".\n\nIan Paisley Jnr, who as a junior minister worked alongside his father and the Sinn Fein veteran during their time jointly leading the Stormont executive, said he had gone from viewing Mr McGuinness as the \"godfather of the IRA\" to considering him a personal friend.\n\n\"I think the Christian view in life is how a person's journey started is of course important, but it is how it finishes which is actually more important,\" he said.\n\nPresident of Ireland Michael D Higgins led tributes from the Irish Republic, saying Mr McGuinness's death left a gap that would be hard to fill.\n\nMr Kenny said: \"Not only did Martin come to believe that peace must prevail, he committed himself to working tirelessly to that end.\"",

I am chewing up more column inches on something that is far from a first order issue in people's daily lives.\n\nBut, I'd argue, this isn't really about changes to an obscure piece of law. It is about something more fundamental; it is about how we live together. It is the test of pluralism in a globalised world.\n\n'The return of history'\n\nWe are witnessing waves of migration; borders are flimsy if not often obsolete. We are rubbing up against each other \u2014 religions, races, cultures.\n\nInternational Relations professor Jennifer Welsh has dubbed this \"the return of history\" \u2014 a rejoinder to political scientist Francis Fukuyama's thesis that the end of the Cold War was the final victory of Western liberal democracy and \"the end of history\" \u2014 a resurgence of tribalism, nationalism and sectarianism.\n\nAll of this at a time of information revolution. It can be an incendiary mix.\n\nPhilosopher Timothy Garton Ash calls this the \"Cosmopolis\": a mixed-up, connected, world-city.\n\nIt is the 21st century version of media guru Marshall McLuhan's \"global-village\".\n\nIn this Cosmopolis there are more phones than human beings and half of humankind is connected to the internet. Mr Garton Ash says this has unleashed the, \"evils of unlimited free expression \u2026 across frontiers\".\n\nThere have been celebrated \u2014 frightening \u2014 cases. In 1989, Salman Rushdie was forced into hiding as the Iranian Ayatollah issued a fatwa \u2014 a death warrant \u2014 against the author for his work The Satanic Verses, deemed blasphemous to Islam.\n\nIn 2005, there was the Danish cartoon furore. Depictions of the prophet Muhammad in a Danish newspaper sparked global protests. I recall being in a remote town in Pakistan reporting for CNN and seeing people marching and chanting down the main street.\n\nIn 2015, the world was stunned by the attack on French satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo; terrorists opened fire killing 12 people and injuring 11 others.\n\nMr Garton Ash says we live in a world where, \"a man publishes something in one country and a man dies in another \u2026 In this disturbing way, too, we are all neighbours now\".\n\nThe ultimate check on government\n\nMr Garton Ash says this is an enormous challenge to the idea of free speech. His 2016 book, Free Speech, set out what he called 10 principles for a connected world.\n\nIt is a book well worth reading as the debate about 18C ramps up. The Government is moving to amend the law \u2014 remove the current words \"offend, insult and humiliate\" and insert instead \"harass and intimidate\".\n\nThe Government argues this will make it \"fairer\", believing the law is out of step with the standards of a \"reasonable member of the community\".\n\nThe conservative wing of the Liberal Party \u2014 albeit not alone \u2014 has led the push for change. Supporters point to recent cases here \u2014 notably the action against late cartoonist Bill Leak, who was accused of racism for his illustration depicting an Aboriginal derelict dad.\n\nThey argue the bar for offence had been set too low, leading to frivolous or vexatious cases dragged before the Human Rights Commission.\n\nIt is a contemporary twist on an old argument. Speech is central to humanity, as Mr Garton Ash says: \"It separates us from other animals and, thus far, from computers.\"\n\nFree speech can be the ultimate check on government. I have worked in countries where the government silences the people. As a reporter I have been arrested and seen other people go to jail for daring to challenge this authority.\n\nThe free trade of ideas\n\nBut what is good speech and what is bad speech? Who decides?\n\nWe all remember that lesson from childhood: sticks and stones may break my bones but names will never hurt me. In the grown-up world, of course, names can indeed hurt.\n\nMr Garton Ash says most of contemporary Western debates about free speech pivot on the issues of harm and offence.\n\nOf course free speech does not mean unlimited speech. There should be laws against inciting violence.\n\nThe right to offend, in a civil society, should also mean the exercise of good taste and judgment.\n\nBut libertarians say no-one should be free from offence and that government has no place regulating it.\n\nMr Garton Ash points out that in countries where there is heavy regulation of hate speech, hatred remains undiminished.\n\nHe argues ultimately for people to develop thicker skins. He says in our connected Cosmopolis we need more free speech, not less.\n\nHe calls for a mixture of openness and robust civility. This means tolerating beliefs, values, lifestyles; and opinions that we might find profoundly disturbing.\n\nBy guaranteeing one person's freedom of speech, we protect the speech of all.\n\nIn this way, argument can be met with counter-argument.\n\nThis is the tradition of legendary US Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, that the ultimate good is reached by the free trade of ideas.\n\nTopics: discrimination, government-and-politics, sydney-2000\n\nFirst posted",
