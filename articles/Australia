        "body0": "Video  Image The murder of Tara Brown 1 39 Take a look at the gripping details behind the brutal murder of Tara Brown   SHE had finally taken their young daughter and left him  He refused to let them go   Tara Brown was young  beautiful  popular and a devoted mother   Lionel Patea was her partner of four years  the father of the three year old daughter she doted on   He was also an ex Bandido  a one time sergeant at arms with a violent criminal past   It was a propensity for violence that would claim his estranged girlfriend s life in the most horrific of ways   On Monday  in the Brisbane Supreme Court  the 25 year old New Zealander was sentenced to life in jail after pleading guilty to her murder   On an otherwise unremarkable sunny Gold Coast Tuesday morning in September 2014  Tara Brown dropped the couple s daughter  Aria  at a daycare centre   It was the last time the smiling little girl she described as  my world  would kiss her mum goodbye   Unbeknown to the 24 year old  Patea was there waiting for her that morning   He had called the childcare centre an hour earlier to make sure Aria was booked in that day   Tara had tried to leave him before but he had not allowed it   He emptied her bank account  monitored her phone and prevented her leaving their house   The young New Zealander s mother  Natalie Hinton  said her daughter was living in fear    The monster controlled her   she told the Supreme Court on Monday  after Patea finally entered his guilty plea   In her final days  however  Tara had succeeded in breaking free   She had gone into hiding  helped by friends and domestic violence services  as she began to establish a new life for herself and Aria  a life in which she hoped to study law   The day before the fatal confrontation  Patea s lawyers had been served with interim custody papers   Patea apparently had no intention of letting his daughter go  or  at least  planned to punish her mother for leaving   On the morning of September 8  2015  just before 9am  he confronted Tara in the car park of Aria s childcare centre   She fled to the perceived safety of her black Mazda 2 but  ultimately  it was no match for Patea s Jeep four wheel drive   She sped away  Patea in hot pursuit   The estranged couple reached speeds of more than 100km hr  as the young mother desperately tried to escape   At a set of traffic lights on a busy road in Nerang  witnesses saw Patea using both fists to bash on the driver s side window of Tara s car   The terrified young woman zoomed off and made a frantic emergency call while driving    Help me  help me  help me   she screamed at the operator  only able to give Molendinar  a quiet inland Gold Coast suburb  as her location   The helpless operator was soon to hear Tara die   It was at a residential intersection where Patea finally ran her off the road   CCTV footage from a nearby home captured her small car careering at speed down an embankment and into a backyard  his Jeep then coming to a stop nearby   The camera captured Patea as he got out of his car and ran towards the wreckage  where the mother of his child lay trapped in her overturned vehicle   But he was not there to help her   Patea picked up a 7 8kg metal fire hydrant cover that he passed by    Lionel  stop  please help me   the young mother screamed  before the emergency call captured the murderous horror that unfolded in the backyard of the Macquarie Avenue home   As Tara lay  unable to escape  he inflicted 29 savage blows upon her head  the sickening thuds captured in the continuing emergency call she had made just moments before   Neighbours who heard the crash and came running to the scene   One  mistakenly believing Patea was trying to help her  smashed the car window  which unwittingly aided the ex bikie s frenzied attack   Others tried to intervene but there was no stopping the rage fuelled bashing   Lisa Kennedy told the court in a victim impact statement on Monday she remained haunted by Tara s bashing  which she said   horrified me to my core     She was screaming at me to help her from you   she said    Did I do my best  did I try hard enough    I felt like I had failed Tara    The tape recorded Tara as she kicked and screamed for help through blow after brutal blow   After the 27th thud she fell silent   Patea s murderous work was done  Tara Brown was brain dead   With the fatal blow delivered  Patea fled the scene  stealing a Gold Coast City Council ute parked nearby to make his escape   About an hour later  he surrendered himself to Coomera Police Station with self inflicted stab wounds   He was taken to the Gold Coast University Hospital  where  in a nearby ward  Tara lay unconscious   Publicly  police said her condition was critical   Privately  they knew she was already gone   Her head injuries and facial fractures were so severe  there was no possible way she could ever have survived them   The doctors kept her on life support so her family could say their final goodbyes   Tara s distraught family flew in from New Zealand   Ms Hinton described her pain at seeing her daughter in her hospital bed  with multiple fractures disfiguring her beautiful face   She was  broken   Ms Hinton said   a shadow of her beauty    On Wednesday night  the family turned Tara s life support machine off and she slipped away   Lionel Patea remained in a bed in the same hospital  under police guard  charged with attempted murder  along with domestic violence and driving offences   He had admitted to hospital staff he   did something bad to her    The attempted murder charge was upgraded to murder at his first court appearance  in Southport Magistrates Court a week later   Then 24  Patea could only mournfully nod his head when the magistrate asked him if he understood the charge was now murder   His markedly forlorn figure came in stark contrast to the frenzied  enraged man who neighbours were powerless to stop in the Molendinar backyard   Patea has remained in custody in the 18 months since  but it was not until Monday morning  just as his murder trial was about to begin  that he finally pleaded guilty to killing Tara   He could not look at the young woman s mother as she read her victim impact statement and talked about how the now four year old Aria continued to ask about her mum   Outside court  Patea s lawyer  Campbell McCallum  read a statement on behalf of his client  in which he said he knew he would never be forgiven   He acknowledged the  enormous pain  he had caused Tara s family and said his  main focus  was his daughter Aria  the little girl whose mother he had so savagely murdered    I do not wish to cause Tara s family any further pain nor delay their need for justice  I accept without reservation the punishment imposed upon me by the justice system today   Patea s statement said    I know Tara will never be forgotten  nor will I ever be forgiven    I just hope that I can today stop any further potential pain or suffering for Tara s family and I  I now live only for my daughter Aria    In sentencing Patea to life in jail  with a non parole period of 20 years on Monday  Justice Debra Mullins sought to remind him that it was Aria who would also continually serve as a reminder of what he had done    You have to live every day of your life knowing that you deprived Ms Brown of her life and your daughter of her mother   she said   Patea will be eligible for parole at the age of 44  in 2035   Anyone in need of assistance is urged to contact the national domestic violence helpline on 1800 737 732 or 1800

Matt Damon looked downcast as Jimmy started to take a few pot shots at him  Kimmel continued   I ve known Matt for a long time now  I ve known Matt so long when I first met Matt  I was the fat one  True    He then went on to tell the audience about the issues they have had  calling him  a selfish person  but then added   He did something very unselfish and I want to commend him for it    7 Matt was unable to keep a straight face as Kimmel continued to mock him  Oscars host Jimmy Kimmel 'buries the hatchet' with Matt Damon  He then went on to tell the audience that Damon could have starred in Manchester by the Sea  which he produced  but instead gave it to Casey Affleck  who won the Best Actor Oscar for the role   Kimmel joked that instead  he made a  Chinese ponytail movie   which Damon couldn t help but laugh at   7 Matt then took to the stage to with Ben Affleck but was 'played out' the orchestra     7     which was being conducted by Kimmel  Earlier in the evening  Kimmel took to his Twitter page to post a photo of himself watching Damon arriving at last night s awards and wrote   Dead man walking the red carpet   as Matt told his interviewer   He s talentless himself  Unfortunately  he s got an incredible group of writers who work for him  So I m afraid  I think I m in for it tonight    Matt Damon played off Oscars stage by Jimmy Kimmel in on going 'fued'  And a

story  The answer is that despite the big honors that black actors and black themed films took home Sunday night   after two straight years of  OscarsSoWhite controversy   the industry still has a long way to go to improve diversity throughout its ranks   This year s nominations and Sunday s victories didn t change the fact that the number of minorities in the ranks of studio executives remains woefully low  that the female director continues to be that rarest of species  this is yet another year without a woman among the directing nominees   and that the consequences for bad behavior   alleged or confirmed   still seem to go by a sliding scale based on whom your connections are or your potential at the box office   And all the celebration of the black nominees this year was tempered by what about us complaints from Asian Americans  Hispanics  women   whose nominations declined in nonacting categories compared with last year   and older Americans    The OscarsSoWhite hashtag has to be viewed as a synecdoche for  industry so white    said Franklin Leonard  the founder of The Black List  a script crowdsourcing site   If you view  OscarsSoWhite as being only about more nominations for black actors at the Oscars  then you totally missed the point  and a lot of people did miss the point    Hollywood s diversity issues  of course  aren t all that different from those of corporate America  the United States Senate or  I might add  the news industry  And to Mr  Trump s critics  Hollywood s flaws would pale in comparison to the president s moves against immigration  transgender rights and environmental protections  among other indignities   Mr  Leonard s argument is that in Hollywood  the more diverse the executive ranks  the better the chance for diversity in storytelling  As The Atlantic reports in its latest issue  his list   which polls hundreds of film executives on the best overlooked scripts they ve read   has helped push into production great screenplays  including  Slumdog Millionaire  and  Spotlight   both of which won best picture   This year s more diverse Oscar slate centered on unexpected hits like  Moonlight   about a black youth struggling with his sexual identity in abusive home and school environments    Hidden Figures   about unheralded black  female mathematicians at NASA during the space race   and  Fences   based on the August Wilson play about the generational struggles of a working class black family in Pittsburgh    Some of the nominees from those films   Octavia Spencer in  Hidden Figures   the supporting actress winner Viola Davis in  Fences  and the supporting actor winner Mahershala Ali in  Moonlight     have been in the industry forever   Mr  Leonard noted   But the rise of a new generation of filmmakers and the slow realization that diversity can result in box office results has finally given many of these actors roles that are worthy of their talents    Slow  however  is the operative word   Janice Min  a part owner of The Hollywood Reporter  told me that Hollywood still runs  like a series of private country clubs  where who s in and who s out depends on membership committees largely controlled by Hollywood power brokers who are overwhelmingly white and male   Advertisement Continue reading the main story   As any sociology major will tell you  people flock to people they know and people

Trevorrow to direct the big budget movie after another white male director in their clique  Brad Bird  said he  reminds me of me   Women in the business noticed   Ms  Min became so fed up with the lack of progress for women in Hollywood that she announced that same year that The Reporter was going to stop its rankings for women in its  Power 100  list  The ranking  she wrote  pitted women against each other when they needed to band together in the face of their many obstacles here   The magazine s current list of Hollywood s most powerful   people  with the ability to say  yes  and get a show made or a movie made   as the magazine s editorial director Matthew Belloni described it   has its share of women in the top 25  including the Universal Pictures chairwoman Donna Langley  the Fox Television Group chairwoman Dana Walden  and Oprah Winfrey   But it was otherwise short on blacks  Hispanics and Asians  The studios I reached out to last week weren t eager to speak to me about the issue  perhaps because the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission is weighing whether to bring a lawsuit against the major studios over charges the American Civil Liberties Union brought that the studios discriminated against women in hiring decisions for directors   The A C L U  pointed to research by the University of Southern California s Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism showing that women had accounted for only 1 9 percent of the directors of the top 100 grossing films in 2013 and 2014   The author of that research  Stacy L  Smith  said in an interview that part of the problem had to do with myths throughout the industry   that women don t want to direct big budget blockbusters  for instance  or that certain movies won t make money   Ms  Smith said she saw the success of  Hidden Figures  as pivotal because it would speak to Hollywood in its favorite language  cash   Here we have a film not only nominated for best picture but is financially lucrative   she said  It had generated nearly  170 million in worldwide receipts as of last week  Bloomberg reported   Advertisement Continue reading the main story  For all of its strides toward diversity  the awards season had its wrinkles  As The Times reported in January  some saw race as a factor in the way Nate Parker s film   The Birth of a Nation   lost its luster after the resurfacing of a case in which Mr  Parker was acquitted of charges that he raped a female student while at Penn State  However  Casey Affleck cruised to a best actor nomination for  Manchester by the Sea   and won  despite having settled sexual harassment allegations made against him in two civil suits  he denied the allegations    Also  this year s awards saw a second chance for Mel Gibson  whose best director nomination for  Hacksaw Ridge  came just over 10 years after he made anti Semitic and misogynist remarks during a drunken driving arrest   It was around the same time that Mr  Trump was caught on tape by  Access Hollywood  bragging about grabbing women s genitals   Mr  Gibson  of course  is an actor and director  Mr  Trump is now president and Los Angeles is such a bastion of opposition against him that it was only natural that he would inspire some political Oscar speeches this year   But Hollywood s judgment would go a lot further if it directed some of that political energy back at itself ",

and to hand back his Oscar   Oops  Watch 'Moonlight' win best picture after botched announcement  The Associated Press   It was all a stupid mix up  Somebody had given Warren Beatty the envelope for Emma Stone s best actress win in La La Land and he had showed it to co presenter Faye Dunaway with some puzzlement before she simply read out that title   Related  The highs and the lows  and one big blunder  at this year's Academy Awards  In pictures  Oscars 2017  The top red carpet looks  Barry Hertz  What we learned from Jimmy Kimmel s toothless opening monologue  But the mistake also produced the loudest and most awkward symbol of the transfer of power from old Hollywood to an industry that must reflect a more diverse America as the white guys were literally forced to hand over their prizes  After two years of the  OscarsSoWhite controversy  the 89th Academy Awards embraced African American talent   Moonlight director Barry Jenkins had made the point directly earlier in the evening when he and Tarell Alvin McCraney  the dramatist on whose play the film is based  accepted the Oscar for best adapted screenplay   Jenkins promised that both the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences and the American Civil Liberties Union would support people  who feel like there s no mirror for you  for the next four years  in a reference to Donald Trump s term as president   McCraney echoed his words  saying   This goes out to all those black and brown boys and girls and non gender conforming who don t see themselves  we re trying to show you you  and us    Those were among the most overt political statements during an evening that would have disappointed anyone who tuned in hoping that liberal Hollywood would be on fire with righteous indignation against the new president   Aside from a few predictable jabs from host Jimmy Kimmel  joking over his concern that Trump was not tweeting about the show  the references to the state of American politics were veiled beneath many passing salutes to diversity  empathy and humanity   Winning for best supporting actress in Fences  a tearful Viola Davis said that as an artist she belongs to  the only profession that celebrates what it means to live a life   and praised playwright August Wilson  from whose play Fences was adapted  as a writer  who exhumed and exalted the ordinary people    Similarly  presenting that award  British actor Mark Rylance made a few telling comments about the ways in which supporting actors actually often play in opposition to main characters and that opposing without hating seems to be something women are particularly good at   Among these more delicate notes  the largest political gesture of the evening sounded rather flat  perhaps because people could guess it would be coming  The Iranian feature The Salesman won best foreign language film and director Asghar Farhadi was not there to accept the award   He had said he would stay away to protest Trump s travel and immigration ban against citizens of Iran and six other Muslim majority countries  Instead  Iranian American businesswoman Anousheh Ansari read out a statement from Farhadi in which he denounced the ban  and the anti democratic nature of us versus them fear mongering before arguing that film transmits shared human values   Applause followed but the protest felt anti climactic   Meanwhile  Kimmel s risk free shtick got more and more clubby as he included much inside joking about his dislike of Matt Damon  Who knew  Who cared   and a gag in which a busload of supposedly awestruck tourists was unloaded into the celebrity studded auditorium   By the time Casey Affleck was picking up his Oscar for best actor  have neatly side stepped controversy over a sexual harassment suit he settled in 2010  things were getting painful  As the shambling Affleck confessed   Man  I wish I had something bigger and more meaningful to say   many viewers might have agreed heartily   Without fireworks or grandstanding or even a La La Land landslide  it was turning into a dull evening all round with Academy voters spreading the goodies around  giving both best original score and best original song to La La Land while offering best original screenplay to Manchester by the Sea and best adapted screenplay to Moonlight   The awards to Davis and Mahershala Ali of Moonlight meant that African American actors won both best supporting categories while whites  Affleck and Stone  won the best acting categories   La La Land also won cinematography and took the directing prize for Damien Chazelle  Perhaps that should have been somebody s clue that the La La Landers were in for a nasty surprise  In recent years  the Academy has often  rather illogically  split the best director and best picture prizes between two front runners   Still  in this year when the Oscars hoped to get a ratings bump from those who tuned in expecting controversy  there was nothing much to keep a tired viewer watching after 11 p m  ET  Yet if you made the mistake of turning off the TV and going to bed you would have missed the oddest Oscar moment ever as Horowitz announced   There s a mistake  Moonlight  You guys won best picture     This is not a joke   he assured the audience as Jenkins and Moonlight s producers began their move towards the stage   No  it s no joke  This time  Hollywood really does seem to have changed   Report Typo Error",
