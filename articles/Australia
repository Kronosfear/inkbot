        "body0": "On Tuesday a drug addict was sent to jail. He had gone to court and listened, fidgeting and fretting next to his bereft parents, as his lawyer argued why he should go to rehab not a cell. The magistrate, sick of excuses, said no.\n\nThe drug addict was sent to jail for an accumulation of minor offences and breaches of restraining orders. He will spend 12 months behind bars.\n\nThis was just another drug addict in just another court on just another day. In the dock stood a man in his late 30s with an escalating drug problem. Failed attempts at rehab. Tortured relationships. Restraining orders. An inability to cope with isolation and the denial of contact with his children. Finally, a frustrated court lost patience.\n\n\"Previous efforts to bring about change in \u2026 behaviour hasn't worked ... any leniency it might be suggested has been exhausted,\" the magistrate said.\n\nSHARE\n\nShare on Facebook SHARE\n\nShare on Twitter TWEET\n\nLink Sent to jail: Ben Cousins. Photo: Heather McNeill\n\nAnd so this man was sent to jail, an unremarkable case of another unremarkable drug addict. Except he wasn't.\n\nThis man's addiction was no different to any others. Yet this man was different to others. This drug addict was Ben Cousins. AFL footballer, Brownlow medallist, premiership captain, champion, drug addict and now criminal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe sense of inevitability about this descent is not unusual for someone with a two-gram-a-day ice addiction but it is the height from which he has fallen with so many around trying to catch him that marks him as different. Drugs, and now the courts, do not discriminate.\n\n\"There needs to be a general deterrent for this sort of behaviour,\" magistrate Richard Huston observed as he passed sentence.\n\nYet Ben Cousins' life could be argued to be salutary.\n\nIt certainly should be to the AFL. At the beginning of a season of self-congratulation for mega crowds, expanded markets and new women's competitions, Cousins continues to be an uncomfortable and embarrassing reminder of the AFL's stark and utter failure.\n\nYes, Cousins was ultimately responsible for what happened to him. But others were complicit. Warnings went unheeded and eyes were wilfully blind while victories were celebrated. A culture of win at any cost has underpinned the sport's most damnable moments. (See also Essendon.)\n\nSo a drug addict has gone away for a year. But his story \u2013 no matter how it now ends \u2013 is not going away.",

        "body1": "Sixers center Shawn Long, taking a shot against the Celtics on March 19, 2017, has shown he belongs in the NBA.\n\nNEW YORK - When he talked about Shawn Long, veteran Gerald Henderson got straight to the point about his 76ers teammate, who spent the bulk of his rookie season in the NBA Development League.\n\n\"He's an NBA player, man,\" Henderson said.\n\nAfter only 10 NBA games, that's obvious.\n\nThe reserve center finished with 15 points and a career-high 10 rebounds Sunday in the loss to the Indiana Pacers at Bankers Life Fieldhouse. That came two days after he finished with a career-high 18 points on 8-for-10 shooting in a victory over the Chicago Bulls at the United Center.\n\n\"He knows how to play,\" said Henderson, who is in his eighth NBA season. \"He's aggressive. He's not scared. He goes out there and plays the same way he did in the D-League.\"\n\nThe 6-foot-9 Long is averaging 7.9 points, 4.5 rebounds and 11.5 minutes as the Sixers' third-string center. He has excelled in extended minutes the last two games because Jahlil Okafor was sidelined with right knee soreness.\n\nThe Sixers (27-46) initially called Long up on a 10-day contract from their D-League affiliate, the Delaware 87ers, on March 6 to provide depth behind Okafor and Richaun Holmes. The team signed him to a partially guaranteed, three-year deal on March 16 after his 10-day contract expired.\n\nHis contract is guaranteed through the rest of the season.\n\n\"I just have to do what I do - that's just play hard,\" Long said of his role. \"I'm still learning from the schemes on defense and whatnot. But Coach has confidence in me and [is] putting me in there. So I think the thing I bring to the table is playing hard.\"\n\nBut his hard play makes an easy, fun-loving target for his teammates.\n\n\"He's done his thing,\" Henderson said with a smile. \"He's averaging a foul per minute. We tell him about it every day.\"\n\nSplitter's back\n\nThe Sixers recalled Tiago Splitter from Delaware on Monday. The team sent him to their D-League affiliate last Tuesday as part of his return-to-play protocol. The power forward/center last played in an NBA game as an Atlanta Hawk on Jan. 31, 2016, because of season-ending right hip surgery. He could make his Sixers debut in the coming days.\n\nThe team is in New York for Tuesday's game against the Brooklyn Nets at the Barclays Center. The Sixers will host the Hawks on Wednesday before road games against the Cleveland Cavaliers (Friday) and Toronto Raptors (Sunday).\n\nSplitter averaged 6.5 points, 5.5 rebounds, and 13.8 minutes in two games with the Sevens. His best outing came Saturday when he posted eight points and eight rebounds in 14 minutes against the Windy City Bulls at the Bob Carpenter Center. Splitter, 32, made 4 of 6 shots.\n\nThe Sixers acquired Splitter and a protected second-round pick from the Hawks for Ersan Ilyasova on Feb. 22. The Sixers also have the right to swap another second-rounder in June's draft.\n\nSplitter's contract expires at the conclusion of this season.\n\nTake a bow\n\nThe team will honor KIPP Lanning Square Middle School boys' basketball coach/athletic director Matt George as the Sixers Jr. NBA coach of the year in an on-court ceremony on Wednesday.\n\nTalking to Hinkie\n\nThe Sacramento Kings have received permission from Sixers managing partner Josh Harris to speak to former Sixers general manager Sam Hinkie, ESPN reported.Vlade Divac is the Kings' vice president of basketball operations and general manager.\n\nkpompey@phillynews.com\n\n@PompeyOnSixers",

        "body0": "Share on twitter\n\nShare on Google Plus Rowan Dean by The world of political depression was rocked to its core this week by news that former prime minister Julia Gillard has been appointed chairperson of mental health organisation Beyondblueties. \"Oi am deloyted to accept moi friend Jiff Kunnut's koind offer to reploice him as the moin person in Orstraya in charge of mental health,\" said a clearly deloyted, er, delighted Ms Gillard to an enrapt press conference of mental health experts. \"Normally Oi don't loik men in blue tois but in Jiff's case Oi am prepared to moik an exception.\" Ms Gillard is believed to have been hand-picked for the job due to her lengthy experience diagnosing imaginary mental disorders such as sexism and misogyny during her three-year stint as head nurse at the notorious Lakeside Lunatic Asylum in Canberra. The asylum, which is buried deep underground and can house up to several hundred patients at a time in its notorious \"Green\" and \"Red\" twin chambers, is known scathingly as Capital Punishment Hill. Critics of the institution claim that Nurse Gillard was responsible for inflicting a series of highly dubious and extremely costly research programmes upon not only unsuspecting inmates but the nation as a whole. \"The sums involved were mind-blowing,\" complained a former colleague, Dr Wayne Springsteen of 4 Surplus Row, Nambour. \"They did my head in.\"\n\nWandering daze\n\n\"It was like the lunatics had taken over my asylum,\" complained a former inmate, Kevin, a drifter of no fixed abode. \"Which is exactly what she did. I've been wandering around in a daze ever since and I'm incapable of landing even the most menial of jobs. They won't even let me scrub the dunnies at the UN.\" But Nurse Ratshit remains unapologetic: \"Moi good friend Kevin was a dangerous psoichopath suffering from severe narcissism with delusions of being the Proim Minister of Orstraya which was of course moi job. Oi had no choice other than to get Little Sammy, Smurky Burky and Fat Howzie to pin him down so Oi could perform an emergency lobotomy on his spoinal chord with the sharpest knoife Oi could foind.\" Nurse Gillard remains convinced that her controversial approach to mind control allowed an entire generation of women and young girls to discover they were inflicted with severe bouts of non-existent male oppression. \"These girls are now so oppressed they feel they have no choice other than to go and jump off the Wage Gap,\" explained one expert.\n\n\"Oi clearly established through moi extensive research programme that when a man in a blue toi looks at his watch when Oi am spoiking then he is clearly suffering from acute misogyny,\" explained Ms Gillard to a jubilant crowd of nutcases at the Sydney Opera House. \"And Oi will not be lectured to about sexism and misogyny boi this man, Oi will not. And Oi sincereloi hope that Mr Rabbit has a poice of paper and is wroiting out his own job prescription,\" she added, to thunderous applause from a group of wailing, hysterical feminists. Moi Story However, other experts believe that evidence published in her autobiography Moi Story suggests that Nurse Gillard herself suffered from repeat bouts of paranoia and self-delusion, indulging in extreme flights of fancy where she imagined herself to be a happily married woman living in a quaint cottage in Canberra charmingly called \"The Lodge\" with her own private hairdresser/boyfriend ensconced in a man shed at the bottom of the garden. \"It was all part of the fantasy,\" claims one psychologist. \"She even imagined she would be Headmistress of the Entire World if she gave enough taxpayers' dollars to the Clinton Foundation.\" CT scans are believed to indicate that the Left side of Nurse Gillard's brain is abnormally enlarged, likely to have been brought on through years of unhealthy exposure to student undergraduate politics and hardcore union affiliations. \"On occasions, those close to Nurse Gillard could be spotted in the middle of the night hiding her medication in a brown paper bag and burying it in the garden,\" admitted her former boyfriend.",

I know what I'm looking for. That's why I'm still single at 31. It's because I want that, and I'll find it.\"\n\nAndy looked about to cry throughout her entire speech and finally said, \"That's it, then?\"\n\nArticle continues below...\n\n\"I wasn't expecting that to happen,\" he told the cameras. \"I knew there was problems, but I wasn't expecting that to happen. I don't think she wanted to make that decision, but she felt it was the right thing to do. And I want to support her on all levels.\"\n\n\"I feel so s---,\" she sobbed into her hand.\n\nAnd what did Andy do? He grabbed her by the hand, led her away, and put his arm around her to console her while they sat and mourned the end of their relationship on a dock.\n\n\"I'm good at being alone,\" he told her, rubbing her back.\n\nAnd that's where I lost it.\n\nTheir breakup hurt the most because it felt the most real, the most raw.\n\nIf Jesse and Michelle had met in the real world, let's be honest, things wouldn't have gone past a first date.\n\nWith Sean and Susan, their constant smiles and ongoing deep connection signal this wasn't quite as devastating for them to go through as it was for us to watch.\n\nBut with Andy and Vanessa, we saw the very real pit-of-your-stomach horror that comes with wanting desperately to make things work but ultimately acknowledging they can't.\n\nUnlike the other couples, they didn't have pre-written vow cards to read from or the simple ease of writing \"Stay\" or \"Leave\" on a piece of paper.\n\nAndy and Vanessa's confessions were candid \u2013 and so visceral I almost had to look away. Almost.\n\nVanessa has gotten a lot of flak for her constant complaining about Andy \u2013 but I get it. She's reached a point in her life where she REALLY wants to settle down and she, therefore, desperately wanted to make this relationship work despite its obvious issues.\n\nOn paper, Andy's a great guy, and they had chemistry from the start. But for Vanessa, a communicative partner was a must. It's unfair to ask her to be in a relationship where her partner isn't reciprocating her verbal needs just as it's unfair to ask Andy to completely change his personality.\n\nInstead of forcing a dynamic that would only make them resent each other later, she did the right thing by breaking up with him now \u2014 no matter how much it hurt to do (or us to watch).\n\nCatch a new episode of Married At First Sight Sunday night on Nine (and tweet me your thoughts @AshleyySpencer ).

        "body0": "Sydney (AFP) - Perth-based outfit Western Force on Tuesday dismissed concerns they face the axe from the troubled Super Rugby competition after a report suggested they will be scrapped in a revamped format.\n\nSuper Rugby Organisers SANZAAR are grappling with a way forward for the convoluted 18-team, five-nation Southern hemisphere championship and announced some three weeks ago that a shake-up was imminent.\n\nSince then it has been mute on the issue.\n\nIn the absence of any decisions, speculation has been rife that it will be trimmed back to 15 clubs, with South Africa losing two of its six teams and Australia cutting one of five.\n\nSydney's Daily Telegraph stated Tuesday that Western Force, which was founded in 2005, would be chopped rather than the ACT Brumbies or Melbourne Rebels. The NSW Waratahs and Queensland Reds are widely considered safe.\n\nBut Force chief executive Mark Sinderberry rejected this. \"The reports that are coming out of Sydney at the moment are totally false,\" he told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.\n\n\"Two-and-a-half weeks ago we had a telephone link up with the Australian Rugby Union and at that time made very clear that there was a number of factors to be considered and there hadn't been any decisions made and we've had no further correspondence since then.\"\n\nSinderberry was adamant Western Force was not facing the axe. \"It's not a case of whether they should or not, at all. They will survive,\" he said.\n\nAustralian Rugby Union chief Bill Pulver said no decisions had been taken. \"At this point, there has been no determination on the future competition format or the teams involved in the competition,\" he said in a statement.\n\n\"We also wish to confirm for the public record that no decision has been taken on the removal of one of Australia's Super Rugby teams.\"\n\nThe competition currently straddles 17 time zones and four continents, resulting in complaints of lopsided contests, taxing travel times and a fragmented conference system seen as too confusing for fans.\n\nProblems intensified in 2016, when Super Rugby expanded from 15 teams to 18 with the introduction of Japanese franchise Sunwolves who are co-based in Tokyo and Singapore, Argentina's Jaguares and South Africa's Southern Kings.",

But we had a number of young guys step up, and they got some good experience. Going forward, it's only going to be good for us.\"\n\nThe Force had to defend grimly in the opening half as the Crusaders unleashed wave after wave of attack.\n\nBy the 30-minute mark, the Crusaders had already scored four tries, with the Force making more than 60 tackles in that period.\n\nAlthough the Crusaders dominated much of the first half, the Force enjoyed some good moments.\n\nWinger Alex Newsome scored a 60m try in the 18th minute when he picked off a pass from Crusaders lock Matt Todd and sprinted to the line.\n\nAnd just moments after the half-time buzzer, Force winger Chance Peni twisted and turned his way in a tackle to ground the ball on the line.\n\nEven with Peni's try, the Force still trailed 28-17 at half-time, but it gave them a slither of hope of pulling off an upset.\n\nHowever, with some TMO calls going against them and Naisarani yellow carded despite keeping his feet at the ruck, the Force were unable to keep pace in the high-scoring affair.\n\nAAP",

Thirty thousand people were evacuated from Cairns.\n\nEarlier, BOM forecaster Brett Harrison said the cyclone could develop into a Category 5 system.\n\n\u201cAt this stage we can\u2019t rule out a category five system during the coming hours,\u201d Mr Harrison told ABC News.\n\n\u201cBut Category 4 \u2014 it\u2019s a very intense system at the moment \u2014 we are expecting wind gusts near the centre of up to 275km/h.\u201d",

(AAP)\n\nRecovery teams are bracing for the full extent of devastation caused by Cyclone Debbie following a day of buffeting winds on the north Queensland coast.\n\nThe full extent of the ferocious Cyclone Debbie's destruction won't be known until emergency teams begin a massive clean-up effort in its north Queensland disaster zone.\n\nThe clean up for the worst cyclone to hit the state since Yasi in 2011 will start at first light on Wednesday, with Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk predicting \"shock and awe\" across the Whitsunday region.\n\nThe storm and its 260 km/h winds downed trees, stripped buildings and left shorelines swamped after making landfall as a category four storm near Airlie Beach at midday on Tuesday.\n\nThere are now concerns for the 1500 residents of Collinsville, who have never encountered a cyclone of Debbie's force.\n\nMs Palaszczuk has warned the state will be dealing with the impact of the \"scary\" cyclone for the next three to five days as it moved down the coast.\n\n\"I think there is going to be a lot of shock and awe in the morning,\" she told Ten News, later admitting even she was \"bracing\" for dawn.\n\nWinds were so severe a man, believed to be aged in his 60s, was badly injured after a wall collapsed on him in Proserpine.\n\nPictures shared on social media by Airlie Beach locals showed backyards strewn with tree branches, damaged cars and toppled fences.\n\nOne person said a neighbour's caravan \"exploded\" and sent fragments through their roof, while another resident said she had a \"mini-cyclone\" in her bedroom after a double-glass window blew in.\n\nProserpine-based Whitsundays councillor John Collins said the initial winds sounded \"like a jumbo jet is parked on my roof\".\n\n\"I've been through a few cyclones that are quick and nasty but this one is going to go all day,\" he told AAP.\n\n\"This is going to be a terrible disaster when it is all over and done with.\"\n\nThe Australian Defence Force has mobilised soldiers, vehicles, aircraft and other resources to respond to Debbie, which the Insurance Council of Australia has declared a \"catastrophe\".\n\nPrime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said the ADF pre-deployment was the largest of its kind in advance of a natural disaster.\n\nState Recovery Co-ordinator Brigadier Chris Field, who co-ordinated clean-up efforts after Yasi, said the army would be well suited to deal with the aftermath of the disaster.\n\n\"The engineering capabilities that the Australian Defence Force have are really designed to clear debris and get particularly roads open so that the community can go about their business,\" Brigadier Field told reporters in Townsville.\n\nMeanwhile, Police Commissioner Ian Stewart said the state needed to brace for reports of injuries, if not deaths.\n\nHe urged anyone tempted to \"sight see\" after Debbie's wrath to stay inside instead.\n\nThe premier also had strong words for those spotted boogie-boarding in seas churned up by the dangerous weather, declaring: \"I was absolutely appalled\".\n\nThere are also serious concerns for the region's 2017 sugar cane crop which is estimated at $1.1 billion.\n\nThe storm earlier pounded the Whitsunday Islands, with gusts of 263 km/h recorded at Hamilton Island while the jetty at Daydream Island appeared to have washed away.\n\nMore than 48,000 homes were without power across the Bowen, Mackay and Whitsunday regions and more than 400 schools and childcare centres closed.\n\nForecasters are also warning people to remain vigilant about damaging deluges following the cyclone, with significant rain expected down the coast towards the state's southeast.\n\nIt was downgraded to a category three cyclone just after 3pm but strong winds continued to lash Airlie Beach, Proserpine and Bowen later in the afternoon.\n\nBy 7pm, Debbie was a category two system tracking west southwest.\n\nFederal Justice Minister Michael Keenan and Queensland Police, Fire and Emergency Services Minister Mark Ryan have also announced disaster assistance, provided through the jointly funded Commonwealth-State Natural Disaster Relief and Recovery Arrangements (NDRRA).",
