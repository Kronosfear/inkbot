chiefly relieved to see Todd Goldstein  ankle   Robbie Tarrant  back   Scott Thompson  adductor  and Majak Daw play their first games of 2017 and emerge unscathed   Meanwhile Hawthorn had its first glimpse of its three boom recruits Tom Mitchell  Jaeger O'Meara and Ty Vickery playing together on Sunday and Hawks fans would have loved what they saw in the 0 13 17  95  to 0 11 8  74  result   Full match coverage and stats  Midfielders O'Meara  recruited from Gold Coast  and Mitchell  Sydney  were both prime movers for the Hawks against North  with O'Meara's run and contested work particularly impressive  while he added a brilliant goal in the second quarter with an around the body set shot   And former Richmond spearhead Vickery presented well in the Hawks' forward line  kicking two goals  the second coming after a strong pack mark   14 disposals in just over a quarter and now this  Jaeger O'Meara is tearing it up    JLTSeries pic twitter com eqjOcjushW   AFL   AFL  February 26  2017  Mitchell was making his club debut for Hawthorn after missing last week's win over Geelong and looked at home in the Hawks' midfield set ups   O'Meara and Mitchell will be vital to the Hawks' hopes of staying in the top four this season after the exits of four time premiership midfielders Sam Mitchell and Jordan Lewis at the end of last season   Jaeger firms for round one after fine showing  The Hawks will also look to Vickery to fill the forward ruck role performed so ably by David Hale from 2011 15   Hawthorn assistant Cam Bruce  who filled in as the Hawks senior coach on Sunday  was pleased with the performances of O'Meara  Mitchell and Vickery but said all three had room for improvement    It's a good start  they were solid today  They've still got areas we would like them to get better at  and they're building relationships with a group of players that they've just started playing with   Bruce said   The Kangaroos made the most of the return to their spiritual home ground   the club last played an official game at Arden Street in 1985   attacking the contest with vigour from the opening bounce   Goldstein  who carried the Roos' duties with his usual aplomb  sent a scare through North fans when he went into North's rooms midway through the third quarter  but it turned out he needed nothing more than a toilet break   Braydon Preuss shared North's ruck duties with Goldstein and continued his push for a premiership season debut  Significantly  Preuss provided a strong target when resting forward  kicking three goals  showing he is developing the forward nous to be considered as a support ruckman behind Goldstein   North also had its first look at last year's No 12 draft pick  Jy Simpkin  with the young forward showing glimpses of the class that has him in contention for a round one debut   Former Magpie Marley Williams and ex Bulldog Nathan Hrovat also advanced their claims on round one spots with strong performances in defence and attack respectively   North assistant coach Josh Drummond  who assumed the Roos' senior coaching reins for Sunday's game  was  really proud  of his team's performance but acknowledged the successful returns of Goldstein  Tarrant  Thompson and Daw were more significant    It was a big day for the club playing our first game here for over 30 years  I thought they handled the occasion well and put in a strong performance   Drummond said    The win is great   but at the end of the day we're all building for round one so it was a key stepping stone for those guys just gaining some match fitness and building for West Coast in round one    The running game pays off for  NMFCOfficial    JLTSeries pic twitter com 147WUQntGC   AFL   AFL  February 26  2017  Senior Hawks Luke Hodge  Luke Breust and Jack Gunston played their opening games of 2017  and showed little rust   On a warm sunny day at Arden Street  the game started at a frantic pace with both teams attacking the ball fiercely   North made most of the running early  kicking three of the first four goals  but Hawthorn responded with the final two majors of the first quarter to go into quarter time just two points down   The second quarter was a term of two halves  The Hawks dominated early  kicking three unanswered goals to get out to an 18 point lead   The Roos then hit back with three unanswered goals of their own to go into half time with a three point lead  which should have been bigger with Ben Cunnington missing two easy set shots on goal   North carried that momentum into the third term  kicking the opening two goals  but the Hawks hit back with the next two  the first coming via Vickery after a strong pack mark   The Roos took a nine point lead into three quarter time and the Hawks couldn't get any closer during the final term  with the home team cruising to a 21 point win   The famous elephant on the field was re enacted during Sunday's match  Picture  AFL Photos  WHAT WE LEARNED  North Melbourne  Most importantly  key players Todd Goldstein  ankle   Robbie Tarrant  back  and Scott Thompson  adductor   and emerging forward Majak Daw  knee  should be ready for round one  averting what could have been an injury crisis for the Roos  Braydon Preuss is also emerging as a genuine contender to play in the same team as Goldstein  as his forward work continues to improve   Hawthorn  The Hawks' hopes of defying football gravity and staying in the top four are by no means delusional  There will be life in the Hawks' midfield after Sam Mitchell's and Jordan Lewis' departures  with Jaeger O'Meara and Tom Mitchell outstanding against the Roos  And maligned former Tiger Ty Vickery's performance was extremely encouraging  suggesting he will a handy pick up in attack and as a pinch hitting ruckman   NEW FACES  North Melbourne  Roos fans got their first look at Jy Simpkin  pick No 12 in last year's NAB AFL Draft  The forward came on in the second quarter and showed glimpses of his class  hitting Kayne Turner in attack with a nicely weighted pass and then in the third quarter he cleverly spun out of trouble on the wing  Former Bulldog Nathan Hrovat and rookie Cameron Zurhaar were lively in attack  Zurhaar set up Hrovat for North's first goal with a deft pass  while Hrovat set up North's second a minute later hitting Trent Dumont inside the Roos' forward 50  Zurhaar kicked a goal himself midway through second term  Ex Magpie Marley Williams again looked at home on North's backline and looks on track for a round one berth   Hawthorn  Former Sun O'Meara was outstanding through the midfield  the highlight of his day came early in the second term  when he converted with a brilliant curling set shot  Ex Swan Mitchell also impressed in his club debut with his contested work at stoppages  while former Tiger Vickery presented well enough again in attack to suggest he'll prove an astute acquisition for the Hawks   NEXT UP  Both teams have a week off before they hit the road for their final JLT

        "body1": "Steve O Keefe was deemed the weakest of Australian bowlers by Shane Warne   Source Reuters  Steve O Keefe was deemed the weakest of Australian bowlers by Shane Warne   Source Reuters   STEPHEN O KEEFE is closing in on 200 days since his last beer  His last  cold one  had landed him in big trouble last August when he was embroiled in a boozy spat at Manly s Steyne Hotel where he allegedly even abused a few policemen  He was not only fined  10 000 for his actions by Cricket Australia and sent to counselling  O Keefe also received a final ultimatum to shape in or ship out from chief selector Rod Marsh   It was a difficult time for him  who d just returned prematurely from a much awaited maiden tour to the subcontinent after injuring himself in Sri Lanka  His career was at the crossroads  He immediately decided to go cold turkey for the rest of the summer and as time wore on even stopped counting the days   On Friday  the 32 year old relatively unknown left arm spinner serving a self imposed alcohol ban lifted Aussie spirits on a dry owing to it being Mahashivratri day and a drier pitch in Pune  Playing in only his fourth Test  he ran through the Indians in a mere 25 balls  finishing with 6 35  including three wickets in a single over and a spell which read 4 1 1 5 6  Along the way  he didn t just surprise the Indians but a majority of them back home  including Shane Warne  who was incidentally in the commentary box at the MCA Stadium  Warne has repeatedly questioned the inclusion of O Keefe in the Test squad in the past saying that he hopes to see him actually spin the ball rather than stick to bowling flat and defensively  He d also called O Keefe the  weakest  of the Aussie bowlers even on Friday on Star Sports a few minutes before the spinner commenced his demolition job   But it s a perception issue that O Keefe has had to deal with pretty much throughout his career  To an extent it s not misplaced considering that he does indeed thrive on being a nagging presence with the ball rather than trying to deceive or trick the batsmen out  In the past he s had to deal with much harsher and more scathing reviews about his bowling from Terry Jenner  the man who discovered Warne   He had even likened his stint at the academy under Jenner to the movie Whiplash  recalling Jenner having never been impressed with anything he bowled and rather looking at it with disgust  Though he was affected by the constant rebuttals early on  they soon turned into  white noise  for O Keefe as he then chose to instead stick to his own strengths and be comfortable in his own skin  It s a line he would repeat on Friday following his awe inspiring performance  The irony though is that O Keefe  who has completed a dozen years of first class cricket  has still remained the most successful spinner in the Sheffield Shield over the last few seasons averaging in the mid twenties  which these days is a rarity for a spinner Down Under  His Test chances were far and few in between with his long standing sparring partner Nathan Lyon having established himself as a premier spinner   And as O Keefe revealed here  there were fears that his change might have come and gone for good to the subcontinent  especially after the injury in Sri Lanka   I always though Indian tour was there  but it was almost unreachable   he said   There s also some trivia attached with O Keefe s Test career as he is the first ever Malaysian born cricketer to don the Baggy Green  He spent the first four years of his life there owing to his father being in the Air Force  His mother  Jann  therefore had to take over the responsibility of young Stephen and his cricket once the family moved to Australia sans the father  And she did so by working all night as a nurse but still never fail to chauffeur her son to the cricket ground during the day  O Keefe even recalled some of those rides in an interview to The Guardian recently    She used to work as a night duty Nurse in the emergency department before driving me 65 kilometres from Richmond to the SCG for under 17s training   O Keefe says   Our blue Ford Laser didn t have air conditioning  and I d be kicking the back seat blaming her for my terrible net  She d had zero sleep and had probably dealt with drunks all night  and I was worried about being dehydrated  She made incredible sacrifices for me   he had said   O Keefe  however  had spoken to cricket com au recently about his own experiences of chauffeuring a certain cricketer around Sydney a few years ago  Someone he unfortunately didn t get the opportunity to bowl   About six years ago when Virat Kohli was at the academy and a no name  I used to drive him around so that he could ASICS shoes  So since I looked after him a bit there  I m sure he owns a shoe factory now  so hopefully I could get a pair of shoes from him   he d said   O Keefe might have proven a lot of people wrong here  but he s not looking too far ahead yet and was even humble enough to call himself  lucky   To put things in perspective  the last Australian left arm spinner to take six wickets in an innings in India was Michael C0larke in his very first series  And that was on a dubious wicket at the Wankhede Stadium a dozen years ago  O Keefe has a long way to go before he can actually cement his place for good in this Australian team  O Keefe had said not long back that he wasn t sure when he would have his next beer  Today wouldn t be a bad day for it ", 
        "body0": "NEW DELHI  In January  Cricket Australia announced that the left arm spin bowler Steve O'Keefe was being pulled out of the Big Bash League to focus on his preparation for the upcoming four Test tour of India  The 31 year old had just completed a successful return to Test cricket with final day figures of 3 53 helping beat Pakistan by 220 runs and complete a 3 0 sweep This was a big step for two reasons  one  the value that the selectors and team management deem in O'Keefe and two  the challenge that lie ahead in India  where South Africa  New Zealand and England have all been whitewashed over the past 13 months  And  not to forget  the fact that Australia have lost nine Test matches in a row in Asia dating back to the tour of India in early 2013  In this dreadful run  they have lost four Tests to India  two to Pakistan in the UAE and three in Sri Lanka O'Keefe has a history of injuries  and in the second half of 2016 found himself repeatedly out of luck  He went to Sri Lanka in the summer of 2016 as an integral part of the Test team's plans  but suffered a torn hamstring during the second innings of the first match in Palleleke and was sent home  Back in Australia  playing for Manly Warringa in round one of the Sydney Premier Cricket tournament  O'Keefe broke a finger when going for a catch and was ruled out of New South Wales' successful title defence of the One Day Cup  Also during this time  O'Keefe was involved in a drunken incident in Sydney and fined AUS 10 000 He only returned to first class cricket in the first week of November  taking eight wickets for NSW against Western Australia in the Sheffield Shield  In December  O'Keefe was primed for a Test recall against Pakistan in Adelaide but was again sidelined when he picked up a low grade calf injury during a Shield game  The recall eventually came for the New Year's Test at the SCG  and four wickets in a big win pitchforked O'Keefe into the fray for the tour of India It was then that O'Keefe chose to withdraw from Sydney Sixers' squad during the BBL in order to fine tune his body and mind to the tough challenges that lay ahead in India  The decision was not unanimously accepted  but O'Keefe was certain about what he needed to do and CA backed him  It was  in his own words  a last chance to stay relevant as a Test cricketer Swearing off alcohol and excluding himself from the BBL have proven excellent choices by the left arm spinner  who ransacked India with 12 wickets in Pune  He is now the proud holder of the third best figures by an overseas bowler on Indian soil  the best by an Australian left arm spinner ever and the most economical 12 wicket hail in Test history  His success came through diligence   during the lunch break on day two  O'Keefe skipped the food and bowled to Australia's spin consultant S Sriram   and accuracy and an ability to flummox India's batsmen with the deliveries that didn't turn Twelve wickets in your first Test in India  when few had singled you out because Nathan Lyon  the most capped overseas offspinner in Asia  was your team's frontline spinner  Getting a surface that turned from the outset worked wonderfully for O'Keefe  a bowler who appears content to plug away with minimal variations  It was the nagging consistency of his line  length and sliders that made him such a constant threat O'Keefe's performance in Pune is stunning because of the manner in which he rattled India's batting twice  taking the wickets of Ajinkya Rahane  twice   Wriddhiman Saha  twice   Murali Vijay Cheteshwar Pujara and Virat Kohli   who of all batsmen was bowled in the second innings when shouldering arms  That wicket summed up  perhaps  the manner in which the No 1 Test team undervalued O'Keefe  whose tally before Pune was 14 wickets in four Tests  Kohli  with four double centuries in four successive series  stared quizzically at the surface after he had his off stump knocked back  As if the pitch had demons in it  and not that O'Keefe was capable of producing a delivery to undo him Kohli  after 333 run loss that snapped India's unbeaten home streak at 20  level with the existing record  has termed it the wake up call that his team needed  That dismissal to O'Keefe was also a wake up call for India's captain  but the bigger picture for India is how their batsmen all failed to adapt on a surface on which the ball spun sharply from day one and the way their spinners were out bowled by Australia The Pune pitch assisted turn sharply from the second morning  was not a raging turner like what South Africa faced in 2015  Totals of 105 and 107 are shocking  but then Steven Smith 's 109 also came on the same surface  When you see the context of this innings  given the amount the pitch turned and how early in the piece it did so  Smith's hundred ranks as one of the best by an overseas batsman in India And yet none of India's dismissals in their first innings had anything to do with the pitch  In the second  Ravindra Jadeja got one that stayed low and KL Rahul one that spun in sharply  but he was so far back in his crease that his choice of short was always high risk  Glaringly  India's batsmen came undone against O'Keefe's lack of turn  The arm balls did for Vijay  Pujara  Kohli  the sliders for Saha and R Ashwin  Where was the turn  Where was the dodgy pitch This was smart  accurate and probing bowling against very uncertain batting  Like in Mumbai in 2012  India have been left stunned by two overseas spinners  This was a performance  led by O'Keefe and Smith and Lyon  based on exceptional performance and a bold restating of this team's self belief  Australia are ranked No 2 for a reason  let's not forget  England were fourth when they landed in India  New Zealand fifth and Bangladesh ninth  The difference in skills and belief is all too evident And so Australia  written off by many despite being their status in Tests  now have a 1 0 lead with three to play  They came to India to win  and thanks to O'Keefe's dream match they believe even more that a series victory   Australia's last was in 2004   is a definitely reality  India have been warned  and O'Keefe is now the focus ",

sexually abused by Robert Xie  her killer uncle  Courtesy  Seven  THE sole survivor of one of Australia s worst family murders has spoken about how her grief was compounded when she inadvertently moved in with   and was sexually abused by   her parents  killer   Brenda Lin refused to believe her uncle  Robert Xie  could have slaughtered her mum  dad  aunt and two brothers    There are bad people in the world  but your family s not one of them  I knew he didn t do it because he s family   she said on Channel 7 s Sunday Night   But Ms Lin s high school principal said she was suspicious when she witnessed Xie  53  bringing her pupil to tears following the deaths  She  just got a gut feeling he was dangerous    Breaking down  Ms Lin said she would  give anything  to have her loving family back   Ms Lin was on a school trip to New Caledonia when her uncle executed a bloody and brutal massacre in the dead of night in July  2009   Earlier this month  Xie  53  was sentenced to five life sentences for the murders  He will never be released from jail   After three years of hearings  and four Supreme Court trials  Xie was found guilty of murdering his brother in law Norman Min Lin  45  Mr Lin s wife Yun Li Lily Lin  43  her sister Irene Yin Yun Bin  39  and the Lins  two young boys Henry  12  and Terry  9   He let himself into their North Epping home and bashed them to death with a hammer like object   The killings were so efficient that most of the family members died within moments as they slept  That is apart from the youngest  Terry  who is thought to have been aware of his killer and may have struggled  given the sheer amount of blows the child received   The court was told police were greeted by a scene   awash with blood    The Crown said Xie was fuelled by jealousy of the Lin family  They ran a successful newsagency  but Xie s business ventures had ended in failure  He was angry about what he perceived as his lowly status within the family   However  another motive raised by the Crown was that he deliberately picked a time when Ms Lin would be away so  with her family gone  he could sexually abuse her once she was under his roof   Ms Lin told Sunday Night s Melissa Doyle that she is still racked by the pain of not telling her father how much she treasured him the last time they were together   At the school gates  before her trip away  other kids were hugging their parents    A lot of them were in tears and I was trying to be  a  cool teenager  and was thinking   You know  you guys are just being ridiculous     So  my dad stood next to me and we sort of stood there awkwardly   she said    And that s the last time I saw him      I didn t get to say thank you for being an amazing father or     tell him I loved him    Her mum was  very  very loving   she said  Henry was someone everyone automatically wanted to be friends with and Terry would follow his  big  bossy sister   around everywhere   News of the deaths broke when Ms Lin was overseas  A friend sent her a link to the story    It had a photo of my house  I didn t believe it   I said  that s not possible  It s someone else    She quickly returned to Australia    As soon as I saw my aunt  she was crying as well  That s when I knew it was all real    Ms Lin   having nowhere else to go   moved into the Xie family home   Far from a sanctuary from the pain  the horror only got worse  She told the NSW Supreme Court trial that Xie sexually assaulted her on a number of occasions when she moved in  She also gave evidence of instances of inappropriate touching before the killings   Susan Bridge  her high school principal  saw Xie at the school with Ms Lin and could sense something was not right  She eventually persuaded her to get a lawyer    He was so physically close to her  speaking loudly  rapidly in Chinese    Brenda  with her head down  tears falling down  It was clear that he was trying to get her to agree to something    I told my husband  I think I ve spent all day with a murderer  I just got a gut feeling he was dangerous and I was very worried for Brenda s safety   she said    How did she know   said Ms Lin  who at the time still couldn t see why he would do such a crime    He was definitely not a murderer in my eyes  He was just an uncle  a family guy     You re brought up being told that your family are amazing people   she told Doyle    There are bad people in the world but your family s definitely not one of them   Xie was  someone that I trusted    Eventually  police moved in on Xie    He was surprised to have the police arrive at his door  It was an absolute shock   Ms Lin said   She no longer looks up to her uncle  But facing up to what he did to her  even after he killed her family  is still raw and hard   Asked if she was sexually abused by her uncle  she told Doyle   Yes  he did  It s something that at this point I haven t quite processed properly    And his desire to continue that abuse being one of the reasons behind the murders    I did think  is something like this enough to kill five people  I don t think I ever will be sure why he did what he did    Ms Lin fought back tears   I d give anything to have my family back    Kathy Lin  Ms Lin s aunt and Xie s wife  is sticking by her husband    She used to send me messages saying that he was innocent  he was being framed by the police   said Ms Lin    I hope  one day  she can realise that all I did was tell the truth    She s better off not with him    At Xie  sentencing  Justice Elizabeth Fullerton praised Ms Lin    I acknowledge the profound grief she has suffered and continues to suffer  I also commend her for her strength and dignity  and her courage as she faces the future without parents  siblings or a loving aunt  ",

distressing in light of the recently revealed sexual motive for the slayings   Earlier this week  it was reported that prosecutors argued Xie killed Ms Lin's parents  brothers and aunt so that he

        "body1": "Feb 24  2017  Chicago  IL  USA  Phoenix Suns guard Devin Booker  1  and Chicago Bulls forward Nikola Mirotic  44  chase a loose ball during the second half at the United Center  The Bulls won 128 121  Mandatory Credit  David Banks USA TODAY Sports  If you re a real Suns fan  you want them to lose  right  Losing now makes you a winner later  so it s okay right   VS  1 2 3 4 OT1 T Suns 25 29 25 29 13 121 Bulls 24 28 28 28 20 128  Outscored by 20 points over the prior 9 minutes and 40 seconds  and with only several seconds left in a game that the Suns appeared to have had in the bag only minutes before  the Purple Gang from Phoenix found themselves down by two with the ball and a chance to win or tie   Devin Booker was pegged as the man to win the game  and with two seconds left he lifted up a three point attempt while being inexplicably fouled by Dwayne Wade awarding Booker with three free tosses and the chance to ice a victory   First free throw  nailed it   Booker looked absolutely calm and ready to win the game   Second free throw  nailed it   The game e is now tied  Booker looked like he had ice in his veins  Nothing and no one was going to prevent him from winning this game   Third free throw  off the right side of the rim  Booker held his shooting pose watching helplessly as Len battled to tap the ball back in the hoop but as was unable to grab control before the final buzzer sounded  Suns and Bulls were headed to overtime   Emotionally  Booker lost it  With an opportunity to win the game  he missed the final free throw and his competitive juices overflowed  His jersey was ripped from his shorts  He screamed at himself for missing the final free throw  He slammed the ground with his hands in desperate emotional pain  knowing that that free throw was the difference between certain victory and possible defeat   In overtime the Suns were unable to regain their composure  and the Bulls  who had practically been playing from behind the entire game   suddenly found their stride and managed to put the intentionally depleted Suns out of their misery  outscoring Phoenix 20 13 in the final five minutes  ensnaring victory from the jaws of defeat   Suns fans were surely disappointed to see the Suns lose in such a fashion  And yet  in the back of all of our minds is the knowledge that a loss  in a completely backwards sense  is a win  A loss in the win loss column  means more ping pong balls in this summer s NBA Draft Lottery  meaning long term success is nigh   This game was also the first for the Suns without P J  Tucker  the former defensive heart and soul  of this team  And in the final minutes of the fourth quarter  when Chicago needed him the most  the previously quiet Jimmy Butler suddenly came alive and pulled the Bulls back into contention late  ultimately leading them to overtime  and eventually victory  Guarding Butler late was Eric Bledsoe  who while still a solid defender himself  is nowhere near the height  size  nor shares the ferocity  of Tucker   This truly was a game that Tucker could have helped to win  and that the Suns lost  although they needed to lose  without him   Boy this tank talk is difficult and occasionally confusing    With the loss  the Suns guaranteed their continuance of a lack of a three game winning streak  the longest the team has gone without one in franchise history  Phoenix has 24 games remaining in the regular season  with eleven games against Eastern Conference opponents  With the loss the Suns fell to 3 3 on the season in overtime games  and 11 8 against the Eastern Conference   Intentionally hamstrung tonight with the benching of Tyson Chandler and Brandon Knight allowing the younger players as much regular rotational time as possible  including Alan Williams and Derrick Jones Jr    the Suns are moving forward with their younger players as much as possible  even at the detriment of the veterans on the roster  and the possibility that their talent and wisdom can help record a few more victories   Booker led all scorers with 27 points finishing 10 21 from the floor and 2 4 from beyond the arc  He also recorded 2 steals  tied for the most he has had in a game since he recorded 3 steals against Utah on New Years Eve   Playing only 14 minutes  but will now presumably receive significant playing time with the benching of Chandler  Alan Williams scored 16 points on 8 9 shooting  converting his first 8 attempts on the night  He hampered himself though by recording 5 fouls  all fairly quickly   T J  Warren and Marquese Chriss each scored 17 points on very efficient shooting  as well as dominated the boards with 8 and 7 rebounds repetitively  Alex Len also grabbed 7 rebounds  however  only finished with 4 points   Eric Bledsoe scored 17 points but dished out 10 assists and grabbed 7 rebounds as well  This was the second game in a row that Bledsoe recorded a minimum of 10 assists  following the 13 assists he dished out against the Lakers in the final game prior to the All Star Break  The feat marked the first time in his career that he recorded back to back games with at least 10 assists  It also marked the 20th time in his career that he has reached 10  assists in a game   For the Bulls  Dwayne Wade led the way with 23 points and 3 assists  Jimmy Butler scored 22 points  dished out 9 assists  and recorded 4 steals  Rajon Rondo also had 9 dimes  Nikola Mirtic scored 20 points and grabbed 8 redounds  leading Chicago ", 
        "body0": "GOLD Coast made hard work of it  but snuck past Essendon by three points in Mackay on Sunday  with draftees Ben Ainsworth and Will Brodie having major impacts   Ainsworth is almost a lock for round one and showed why he was taken with the fourth pick in last year's draft  kicking two goals and giving off another   Full match coverage and stats  Brodie  the No 9 pick  also kicked two goals to go with his 18 disposals   The Suns trailed by seven points midway through the final term  but kicked three straight goals to hit the lead before hanging on 12 7  79  to 12 4  76  at Harrup Park    The result is not the be all and end all  but where we're coming from  it was pleasing to win in the end   Gold Coast coach Rodney Eade said    I think it was a step up from our last game as far as our improvement    There were still some areas to work on  I thought our efficiency going inside 50 was average     shots at goal  we probably kicked four out on the full and missed some we should have kicked  so there's certainly some things to work on    While the Bombers lost their second straight JLT Community Series contest  there was plenty to be excited about  with first gamer Josh Begley kicking four goals   The No 31 pick was outstanding  kicking two goals in the first quarter  one in the second and one in the third in a performance that will surely push his name forward for an opening round selection   He was just as comfortable with the ball on the ground as he was with it in the air and added real spark to the Bombers' forward line    His first game out there today was impressive   coach John Worsfold said   He looked really dangerous    Jobe Watson continued to dust off the rust of 12 months out of the game  finishing with 24 disposals  while youngster Jayden Laverde was also a standout with three goals   Worsfold said after being thumped around the contest in the first quarter  Gold Coast led the clearances 16 2   his team fought back well    It was a real mixed performance   he said    Our ability to defend under real pressure was outstanding at times  and some of our rebound from the back half  we were really pleased with the ball movement    The reason those things had to be good was because we were giving Gold Coast first use of the ball and field position and we had to do our work from there    The way the boys adjusted after half time and stepped up to the challenge in addressing that was a real positive as well    The Suns deserved their win after conceding the game's first four goals   They led the disposals 407 350  clearances 36 26 and most tellingly the inside 50s by 59 40   Michael Barlow  31 disposals  13 contested  was prolific  while Alex Sexton  25 and two goals  was terrific in his first game of the season for the victors   WHAT WE LEARNED  Gold Coast  He might not be a household name  but Alex Sexton again proved he's one of the Suns' most important players  The 23 year old was arguably best afield in his first game for the season  finishing with 25 disposals  at 84 per cent efficiency   five clearances and two goals  Sexton is a recognised winger and loves to take the game on  He keeps his width and offers a great outlet for either defenders or midfielders  and as his 50m goal in the second quarter showed  has a thumping right foot that is always improving   Essendon  The Bombers want to move the ball quickly  When they got it in the back half  the likes of Hurley  Gleeson and Hartley couldn't wait to move it on  Sometimes it came unstuck  but when the midfielders linked up it was both exciting to watch and highly effective in giving the forwards time and space against their opponents  Joe Daniher had a tough first game for the season  but the quick movement gave a chance for Begley and Laverde to flourish   AN ABSOLUTE MIRACLE  How James Stewart managed to get that through is beyond belief   JLTSeries pic twitter com gOjykH8NGi   AFL   AFL  February 26  2017  NEW FACES  Gold Coast  Ben Ainsworth continued to show why he was so highly regarded at draft time  Aside from his two goals  perhaps the most impressive piece of play from the youngster was when he spotted Brandon Matera with a short chip pass when he could have easily blazed away at goal  Will Brodie got a little tired as the match wore on  but his inside grunt work was again on show  while his two first quarter goals helped steady the ship for the Suns  Mature recruits Michael Barlow  31 disposals  and Pearce Hanley  23  again impressed   Quick hands find Ben Ainsworth who delivers with his second   JLTSeries pic twitter com AJtOicngjU   AFL   AFL  February 26  2017  Essendon  Draftee Josh Begley made quite the impression in his first hit out  kicking three first half goals and finishing with four for the match  His first came following a brilliant pick up off his bootlaces and right foot snap  while two others came by finding space on the lead  No 1 draft pick Andrew McGrath looked more at home than his debut against Collingwood with his 16 disposals  His handballing in congestion was particularly impressive  Jordan Ridley  No 22 pick  had a sound game in defence  with one brilliant goal saving tackle on Ainsworth a highlight  while Dylan Clarke  No 63  had some nice touches in his 11 disposals  Recruits Josh Green and James Stewart kicked a goal each and looked dangerous from limited chances in the forward line   NEXT UP  After winning its first two games of the JLT Community Series  Gold Coast gets a break now before hosting the Western Bulldogs at Metricon
