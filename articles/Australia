Ooredoo plans to acquire new spectrum and incorporate additional carrier aggregation to enable Gigabit data speeds for customers using devices that will be made available later this year. Ooredoo has continued to upgrade its nationwide Ooredoo Supernet in recent months, boosting speeds, improving latency and enhancing the customer experience.\n\nIn a demonstration of 4.9G technology at Mobile World Congress 2017, Nokia showed Ooredoo how data speeds could be increased to 3Gbps in the future. Nokia 4.9G technology will be commercially available toward the end of 2017 and will allow leading operators like Ooredoo Qatar to evolve their networks on the path to 5G, meeting demands in the most densely populated megacities.\n\nWaleed Al-Sayed, Chief Executive Officer of Ooredoo Qatar, said: \"We are committed to providing our customers with the best possible data experience by deploying the latest and best technology on the Ooredoo Supernet. Data traffic continues to grow across our network and working with Nokia we can leverage the higher speeds enabled by 4.5G Pro now - and further boost speeds in the future with 4.9G when it becomes commercially available - to satisfy these demands.\"\n\nBernard Najm, head of the Middle East Market Unit at Nokia, said: \"We are delighted to continue our long history of collaborating with Ooredoo on this deployment.

We've changed Catalyst to be a one-hour documentary program over 17 hours. That's an example of the way we should be looking at ways of delivering.\n\n\"I think we should be looking at all our programs and looking at the impact they're having on audiences, and looking at new ways of telling those stories. I do feel that people are not turning to the 7pm news to find out what happens that day, so what does that mean?\"\n\nJob cuts to be felt in Sydney\n\nMs Guthrie confirmed the 150 to 200 job cuts announced on Tuesday would only affect management and support services, rather than content makers.\n\n\"The work to be done in the content areas is not about reducing employee numbers, it's actually about making further investments, because we don't have enough Australian content on television, we haven't made enough investments in regional areas,\" she said.\n\nMs Guthrie pointed to the 80 new roles to be created outside capital cities within 18 months as evidence of the corporation's commitment to regional Australia. The roles are being funded through a new content fund, which will be $20 million in the first year and eventually grow to $50 million.\n\nThe majority of job losses will be in Sydney, she said.\n\n\"If you look at where the majority of where the support and management roles are, they are in Sydney, so it will necessarily follow that the majority of those management and support roles will be removed from Sydney.\"\n\nDespite union criticism of the layoffs, Ms Guthrie said there would be no voluntary redundancies.\n\n\"Voluntary redundancies actually aren't the right way to look at our resources, because we have to be very targeted about the roles that we can do more efficiently or more effectively in a different way.\"\n\nABC not becoming more pro-business\n\nMs Guthrie also hit back at critics who say she is a \"Murdoch stooge\".\n\n\"I left News Corporation in 2007, so if I was a Murdoch stooge then I'm far removed from that. I left the organisation a long time ago,\" she said.\n\n\"The important thing in terms of my role at the ABC is to really try to take all of my experience from the past, whether it's from Google or my TV and pay TV experience from across the world, and figure out ways in which we can be more adaptable and deliver for audiences as their behaviour changes very substantially.\"\n\nShe also declined to criticise the Government's appointment of Western Australian mining lobbyist Vanessa Guthrie \u2014 no relation to the managing director \u2014 to the ABC board, overruling the advice of an independent selection panel.\n\nBut she rejected the suggestion that the ABC is becoming more pro-business.\n\n\"I don't think that's true at all,\" she said. \"It's important that we have a diverse board.\n\n\"It's important to have diversity in terms of gender, I think it's important in terms of geography, but I also think it's important in terms of life experience as well.\"\n\nBeing an advocate for funding\n\nAfter her Senate Estimates appearance last month, Ms Guthrie's statement that she would \"operate within\" the ABC's three-year funding envelope was taken to mean she did not see her role as an advocate for additional ABC funding.\n\nHowever, she told RN Drive she would advocate for more money \"at the appropriate time\".\n\n\"What I did say in my first week on the job is that we secured our triennial funding and my view is that we operate within that funding envelope,\" she said.\n\n\"As we going into further funding cycles we will be advocating very strongly for further investment, whether that's further investment around Australian drama or children's programming or, frankly, for further international services.\n\n\"But it seems to me that the important thing is the allocation of budget that we currently have, making sure that we spend as much of that on content creation as possible.\"\n\nTopics: broadcasting, abc, media, rural-media, information-and-communication, melbourne-3000\n\nFirst posted",

We are operating within the government\u2019s funding envelope and making decisions on audience behaviour and technological advancement.\u201d\n\nShe also refused to concede that anyone other than the 15 people who called the ABC to complain, or the 51 who gave submissions to a Senate committee, had been affected by the decision to scrap the shortwave radio service.\n\n\n\nShe appeared before a Senate estimates committee on Tuesday, answering questions about the decision to end the broadcasting of local radio through shortwave channels in the Northern Territory and Pacific region. The decision was been widely criticised, including by all major parties.\n\nGuthrie was unable to provide evidence of prior consultation on the decision and claimed the ABC was not the official emergency broadcaster.\n\nAsked by Greens senator Scott Ludlam about the \u201cextraordinary cuts\u201d to Radio National features, religion and music, Guthrie dismissed his premise, saying: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t characterise taking three music programs away from RN as an extraordinary decision.\u201d\n\nThe vote of no confidence in RN management was \u201cnot something we would desire but did not represent all the views of the staff at Radio National\u201d, Guthrie told Ludlam.\n\nCoalition handpicks mining lobbyist for ABC board position Read more\n\n\n\n\n\nGuthrie defended the hiring of former Rupert Murdoch TV executive Jim Rudder and \u201cbusiness transformation expert\u201d Deb Frances to help restructure the ABC.\n\n\u201cI am confident that our executive management have the skills and experience required to navigate the ABC through the challenges ahead but I am also aware that it is sensible to consult with people outside the organisation that have relevant experience,\u201d she said.\n\nShe confirmed that a restructure would be announced in the next week or so and that she had the support of the board.\n\n\u201cThe board is very supportive of the changes that need to be made as we experience audience shifts and digital disruption,\u201d she said. She declined to confirm there would be cuts to staff.\n\nGuthrie took many questions on notice and referred to her notes to answer the details of many of the questions, at one point saying she had only been in the job for 10 months.\n\nShe said the ABC had been contacted by fewer than 15 people, including just six from the Northern Territory, over the cuts to shortwave radio.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t in our interest at all to cut off any person from our services,\u201d she said. \u201cBut frankly the low number of complaints from listeners highlights previous research which shows that shortwave is used by very few people as their primary means for listening to radio.\u201d\n\nGuthrie returned to the 15 official complaints repeatedly during the estimates hearing.\n\nNationals senator Bridget McKenzie and Labor senator Malarndirri McCarthy pointed to criticism by a number of stakeholder groups, including the NT Cattlemen\u2019s Association, fishing associations, remote Indigenous organisations and the NT government.\n\nGuthrie said she had not received a letter from the Cattlemen\u2019s Association. McCarthy questioned why Guthrie was discounting a letter from herself and fellow parliamentarian Warren Snowdon, which outlined the peak body\u2019s concerns.\n\nGuthrie was also asked to provide the research which led to the board\u2019s decision, and evidence of prior consultation. She said the ABC hadn\u2019t consulted with the community until after the announcement, but had spoken to stakeholders before it. She was unable to name any of the stakeholders, and took all requests for research or evidence on notice.\n\nThe committee chair, senator Linda Reynolds, revealed a committee inquiry set up to examine the decision had received 52 submissions about the shortwave cut, and only one \u2013 the ABC\u2019s \u2013 was in support.\n\nAt the end of an hour of questioning Reynolds said she hoped the ABC would take the issue more seriously and was disappointed in the lack of answers from Guthrie. Guthrie said the ABC did take it seriously.\n\n\u201cI agree that it\u2019s terrible when 15 people are affected, or 52 people are affected, but I will say that we\u2019d love to hear from them directly and find ways in which we can work with them to actually transition those services,\u201d she said.\n\nReynolds responded: \u201cIf that\u2019s what you have taken out of what the senators and submissions have said to you \u2013 that it\u2019s only 15 people or 52 submitters which is the extent of people affected by that \u2013 I think we are going to have some very interesting discussions in the next hearing.\u201d\n\nIn response to concerns raised that people without shortwave would lose the emergency broadcasts during floods, fires, and cyclones, Guthrie said the ABC was not the emergency broadcaster in the NT.\n\n\n\nA spokesman for the ABC later clarified Guthrie was referring specifically to ABC shortwave as an emergency service provider.\n\nGuthrie said the ABC\u2019s priority \u201chas to be the efficient management of our total ABC budget\u201d and it was clear the continued provision of shortwave was \u201cnot in the best interest of the efficient operation of the ABC budget\u201d.\n\n\n\nAsked directly if she would reverse the decision, Guthrie said no.",

GO DADDY GO (N/R) is another Uncle Mo from the Anthony Cummings stable \u2014 he might have them all! Good trial behind Sanctioned into this.\n\nRACE 3\n\nIF the trials are anything to go by, it seems that 1. SWEET SERENDIPITY (73) is back in the kind of shape that he was when he was flying. Remember this horse? He won the Inglis 2YO Challenge on debut. The son of Excites is very fast and has a preset racing pattern of leading and going pretty quick wire to wire. This is 1000m at home and we know that most times when it\u2019s very wet at the Farm that it\u2019s best to be closer to first than last. Drawn 1 which means we know he\u2019ll lead if he wants. 5. ALPEN ROSE (68) has the race fitness edge on the toppie and could end up right alongside him, or just behind, if ridden like she has been at her last two. The daughter of Swiss Ace is an absolute muddie with 4s 3w on heavy and placed 5 from 9 on slow. Hard to ignore 2. FIFTEEN SUNFLOWERS (72). She won at Wyong first-up with a big weight and late surge then came to HQ and swept aside Realise Potential and Glenall. She\u2019s 5s 4w at 1000m and seems effective enough on wet.\n\nRACE 4\n\n11. TAMARACK (64) is a promising horse. He was $7 into $5.50 on debut at Wyong on Feb. 1 when 3.5-lens 2nd and basically ran out of ground. I mean, he was never ever going to pass Peaceful Sea (the winner) with the run she had. Tamarack went to Beaumont next time (raced handier) and thrashed two midweek city class horses in Think Like A Bird and Midnight Delight. That\u2019s 1200m to 1350m and now a mile at home. The Gun on tomorrow again. Both wins on good but he\u2019s got a wet trackers pedigree. 6. POTENT FORCE (66) was a shade disappointing first-up at Rosehill in that midweeker on Feb. 22. That said, he wasn\u2019t humiliated by any means and you knew as they crossed the line that he was looking for the mile. Quite a few other chances here chief among them is 4. KARAVALI (70) whose only run on heavy was back home in NZ when she ran 4th in the G1 Sire\u2019s Produce beaten 0.9-lens. Third-up here off two 2nds for new trainer Kris Lees. 9. EARTH (64) \u2014 big improver!\n\nRACE 5\n\nI REMEMBER thinking and writing how 10. OCTAVIAN AUGUSTUS (62) was going to win the Carbine Club. He didn\u2019t, his stablemate Comin\u2019 Through did but I still retain a soft spot for this fellow. He had two nice trials leading into the return at Rosehill (midweeker Feb. 22) which accounts for the $6 into $4.20 on the day. The horse ran 8th of 10 but he was only beaten 2-lens and while he didn\u2019t necessarily make much ground, he didn\u2019t lose any either. His second-up form is not flash and he\u2019s a bit unknown on heavy but he handles slow. There are a good half dozen chances in this race not least 7. DRACHENFELS (65) who is lightly raced and rather talented. He beat 6. DORTMUND (66) second-up at Beaumont and we know the form was solid given that Dortmund himself has won since \u2014 well, he actually bolted in by 4.3-lens. Nods to 3. AJANI (68) and the always honest 4. STAR SHAFT (67).\n\nRACE 6\n\n1. JEMADAR (72) is a Godolphin bred Sepoy gelding that is also first-up. He is 4s 2-2-0 and 1 from 1 fresh. Loved his two trials \u2014 don\u2019t worry about the 6th of 8 and 8th of 9 finishing positions, he was super both times. He has been placed 2nd from his only run on slow, this might be heavy and while Sepoy\u2019s would be a risk on the slop as a general rule, every horse is different and he seemed to be sweet in that last trial on the heavy 8 at Rosehill. 4. BE LIKE DAD (67) is another of the first-upers here. He is 4s 0-2-0 fresh and what I like best about him is that his 4s 0-1-2 on heavy. One just cannot knock the Chris Waller trained 5. NOTHING BOX (67) on that big first-up win at Rosehill. Drawn 1 which will make it easy to lead or be in the top 3 if that is the plan which I suspect it is.\n\nRACE 7\n\nTRIAL horse again here folks \u2014 9. FANTASIZE (67) from the Snowden camp. The daughter of Authorized was a super 2nd in her Randwick heat on Feb. 16 and we know she backs it up on race day given she is 3s 1-1-0 fresh and 7s 2-2-0 overall. Re the wet she is more than adept on slow and I\u2019d have no worry about an Authorized on wet. 3. DIAMOND MADE (71) didn\u2019t come up to any degree in the spring but we start again in the autumn now and cross fingers. It\u2019s a very big risk to just assume she\u2019s going to suddenly bounce back to form after a lot of \u2018outs\u2019 but she\u2019s with a good trainer, she is at home, she likes the wet. Want big odds though. 2. COTTAGE (74) is 1 for 1 at the track and 2 for 2 at the trip. Two important stats on top of those are that she is 2s 1-1-0 and, or should that be BUT, she is 1s 0-0-0 on soft and no runs on heavy.\n\nRACE 8\n\n2. NEW UNIVERSE (67) is just about the most interesting runner all day. He is a Waller recruit who is 3s 2w and a 5th in NZ. Last run was the 5th at Ellerslie on Boxing Day so it\u2019s not like he is first-up for months. The trial was really good, very Waller-esque \u2014 hit the line with a full tank! By Darci Brahma who is adored in NZ and the female line is huge 3rd Dam is Eau D\u2019Etoile. It\u2019s a fabulous race actually, six of the 15 are last start winners including 4. BRAVISSIMO (66) and 5. I THOUGHT SO (66). We know Bravissimo handles the slop, he won his maiden here on the heavy 10 On Feb. 8 beating two handy fillies in Red Hearts and Smart Amelia. As for I Thought So, well \u2018I knew so\u2019 that he would win at Randwick first-up; you don\u2019t trial like it did and come out and lose. It was a good fighting win from a very gutsy and super handsome colt. Racing at home tomorrow. I am going to watch the flucs like a hawk and decide what to do after we see what the markets do with New Universe \u2014 surely they back him!\n\nRACE 9\n\nANOTHER tough race, it sure is a competitive day tomorrow, let\u2019s hope the sun comes out and we get a fair surface. Any one of a these horses could win this race, any one at all, seriously. I\u2019m with 7. STEEL FROST (70) mainly because I was watching him coming up through the grades very quickly last prep. He has two big changes tomorrow in terms of gear; blinkers on, winkers off \u2014 first time both. The only time he raced on a rain affected track was a slow 6 at Canberra and he won by 5-lens. 11. OUR VENTURA (67) is a genuine muddie being 4s 1-2-0 on heavy tracks. She\u2019s back from the paddock here with the aid of two trials. She is a big, big player with no weight at all. Sometimes the numbers say it better than words even can and that\u2019s the story with 3. MONOGRAM (77) who is 4s 2-0-1 fresh and 1 for 1 on the heavy. She hasn\u2019t raced in a far while (Jul. 2016) but trialled twice and without wishing to sound patronising, the stable know what they are doing.\n\nRACE 10\n\nA TRUE Get Out Stakes here, anything goes, value is the order of the day. Not many of us can afford to bet on three horses in the one race but I am so torn between my trio that it might be on the only way? That said, I am happy to have the Mark Newnham trained 10. RIGHTEOUS MATE (68) on top here. The 3YO is 4s 1-1-1 and you may remember that he won a Gosford maiden on Oct. 13 then on Nov. 3 he came from last to run 1-lens 2nd in a Listed 1800m race at Flemington at the carnival. Not flash in the ring Stakes first-up I concede, but went back to the drawing board and trialled enormous! I have a massive watch on 12. LEAD CHOREOGRAPHER (65) from the Waller camp. He was $21 first run for Waller in Oz and I could not fault it \u2014 he was 6th of 10 beaten 5.5-lens but he never yielded any ground in the straight, He just wants the mile now. 9. CANNON RUN (67) has a lot going for him. He has been racing in great form and is obviously a very fit horse.",

Photo: Pat Scala\n\nBut one thing that's never been updated is the ball.\n\nThat could all be about to change.\n\nFor the first time in 137 years, Sherrin has deviated from its original design in order to build a skill-based ball, to help all ages and abilities fine-tune their kicking.\n\nIt's called the Sherrin Precision and if Mark \"Choco'' Williams has his way it could eventually replace the current game ball.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"I'm not sure as time goes on why this can't be the normal football,\" Williams explained to Fairfax Media, as he kicked one of his new Sherrins to Richmond star, close friend and protege Dustin Martin.\n\n\"We replaced small-headed racquets [in tennis], they're all gone. [Thinner] cricket bats and golf clubs, no one uses them any more. But at the time everyone thought they were crazy.\"\n\nWilliams is a visionary.\n\nHe etched himself into AFL history when he led Port Adelaide to their first premiership in 2004.\n\nHe may just have changed the game again.\n\nBuilt with large points on either end of the ball, the design increases the size of the impact zone for the kicker's boot, while the painted yellow line provides guidance for the correct spin a drop punt should have.\n\n\"It's more forgiving, that's the idea of it,\" Williams said.\n\n\"You get more success, so you'll kick more and you'll think; 'yeah, I can do this!'\n\n\"Golf clubs, went from little to big, cricket bats \u2026 same thing.\"\n\n\"Everyone laughed at those sports when they started \u2013 and I'm saying this is not just for little kids.\n\n\"This is for adults, elite players. This is for goal-kickers, for people who miss passes.\"\n\nThe ball is likely to be introduced into the Auskick program soon and will be made available to all senior football leagues, including the AFL.\n\n\"People like Levi Casboult and set shots for goal \u2013 this would be fantastic for him.\"\n\nThe Precision has been a concept Williams started working on with his son Isaac as part of a school project, more than eight years ago.\n\n\"I originally wanted to call it the 'i-ball,\" he chuckled.\n\nSince then, it's gone through a plethora of testing with a range of different footballers, including one of the game's best in Martin.\n\n\"Choc brought it in last year for a bit of a trial and there was a group of us who got out on the oval and had a bit of a kick with it and a play around,\" Martin said.\n\n\"He does have a few crazy ideas,\" Martin said as he smiled at Williams.\n\n\"But I certainly think this one is going to be very good for people wanting to improve their kicking.\"\n\nLike Williams, Martin is pushing for the new ball to eventually replace the current design, such is his delight with the fresh concept.\n\n\"Hopefully, yeah. It's great. It's good to improve the kicking.\"\n\nIt's no secret that Williams and Martin have shared a close bond since their time together at Punt Road.\n\nWhile Martin refused to talk about his playing future at the Tigers, he was willing to open up on his relationship with his mentor.\n\n\"Choc came to the club probably three or four years ago, we just had a close relationship and we still do.\n\n\"I still see his family probably most weeks for dinner or just to catch up, I'm sure he'll put on something nice for me tonight after this.\"\n\nAlthough Williams has left Richmond in an official capacity, he still plays a significant role in Martin's life.\n\nThey see each other each week after Tigers games, where they sit and analyse Martin's games while watching replays.\n\n\"Coming third in the Brownlow and making the All-Australian team and winning the best and fairest \u2026 I couldn't be more proud of Dustin,\" Williams said.\n\nOn top of the Precision, Sherrin will on Wednesday launch a second football; the Griptech.\n\nBuilt with the help of Professor Kevin Ball, the Griptech is specifically designed for boys and girls who will transition through different skill sets.\n\nThe three stages start with the easiest material to grip and end with what's known as the \"transition grip\", which is likened to a basketball and helps children move from synthetic into leather footballs at a more senior level.",

Photo: Fox Sports\n\nHis only public tactic - avoidance - was laid bare in embarrassing circumstances again on Wednesday at the MCG when he failed to rationally handle some reasonable questions about his contract status. Journalists are not fools and they attended the Williams promotion to gain some insight into Martin, not to talk at length about a new shape of a Sherrin.\n\nWilliams must have know that. Certainly the Tigers did once they learned after the fact about Martin's involvement in their former coach's venture. If they worked to advise their reigning club champion about what to expect and how best to handle contract questions then the message was lost in translation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat eventuated was a little mortifying to witness and as Martin walked away the expression on the face of Richmond's media manager Jaimee Damon said it all. Martin, who has now twice struggled with questions about his future at two promotional appearances, abandoned the press conference leaving Williams to pick up the pieces.\n\nRichmond claim they are confident they will come to terms with Martin although his contract negotiations have a history of turning messy. His manager Ralph Carr botched matters last time around and has been inconsistent in his version of affairs this time.\n\nSHARE\n\nShare on Facebook\n\nShare on Twitter\n\nLink In the thick of it: Dustin Martin looks to handball. Photo: Getty Images\n\nReportedly the offer from Richmond is close to acceptable so maybe Martin is hedging his bets on the basis of an insecure coach and a desire to play for a successful club. Hopefully there is a good reason behind the delay otherwise Carr is doing his fragile client a bigger disservice than Williams.\n\nIn an era that football clubs obsess about messaging it was another negative message from Richmond at a time when hope remains their No.1 selling point. On Sunday, after a solid pre-season performance against Port Adelaide, Hardwick struggled again publicly when he scoffed at having to deal with a six-day break. In March. At a time when clubs can be more than flexible with their line-ups.\n\nSeveral clubs have taken issue with the league's JLT fixture and some have had a point - notably West Coast which was sent to Narrandera in the middle of New South Wales last month. But Hardwick's comments came across as whingeing and hinted at fragility. To Brendon Bolton's credit, after his side was thrashed by the Saints before facing the double-whammy of a six-day break and a trip to Perth, he made no mention of those peripheral issues.\n\nThe Tigers face at least five six-day breaks this season and successive ones from rounds five to seven. Surely Hardwick would be embracing the practice.\n\nBut back to Hardwick's former coaching ally. Mark Williams is rightly proud of the manner in which he has guided and supported Martin who remains a high maintenance prospect for the Tigers. And Martin, in return, has remained loyal to his mentor.\n\nBut Williams is the experienced one. Streetwise and well-versed in these matters he should have known better than to thrust Martin into the public eye.",

To say that Jack should just play deep ... he'd be on his own a fair bit I reckon,\" he said.\n\n\"It's very much a two-way game now but if we can get the ball to Jack as a forward then the more goals he kicks and the better off we'll be.\"\n\nThe Tigers will be desperate for a good start after they were slow out of the blocks in each of the past three seasons.\n\nWith Steve Morris the only long-term injury concern, Hardwick will at least have plenty of selection options as he enters a pivotal campaign.",

Under the real estate section of his register he lists only a residential property in Canberra.\n\nWhat you will find elsewhere on his register is a shareholding in a company called Twenty-Eight KW. Bernardi set up this company in 2015 and then used it to buy the Kent Town building soon after.\n\nBernardi believes he has fully complied with the parliamentary disclosure rules.\n\n\"The building is owned by a company. I have declared shares in the company. It's not rocket science,\" Bernardi said.\n\nUnder the rules, MPs are required to declare shareholdings in public and private companies and real estate assets, including the location of the property and the purpose for which it is being used.

But he's got wriggle-room here because the rules stipulate you only have to declare everything of which you are \"aware\". At the time he was reportedly living in a house owned by his wife, which he had not declared.\n\nKatter is thumbing his nose at the rules because as every politician in Canberra knows, the rules are a toothless joke.\n\nHe's not the only MP to take this cavalier approach to a spouse's interests. New Liberal MP Jason Falinski, in just about every field on his register, says he hasn't asked his solicitor wife Nichola Constant about her holdings.\n\nAcross the board, spousal incomes are rarely declared. Everyone takes a different approach to mortgages and liabilities. Some list credit cards, most don't. Very few list cars, even though the rules require all assets valued at more than $7500 to be listed. Many regularly update their register to declare gifts, like free tickets to the footy or the opera - but others seldom make changes after their initial declaration.\n\nAcross the board, there are glaring gaps and inconsistencies, and a startling lack of detail. Some disclosures are typed, others scrawled in illegible handwriting. Buried on the Parliament House website, the documents are not searchable by keyword. And when updates do occur, reporters typically only learn about it from a Twitter-bot set up by Guardian journalist Nick Evershed. Without that, most would go through to the keeper.\n\nAnd what happens when a journalist - or a political enemy - catches someone breaking the rules? Some embarrassing news coverage, maybe a slap on the wrist, and that's about it. No one is ever actually held to account.\n\nFor most MPs, like Cash, there's no suggestion they've tried to do anything dodgy - they've just been careless. But taxpayers deserve the highest of disclosure standards so we can make up our own minds.\n\nThe Turnbull government is finally moving to clean up MP's entitlements.

In the 1980s, then-premier Brian Peckford committed to develop a pay equity plan to compensate underpaid female workers in public-sector jobs.\n\nHappy IWD to all women.

The boys then read out some of the quotes - such as the one above - to camera with responses varying from confronting stories about women being told that they were too flat chested, that they're not smart enough to be an economist, to their experiences of being sexually violated and galvanising quotes about wanting equal opportunity to pursue their dreams.\n\nSHARE\n\nShare on Facebook SHARE\n\nShare on Twitter TWEET\n\nLink A screengrab from the Sydney Boys High video.\n\nOther quotes included one from a girl who was told by her father that \"I should be ashamed of my body and I had thunder thighs,\" and another from someone who said at work she was called a \"b--ch rather than a leader.\"\n\nSchool captain Hugh Bartley, who was involved in the video, says it is part of a week-long campaign at the school to examine gender equality and how feminism affects both men and women.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"The video is actually part of a wider campaign running at school ... to promote gender equal values within the school to get boys thinking about feminism and the role of men and women in society and what they can do to influence that in a positive way,\" he says.\n\nBartley says \"while not a perfect video\" the response has been \"unbelievable\" and wildly beyond what they had imagined. He says the positive reactions have vastly outnumbered any negative reactions. Pushback has included comments that the boys shouldn't be speaking on behalf of women's experiences and that they didn't acknowledge that men are also impacted by the patriarchy.\n\nIt's a point that Bartley acknowledges, saying that one of the reasons the video has made an impact is the \"incongruity\" of the boy's speaking about very female lived experiences. It has, he says, a shock value that would hopefully get people talking. Bartley also acknowledges that, sadly, when men speak, people tend to listen.\n\n\"As young men [we are] using our privilege and platform to express desires for gender equality, and men to be more considerate of women in everyday lives,\" he says.\n\nThe week has also included workshops for the junior boys at the school on how gender stereotypes impact boys and girls including ideas around \"toxic masculinity\" and where feminism fits in with dismantling those ideas.\n\nSydney Boys High principal Dr. Kim Jaggar said the drive for the video came from the school leadership group and is part of a push for discussing gender equality.\n\n\"Their video was a demonstration to our students that women's equality is a men's issue. They have a project to raise awareness about inequality in school life and in the wider community. An Equality Committee, made up of representatives from all years, was introduced at the assembly on Monday where the video was also shown to the boys. It was well received and has since attracted a substantial online viewing audience,\" he says.\n\nBartley says that he hopes gender equality is something that is discussed \"not just on International Women's Day but 365 days a year.\"\n\nMaking the video, he says, was a reminder to keep up the efforts and to keep taking steps to reach gender parity, \"something that all young men of future generations need to talk about.\"",
