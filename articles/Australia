Presenters Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway had just awarded the Oscar for Best Picture to \u201cLa La Land.\u201d The only problem was they were supposed to give \u201cMoonlight\u201d that honor, and there had been a terrible mix-up behind the scenes.

After stuffing the envelopes and locking them in a briefcase, they memorize the list of winners. Just last week, the duo blogged on The Huffington Post about the process, and described a meticulous system for ensuring there were no mistakes: \u201cWe hand each envelope directly to the presenter in each category.

He refused to let them go.\n\nTara Brown was young, beautiful, popular and a devoted mother.\n\nLionel Patea was her partner of four years, the father of the three-year-old daughter she doted on.\n\nHe was also an ex-Bandido, a one-time sergeant-at-arms with a violent criminal past.\n\nIt was a propensity for violence that would claim his estranged girlfriend\u2019s life in the most horrific of ways.\n\nOn Monday, in the Brisbane Supreme Court, the 25-year-old New Zealander was sentenced to life in jail after pleading guilty to her murder.\n\nPatea penned a handwritten letter to the court expressing his remorse.\n\nThe letter was written specifically for yesterday\u2019s court hearing, the New Zealand Herald reported.\n\nBrown\u2019s mother Natalie Hinton told the court she had not read Patea\u2019s three-page letter, nor did she want to.\n\nJustice Debra Mullins released it to the media after Patea\u2019s life sentence was handed down.\n\nThe letter reads:\n\nThere are no words that can possibly describe how remorseful I am for the events leading up to and on September the 8th of 2015.\n\nNothing I can say can bring Tara back.\n\nNothing I can do can get her returning home to us.\n\nIf there was I would do it in a heart beat.\n\nI would like to apologise from the bottom of my heart to both sides of our family - especially to her later father Patrick.\n\nPat, I really let you down.\n\nI would like to apologise to my daughter.\n\nThese events and outcomes are simply unspeakable and I only have myself to blame.\n\nSo many people have been affected by this.\n\nThe question that haunts us all - how such a tragedy like this could ever have even happened?\n\nUnfortunately I don\u2019t have the answers and can\u2019t clarify it for myself either.\n\nI hoped today in court gives everyone personally involved some sort of closure.\n\nTara was everything to me.\n\nThose of you that were close to her, those of you that were close to us all know how my sun rose and set for her.\n\nShe was my everything - still is.\n\nTara was a dream catch, that one-in-a-million girl.\n\nBeautiful, gentle, warm, kind hearted and loving.\n\nMy own angel on earth - that is how she will always be remembered by me.\n\nThat is how I want her to always be remembered by everybody else too.\n\n(My daughter) has lost a mum and dad. Both families lose.\n\nA mother, daughter, father, sister and son.\n\nThere is no winning here, it\u2019s a loss for everybody involved.\n\nMy actions were unforgivable and I do not expect forgiveness.\n\nI am not expecting any leniency from the Crown here today either.\n\nLife is jail is only part one of my sentence.\n\nLiving out our days without Tara is part two.\n\nThe hardest sentence of all? One day I am going to have to explain to my daughter what happened to mummy.\n\nAs (she) grows old I expect her features and her demeanour will be constant reminders of how beautiful her mother was, the likeness in her being so familiar - like mother, like daughter.\n\nI will endeavour to rehabilitate whilst in custody.\n\nMaybe one day I can help prevent another occurrence like this from every happen ding again.\n\nI pray that Tara\u2019s legacy thrives and lives on in (my daughter).\n\nLionel John Patea, 27/02/2017\n\nLAST TIME TARA BROWN KISSED HER DAUGHTER GOODBYE\n\nOn an otherwise unremarkable sunny Gold Coast Tuesday morning in September 2014, Tara Brown dropped the couple\u2019s daughter, Aria, at a daycare centre.\n\nIt was the last time the smiling little girl she described as \u201cmy world\u201d would kiss her mum goodbye.\n\nUnbeknown to the 24-year-old, Patea was there waiting for her that morning.\n\nHe had called the childcare centre an hour earlier to make sure Aria was booked in that day.\n\nTara had tried to leave him before but he had not allowed it.\n\nHe emptied her bank account, monitored her phone and prevented her leaving their house.\n\nThe young New Zealander\u2019s mother, Natalie Hinton, said her daughter was living in fear.\n\n\u201cThe monster controlled her,\u201d she told the Supreme Court on Monday, after Patea finally entered his guilty plea.\n\nIn her final days, however, Tara had succeeded in breaking free.\n\nShe had gone into hiding, helped by friends and domestic violence services, as she began to establish a new life for herself and Aria, a life in which she hoped to study law.\n\nThe day before the fatal confrontation, Patea\u2019s lawyers had been served with interim custody papers.\n\nPatea apparently had no intention of letting his daughter go, or, at least, planned to punish her mother for leaving.\n\nOn the morning of September 8, 2015, just before 9am, he confronted Tara in the car park of Aria\u2019s childcare centre.\n\nShe fled to the perceived safety of her black Mazda 2 but, ultimately, it was no match for Patea\u2019s Jeep four wheel drive.\n\nShe sped away, Patea in hot pursuit.\n\nThe estranged couple reached speeds of more than 100km/hr, as the young mother desperately tried to escape.\n\nAt a set of traffic lights on a busy road in Nerang, witnesses saw Patea using both fists to bash on the driver\u2019s side window of Tara\u2019s car.\n\nThe terrified young woman zoomed off and made a frantic emergency call while driving.\n\n\u201cHelp me, help me, help me,\u201d she screamed at the operator, only able to give Molendinar, a quiet inland Gold Coast suburb, as her location.\n\nThe helpless operator was soon to hear Tara die.\n\nIt was at a residential intersection where Patea finally ran her off the road.\n\nCCTV footage from a nearby home captured her small car careering at speed down an embankment and into a backyard, his Jeep then coming to a stop nearby.\n\nThe camera captured Patea as he got out of his car and ran towards the wreckage, where the mother of his child lay trapped in her overturned vehicle.\n\nBut he was not there to help her.\n\nPatea picked up a 7.8kg metal fire hydrant cover that he passed by.\n\n\u201cLionel, stop, please help me,\u201d the young mother screamed, before the emergency call captured the murderous horror that unfolded in the backyard of the Macquarie Avenue home.\n\nAs Tara lay, unable to escape, he inflicted 29 savage blows upon her head, the sickening thuds captured in the continuing emergency call she had made just moments before.\n\nNeighbours who heard the crash and came running to the scene.\n\nOne, mistakenly believing Patea was trying to help her, smashed the car window, which unwittingly aided the ex-bikie\u2019s frenzied attack.\n\nOthers tried to intervene but there was no stopping the rage-fuelled bashing.\n\nLisa Kennedy told the court in a victim impact statement on Monday she remained haunted by Tara\u2019s bashing, which she said, \u201chorrified me to my core\u201d.\n\n\u201cShe was screaming at me to help her from you,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cDid I do my best, did I try hard enough?\n\n\u201cI felt like I had failed Tara.\u201d\n\nThe tape recorded Tara as she kicked and screamed for help through blow after brutal blow.\n\nAfter the 27th thud she fell silent.\n\nPatea\u2019s murderous work was done. Tara Brown was brain dead.\n\nWith the fatal blow delivered, Patea fled the scene, stealing a Gold Coast City Council ute parked nearby to make his escape.\n\nAbout an hour later, he surrendered himself to Coomera Police Station with self-inflicted stab wounds.\n\nHe was taken to the Gold Coast University Hospital, where, in a nearby ward, Tara lay unconscious.\n\nPublicly, police said her condition was critical.\n\nPrivately, they knew she was already gone.\n\nHer head injuries and facial fractures were so severe, there was no possible way she could ever have survived them.\n\nThe doctors kept her on life support so her family could say their final goodbyes.\n\nTara\u2019s distraught family flew in from New Zealand.\n\nMs Hinton described her pain at seeing her daughter in her hospital bed, with multiple fractures disfiguring her beautiful face.\n\nShe was \u201cbroken\u201d, Ms Hinton said, \u201ca shadow of her beauty\u201d.\n\nOn Wednesday night, the family turned Tara\u2019s life support machine off and she slipped away.\n\nLionel Patea remained in a bed in the same hospital, under police guard, charged with attempted murder, along with domestic violence and driving offences.\n\nHe had admitted to hospital staff he, \u201cdid something bad to her\u201d.\n\nThe attempted murder charge was upgraded to murder at his first court appearance, in Southport Magistrates Court a week later.\n\nThen 24, Patea could only mournfully nod his head when the magistrate asked him if he understood the charge was now murder.\n\nHis markedly forlorn figure came in stark contrast to the frenzied, enraged man who neighbours were powerless to stop in the Molendinar backyard.\n\nPatea has remained in custody in the 18 months since, but it was not until Monday morning, just as his murder trial was about to begin, that he finally pleaded guilty to killing Tara.\n\nHe could not look at the young woman\u2019s mother as she read her victim impact statement and talked about how the now four-year-old Aria continued to ask about her mum.\n\nOutside court, Patea\u2019s lawyer, Campbell McCallum, read a statement on behalf of his client, in which he said he knew he would never be forgiven.\n\nHe acknowledged the \u201cenormous pain\u201d he had caused Tara\u2019s family and said his \u201cmain focus\u201d was his daughter Aria, the little girl whose mother he had so savagely murdered.\n\n\u201cI do not wish to cause Tara\u2019s family any further pain nor delay their need for justice, I accept without reservation the punishment imposed upon me by the justice system today,\u201d Patea\u2019s statement said.\n\n\u201cI know Tara will never be forgotten, nor will I ever be forgiven.\n\n\u201cI just hope that I can today stop any further potential pain or suffering for Tara\u2019s family and I\n\nI now live only for my daughter Aria.\u201d\n\nIn sentencing Patea to life in jail, with a non-parole period of 20 years on Monday, Justice Debra Mullins sought to remind him that it was Aria who would also continually serve as a reminder of what he had done.\n\n\u201cYou have to live every day of your life knowing that you deprived Ms Brown of her life and your daughter of her mother,\u201d she said.\n\nPatea will be eligible for parole at the age of 44, in 2035.\n\nAnyone in need of assistance is urged to contact the national domestic violence helpline on 1800 737 732 or 1800 RESPECT.

And to Mr. Trump\u2019s critics, Hollywood\u2019s flaws would pale in comparison to the president\u2019s moves against immigration, transgender rights and environmental protections, among other indignities.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Leonard\u2019s argument is that in Hollywood, the more diverse the executive ranks, the better the chance for diversity in storytelling. As The Atlantic reports in its latest issue, his list \u2014 which polls hundreds of film executives on the best overlooked scripts they\u2019ve read \u2014 has helped push into production great screenplays, including \u201cSlumdog Millionaire\u201d and \u201cSpotlight,\u201d both of which won best picture.\n\nThis year\u2019s more diverse Oscar slate centered on unexpected hits like \u201cMoonlight\u201d (about a black youth struggling with his sexual identity in abusive home and school environments); \u201cHidden Figures\u201d (about unheralded black, female mathematicians at NASA during the space race); and \u201cFences\u201d (based on the August Wilson play about the generational struggles of a working-class black family in Pittsburgh).\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSome of the nominees from those films \u2014 Octavia Spencer in \u201cHidden Figures,\u201d the supporting actress winner Viola Davis in \u201cFences\u201d and the supporting actor winner Mahershala Ali in \u201cMoonlight\u201d \u2014 \u201chave been in the industry forever,\u201d Mr. Leonard noted. \u201cBut the rise of a new generation of filmmakers and the slow realization that diversity can result in box office results has finally given many of these actors roles that are worthy of their talents.\u201d\n\nSlow, however, is the operative word.\n\nJanice Min, a part owner of The Hollywood Reporter, told me that Hollywood still runs \u201clike a series of private country clubs\u201d where who\u2019s in and who\u2019s out depends on membership committees largely controlled by Hollywood power brokers who are overwhelmingly white and male.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cAs any sociology major will tell you, people flock to people they know and people that are like them,\u201d Ms. Min said.\n\nPlease verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The ranking, she wrote, pitted women against each other when they needed to band together in the face of their many obstacles here.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe magazine\u2019s current list of Hollywood\u2019s most powerful \u2014 people \u201cwith the ability to say \u2018yes\u2019 and get a show made or a movie made,\u201d as the magazine\u2019s editorial director Matthew Belloni described it \u2014 has its share of women in the top 25, including the Universal Pictures chairwoman Donna Langley; the Fox Television Group chairwoman Dana Walden; and Oprah Winfrey.\n\nBut it was otherwise short on blacks, Hispanics and Asians. The studios I reached out to last week weren\u2019t eager to speak to me about the issue, perhaps because the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission is weighing whether to bring a lawsuit against the major studios over charges the American Civil Liberties Union brought that the studios discriminated against women in hiring decisions for directors.\n\nThe A.C.L.U. pointed to research by the University of Southern California\u2019s Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism showing that women had accounted for only 1.9 percent of the directors of the top 100 grossing films in 2013 and 2014.\n\nThe author of that research, Stacy L. Smith, said in an interview that part of the problem had to do with myths throughout the industry \u2014 that women don\u2019t want to direct big-budget blockbusters, for instance, or that certain movies won\u2019t make money.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMs. Smith said she saw the success of \u201cHidden Figures\u201d as pivotal because it would speak to Hollywood in its favorite language: cash. \u201cHere we have a film not only nominated for best picture but is financially lucrative,\u201d she said. It had generated nearly $170 million in worldwide receipts as of last week, Bloomberg reported.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nFor all of its strides toward diversity, the awards season had its wrinkles. As The Times reported in January, some saw race as a factor in the way Nate Parker\u2019s film, \u201cThe Birth of a Nation,\u201d lost its luster after the resurfacing of a case in which Mr. Parker was acquitted of charges that he raped a female student while at Penn State. However, Casey Affleck cruised to a best actor nomination for \u201cManchester by the Sea,\u201d and won, despite having settled sexual harassment allegations made against him in two civil suits (he denied the allegations).\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAlso, this year\u2019s awards saw a second chance for Mel Gibson, whose best director nomination for \u201cHacksaw Ridge\u201d came just over 10 years after he made anti-Semitic and misogynist remarks during a drunken-driving arrest.\n\nIt was around the same time that Mr. Trump was caught on tape by \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d bragging about grabbing women\u2019s genitals.\n\nMr. Gibson, of course, is an actor and director. Mr. Trump is now president and Los Angeles is such a bastion of opposition against him that it was only natural that he would inspire some political Oscar speeches this year.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut Hollywood\u2019s judgment would go a lot further if it directed some of that political energy back at itself.", 
        "body2": "It may not have been the biggest upset in Oscar history but it certainly was the biggest screw-up.\n\nAs the creators of La La Land, the movie much favoured to win best picture at Sunday\u2019s Academy Awards, began their acceptance speeches, a commotion erupted behind them. Then La La Land producer Jordan Horowitz stepped forward to tell the audience that Moonlight had actually won and to hand back his Oscar.\n\nOops! Watch 'Moonlight' win best picture after botched announcement (The Associated Press)\n\nIt was all a stupid mix-up: Somebody had given Warren Beatty the envelope for Emma Stone\u2019s best actress win in La La Land and he had showed it to co-presenter Faye Dunaway with some puzzlement before she simply read out that title.\n\nRelated: The highs and the lows (and one big blunder) at this year's Academy Awards\n\nIn pictures: Oscars 2017: The top red-carpet looks\n\nExplainer: Everything you need to know about how the big Best Picture blunder happened\n\nBut the mistake also produced the loudest and most awkward symbol of the transfer of power from old Hollywood to an industry that must reflect a more diverse America as the white guys were literally forced to hand over their prizes. After two years of the #OscarsSoWhite controversy, the 89th Academy Awards embraced African-American talent.\n\nMoonlight director Barry Jenkins had made the point directly earlier in the evening when he and Tarell Alvin McCraney, the dramatist on whose play the film is based, accepted the Oscar for best adapted screenplay.\n\nJenkins promised that both the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences and the American Civil Liberties Union would support people \u201cwho feel like there\u2019s no mirror for you\u201d for the next four years, in a reference to Donald Trump\u2019s term as president.\n\nMcCraney echoed his words, saying: \u201cThis goes out to all those black and brown boys and girls and non-gender-conforming who don\u2019t see themselves, we\u2019re trying to show you you, and us.\u201d\n\nThose were among the most overt political statements during an evening that would have disappointed anyone who tuned in hoping that liberal Hollywood would be on fire with righteous indignation against the new president.\n\nAside from a few predictable jabs from host Jimmy Kimmel, joking over his concern that Trump was not tweeting about the show, the references to the state of American politics were veiled beneath many passing salutes to diversity, empathy and humanity.\n\nWinning for best supporting actress in Fences, a tearful Viola Davis said that as an artist she belongs to \u201cthe only profession that celebrates what it means to live a life,\u201d and praised playwright August Wilson (from whose play Fences was adapted) as a writer \u201cwho exhumed and exalted the ordinary people.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, presenting that award, British actor Mark Rylance made a few telling comments about the ways in which supporting actors actually often play in opposition to main characters and that opposing without hating seems to be something women are particularly good at.\n\nAmong these more delicate notes, the largest political gesture of the evening sounded rather flat, perhaps because people could guess it would be coming: The Iranian feature The Salesman won best foreign-language film and director Asghar Farhadi was not there to accept the award.\n\nHe had said he would stay away to protest Trump\u2019s travel and immigration ban against citizens of Iran and six other Muslim-majority countries. Instead, Iranian-American businesswoman Anousheh Ansari read out a statement from Farhadi in which he denounced the ban, and the anti-democratic nature of us-versus-them fear mongering before arguing that film transmits shared human values.\n\nApplause followed but the protest felt anti-climactic.\n\nMeanwhile, Kimmel\u2019s risk-free shtick got more and more clubby as he included much inside joking about his dislike of Matt Damon (Who knew? Who cared?) and a gag in which a busload of supposedly awestruck tourists was unloaded into the celebrity-studded auditorium.\n\nBy the time Casey Affleck was picking up his Oscar for best actor, have neatly side-stepped controversy over a sexual harassment suit he settled in 2010, things were getting painful. As the shambling Affleck confessed, \u201cMan, I wish I had something bigger and more meaningful to say,\u201d many viewers might have agreed heartily.\n\nWithout fireworks or grandstanding or even a La La Land landslide, it was turning into a dull evening all round with Academy voters spreading the goodies around, giving both best original score and best original song to La La Land while offering best original screenplay to Manchester by the Sea and best adapted screenplay to Moonlight.\n\nThe awards to Davis and Mahershala Ali of Moonlight meant that African American actors won both best supporting categories while whites (Affleck and Stone) won the best acting categories.\n\nLa La Land also won cinematography and took the directing prize for Damien Chazelle. Perhaps that should have been somebody\u2019s clue that the La La Landers were in for a nasty surprise: In recent years, the Academy has often, rather illogically, split the best director and best picture prizes between two front runners.\n\nStill, in this year when the Oscars hoped to get a ratings bump from those who tuned in expecting controversy, there was nothing much to keep a tired viewer watching after 11 p.m. ET. Yet if you made the mistake of turning off the TV and going to bed you would have missed the oddest Oscar moment ever as Horowitz announced: \u201cThere\u2019s a mistake. Moonlight. You guys won best picture.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is not a joke,\u201d he assured the audience as Jenkins and Moonlight\u2019s producers began their move towards the stage.\n\nNo, it\u2019s no joke.

That\u2019s because he belongs to the minority Ahmadi sect.\n\nIn countries such as Malaysia and Pakistan, Ahmadis are reviled by hardline Sunni Muslim groups as heretics, apostates and even infidels.\n\nSo much so that Maleeha Lodhi, Pakistan\u2019s envoy to the United Nations, deleted a tweet on Monday that noted Ali was the first Muslim actor to win an Academy Award. The tweet, however, was spotted by eagle eyed Twitter users who saved screen grabs.\n\nScreen grab of the tweet on Mahershala Ali that was deleted by Maleeha Lodi, Pakistan\u2019s envoy to the UN. (Twitter)\n\nAli, who was born a Christian, converted to Islam in his final year at graduate school after the woman who would become his wife, Amatus Karim, invited him to an Ahmadi mosque.\n\nIn Pakistan, the government of then Prime Minister Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto was pressured by religious hardliners to amend the Constitution in 1974 to declare members of the Ahmadiyya sect \u201cnon-Muslims\u201d.\n\nAnother constitutional amendment by military ruler Zia-ul-Haq in 1984 further restricted religious freedoms of Ahmadis, who were barred from referring to themselves as Muslims and from calling their places of worship mosques. Anyone doing so could be sent to prison for three years.\n\nEven now, every Pakistani applying for a passport has to sign a declaration that states Prophet Mohammed was the final prophet and that Mirza Ghulam Ahmad, the founder of the Ahmadiyya sect, an \u201cimposter nabi\u201d (false prophet) and his followers \u201cnon-Muslims\u201d.\n\nWho are the Ahmadis?\n\nThe Ahmadi or Ahmadiyya sect takes its name from Mirza Ghulam Ahmad, who was born on February 13, 1835 in the town of Qadian in Gurdaspur district, currently in Indian Punjab. In Pakistan, the derogatory terms \u201cQadiani\u201d and \u201cMirzai\u201d are often used to refer to Ahmadis.\n\nGhulam Ahmad angered other Muslims when he claimed he had been chosen by Allah as the \u201cMahdi\u201d or messiah in the late 1880s. His followers too regarded him as a prophet, further angering Sunnis who considered this heretical as they believed Prophet Mohammed was the final prophet.\n\nHe died in Lahore in May 1908 and was buried in Qadian. During Partition in 1947, Ghulam Ahmad\u2019s followers shifted the movement\u2019s religious headquarters from Qadian to Rabwah in Pakistani Punjab, which they projected as their \u201cpromised land\u201d.\n\nBut less than a decade later, Ahmadis were targeted in violent riots in Lahore in 1953 that followed protests spearheaded by groups such as the Jamaat-e-Islami.\n\nRead more\n\nFollowing years of persecution, the Ahmadis moved their central headquarters to London. The sect now has adherents in Britain, the US and African and European countries though there are no reliable numbers for the followers.\n\nIn Pakistan, Ahmadis continue to be targeted by religious hardliners and terror groups. In May 2010, nearly 100 Ahmadis were killed in near simultaneous terror attacks on two mosques of the sect in Lahore.\n\nThe country\u2019s only Nobel laureate, Abdus Salam, who played a key role in the nuclear programme and whose work led to the discovery of the so-called God Particle, has been shunned in Pakistan because he was an Ahmadi. More recently, army chief Gen Qamar Bajwa was the target of a vicious whisper campaign that claimed he was an Ahmadi because his wife reportedly has some Ahmadi relatives.\n\nBesides Pakistan, members of the sect have also faced persecution in Bangladesh, Malaysia and Indonesia, where the country\u2019s top Islamic body declared Ahmadis as \u201cdeviants\u201d in 2008.\n\nFollow @htshowbiz for more",

Yet somehow, even the embarrassing moment pivoted into grace.\n\nAs confusion and bafflement overwhelmed those in the Dolby Theatre and at home on their couches, \"Moonlight\" director Barry Jenkins and \"La La Land\" director Damien Chazelle shared a hug on the back of the stage, out of sight from the television cameras.\n\n\"The folks of 'La La Land' were so gracious. I can't imagine being in their position and having to do that,\" Jenkins told reporters backstage. \"It was unfortunate that things happened as they did but, goddamn, we won best picture.\"\n\nOscar tabulators PwC, in their 83rd year providing the service to the academy, later apologized to all in a statement and are investigating why it happened.\n\nThere's no denying, though, that \"Moonlight's\" win over \"La La Land\" was a massive upset, made only more pointed by the envelope gaffe. Chazelle's candy-colored musical was widely presumed to be a shoo-in for the top prize after its record-tying 14 nominations and a relative sweep of award season. The film still won six Oscars, including best director for Chazelle, who at 32 became the youngest ever to take the prize, and for score, song (\"City of Stars\") and actress to Emma Stone.\n\nThe actress, who pledged her deep love of \"Moonlight,\" said later, \"Is that the craziest Oscar moment of all time? Cool!\"",
