        "body1": "Section 18C: What's all the fuss and why does it matter?\n\nUpdated\n\n18C? Never heard of it? Means nothing to you? You're not alone.\n\nDeputy Prime Minister and National Party leader Barnaby Joyce says people aren't stopping him in the street about it.\n\nA couple of weeks ago filming for the ABC TV program, The Link, we asked people: what was important to them?\n\nThere was lots of talk about health, education, housing; no-one mentioned 18C.\n\nI asked one man \u2014 articulate and informed on issues like cutting penalty rates and immigration law \u2014 directly about changes to the Racial Discrimination Act, and he said he had no idea what it was about.\n\nSo, why all the fuss?\n\nYou could ask: why am I even writing about this? I am chewing up more column inches on something that is far from a first order issue in people's daily lives.\n\nBut, I'd argue, this isn't really about changes to an obscure piece of law. It is about something more fundamental; it is about how we live together. It is the test of pluralism in a globalised world.\n\n'The return of history'\n\nWe are witnessing waves of migration; borders are flimsy if not often obsolete. We are rubbing up against each other \u2014 religions, races, cultures.\n\nInternational Relations professor Jennifer Welsh has dubbed this \"the return of history\" \u2014 a rejoinder to political scientist Francis Fukuyama's thesis that the end of the Cold War was the final victory of Western liberal democracy and \"the end of history\" \u2014 a resurgence of tribalism, nationalism and sectarianism.\n\nAll of this at a time of information revolution. It can be an incendiary mix.\n\nPhilosopher Timothy Garton Ash calls this the \"Cosmopolis\": a mixed-up, connected, world-city.\n\nIt is the 21st century version of media guru Marshall McLuhan's \"global-village\".\n\nIn this Cosmopolis there are more phones than human beings and half of humankind is connected to the internet. Mr Garton Ash says this has unleashed the, \"evils of unlimited free expression \u2026 across frontiers\".\n\nThere have been celebrated \u2014 frightening \u2014 cases. In 1989, Salman Rushdie was forced into hiding as the Iranian Ayatollah issued a fatwa \u2014 a death warrant \u2014 against the author for his work The Satanic Verses, deemed blasphemous to Islam.\n\nIn 2005, there was the Danish cartoon furore. Depictions of the prophet Muhammad in a Danish newspaper sparked global protests. I recall being in a remote town in Pakistan reporting for CNN and seeing people marching and chanting down the main street.\n\nIn 2015, the world was stunned by the attack on French satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo; terrorists opened fire killing 12 people and injuring 11 others.\n\nMr Garton Ash says we live in a world where, \"a man publishes something in one country and a man dies in another \u2026 In this disturbing way, too, we are all neighbours now\".\n\nThe ultimate check on government\n\nMr Garton Ash says this is an enormous challenge to the idea of free speech. His 2016 book, Free Speech, set out what he called 10 principles for a connected world.\n\nIt is a book well worth reading as the debate about 18C ramps up. The Government is moving to amend the law \u2014 remove the current words \"offend, insult and humiliate\" and insert instead \"harass and intimidate\".\n\nThe Government argues this will make it \"fairer\", believing the law is out of step with the standards of a \"reasonable member of the community\".\n\nThe conservative wing of the Liberal Party \u2014 albeit not alone \u2014 has led the push for change. Supporters point to recent cases here \u2014 notably the action against late cartoonist Bill Leak, who was accused of racism for his illustration depicting an Aboriginal derelict dad.\n\nThey argue the bar for offence had been set too low, leading to frivolous or vexatious cases dragged before the Human Rights Commission.\n\nIt is a contemporary twist on an old argument. Speech is central to humanity, as Mr Garton Ash says: \"It separates us from other animals and, thus far, from computers.\"\n\nFree speech can be the ultimate check on government. I have worked in countries where the government silences the people. As a reporter I have been arrested and seen other people go to jail for daring to challenge this authority.\n\nThe free trade of ideas\n\nBut what is good speech and what is bad speech? Who decides?\n\nWe all remember that lesson from childhood: sticks and stones may break my bones but names will never hurt me. In the grown-up world, of course, names can indeed hurt.\n\nMr Garton Ash says most of contemporary Western debates about free speech pivot on the issues of harm and offence.\n\nOf course free speech does not mean unlimited speech. There should be laws against inciting violence.\n\nThe right to offend, in a civil society, should also mean the exercise of good taste and judgment.\n\nBut libertarians say no-one should be free from offence and that government has no place regulating it.\n\nMr Garton Ash points out that in countries where there is heavy regulation of hate speech, hatred remains undiminished.\n\nHe argues ultimately for people to develop thicker skins. He says in our connected Cosmopolis we need more free speech, not less.\n\nHe calls for a mixture of openness and robust civility. This means tolerating beliefs, values, lifestyles; and opinions that we might find profoundly disturbing.\n\nBy guaranteeing one person's freedom of speech, we protect the speech of all.\n\nIn this way, argument can be met with counter-argument.\n\nThis is the tradition of legendary US Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, that the ultimate good is reached by the free trade of ideas.\n\nTopics: discrimination, government-and-politics, sydney-2000\n\nFirst posted",

The Pies have been further depleted for the clash clash against the Bulldogs with the ruling out of Jamie Elliott and Levi Greenwood.\n\nDe Goey had already been under an injury cloud because of a quad issue that limited his availability during the JLT Community series.\n\nElliott ost his race against time to overcome a niggling ankle injury suffered at training last month. The Pies said the small forward was expected to return to the senior team soon, having missed all of last year with a back issue.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBuckley said Elliott was unlikely to face Richmond in round two but hadn't yet been ruled out of that match.\n\nGreenwood was due to undergo hip surgery on Monday, and is tipped to miss four to five weeks.\n\nDe Goey's injury isn't' the first time Collingwood have been \"dogged\" by this sort of problem.

We prepare the depth of the squad to play roles as expected and as required,\" Buckley said.\n\n\"We're going to leave some blokes out that deserve to play this week.

He's been with us for all of his career as a father-son and to see him that first JLT game against Melbourne with a No. 13 guernsey in a Dogs jumper was different.\"\n\nBut Buckley thought that relationships with Cloke would be put aside come the night of the game.\n\n\"He really is another opposition player when you get to game day.

May he rest in peace,\" he said.\n\nMrs May said Mr McGuinness was key to bringing the republican movement away from violence.\n\n\"While I can never condone the path he took in the earlier part of his life, Martin McGuinness ultimately played a defining role in leading the republican movement away from violence,\" she said.\n\nBut Stephen Gault, whose father Samuel died in the IRA's notorious Poppy Day bombing in Enniskillen in 1987, said he would remember Mr McGuinness only as a \"terrorist\".\n\n\"If he had been repentant, my thoughts might have been slightly different,\" he said.\n\n\"But he took to his grave proud that he served in the IRA. There was no remorse or repentance from him, even up to his death.\"\n\nMr Blair said: \"Once he became the peacemaker he became it wholeheartedly.\"\n\nMr McGuinness's last major act as a politician was to pull down the powersharing executive at Stormont when he resigned as deputy first minister in January in protest at the DUP's handling of a green energy scandal.\n\nThe move forced Mrs Foster from office. Ten days later, showing signs of physical frailty, he announced his retirement from front line politics.\n\nMrs Foster, who was caught up in an IRA bomb attack as a schoolgirl and whose father survived a republican murder bid, reached out to Mr McGuinness during the recent Stormont election campaign as his health deteriorated.\n\n\"We did of course have very different backgrounds and I think it would be wrong not to acknowledge that and the fact we did have those different life experiences,\" she said.\n\n\"But at the same time we did have a desire to see things work here at Stormont and to make devolved government work for everybody.\"\n\nMr Robinson, who served alongside Mr McGuinness for seven years, said no other republican could have done what he did while sharing power.\n\n\"Yet while I knew his past, as he knew mine, we never doubted or gave up our shared commitment to create a new and better era in Northern Ireland politics,\" he said.\n\nDuring their time in office as first and deputy first minister, Mr Paisley and Mr McGuinness earned the nickname the \"Chuckle brothers\".\n\nIan Paisley Jnr, who as a junior minister worked alongside his father and the Sinn Fein veteran during their time jointly leading the Stormont executive, said he had gone from viewing Mr McGuinness as the \"godfather of the IRA\" to considering him a personal friend.\n\n\"I think the Christian view in life is how a person's journey started is of course important, but it is how it finishes which is actually more important,\" he said.\n\nPresident of Ireland Michael D Higgins led tributes from the Irish Republic, saying Mr McGuinness's death left a gap that would be hard to fill.\n\nMr Kenny said: \"Not only did Martin come to believe that peace must prevail, he committed himself to working tirelessly to that end.\"", 
        "body0": "And on May 8, 2007, a day many thought would never come, the Rev. Ian Paisley, who had founded the Democratic Unionist Party and had long stood for continued Ulster association with Britain, and Mr. McGuinness, who had fought for Ulster\u2019s incorporation into a united Ireland, took oaths as the leader and deputy leader, respectively, of Northern Ireland\u2019s power-sharing government.\n\nAs Prime Ministers Tony Blair of Britain and Bertie Ahern of Ireland looked on, the proceedings ended direct British control of Northern Ireland and reinstated home rule for its 1.8 million people. Legislative power was vested in a Northern Ireland Assembly, and Ulster began a new era in which long-bitter adversaries pledged to abandon armed struggles and embrace political solutions.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe I.R.A. had already destroyed its weapons and given up its clandestine cells, and Sinn Fein (pronounced shin-FAIN) had endorsed a reconstituted Ulster police force, which it had regarded for decades as an arm of British and Protestant repression.\n\nPhoto\n\nLeft unresolved was whether Northern Ireland would ever be reunited with the predominantly Catholic Irish Republic. The Good Friday Agreement provided that that could happen only with the consent of Northern Ireland, and it made it likely that Ulster and its Protestant majority would remain in perpetuity \u2014 along with the legacies of killings and religious enmities.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOnce banned from entering Britain, Mr. McGuinness won a seat in the House of Commons in London; ran unsuccessfully for the presidency of Ireland in 2011; visited prime ministers several times at 10 Downing Street; met Presidents Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama at the White House; and shook hands twice with Queen Elizabeth II.\n\n\u201cThis is the side of his political life that McGuinness wants the Irish people to remember: the reformed man, the young, hotheaded idealist who learned the error of his ways and forged peace, an achievement that still wins him plaudits from around the world,\u201d the British magazine New Statesman said in 2011. \u201cTo some in Ireland he is a hero \u2014 a man who stood up for the oppressed, who fought the British. To others, he was, is and will always be a criminal.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nJames Martin Pacelli McGuinness was born in Derry, Northern Ireland, on May 23, 1950, one of seven children of William and Peggy McGuinness, a Catholic family that shared two bedrooms and an outdoor toilet in the crowded slum of Bogside, a setting for much violence during the Troubles. His father worked in an iron foundry, and his mother in a shirt factory. The parents attended Mass and took communion daily, and they gathered their six sons and daughter nightly for a recitation of the rosary.\n\nMartin was a bright, eager boy who loved the poems of W. B. Yeats and played chess, but he failed the 11 Plus exams in his last year in grade school. So instead of getting an academic education, he went to a Christian Brothers technical school, where the boys were beaten. He quit school at 15 and became a butcher\u2019s assistant. Like many Bogside youths, he joined the lionized I.R.A. and was a gunman at 18.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn the late 1960s and early \u201970s, Bogside was a war zone of hatred and revenge. Stone-throwing youths were beaten by the Royal Ulster Constabulary. There were riots and protests. Two boys were shot dead by British soldiers in 1971. The Provisional I.R.A., the more militant successor to the I.R.A., launched ferocious counterattacks. Arson fires burned 100 shops, and snipers killed 26 British soldiers in Derry alone in 1971 and \u201972.\n\nMr. McGuinness was second in command of the Derry I.R.A. on Bloody Sunday, the grim day in 1972 when British troops fired on unarmed civilians staging a peaceful protest against the British practice of internment without trials. Fourteen people were killed in what became known as the Bogside Massacre.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn 1973 and 1974, Mr. McGuinness was imprisoned twice, for possession of a car filled with explosives and ammunition, and for his acknowledged membership in the illegal I.R.A.\n\nPhoto\n\nIn 1974, he married Bernadette Canning. They had four children: daughters Grainne and Fionnuala, and sons Fiachra and Emmet. There was no immediate word on his survivors.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nFrom the late 1970s to the mid-\u201980s, Mr. McGuinness was widely assumed to be the I.R.A.\u2019s chief of staff. Hundreds of people were killed by the I.R.A. in that period, including the queen\u2019s cousin Earl Mountbatten, whose fishing boat exploded off County Sligo in 1979. Many I.R.A. attacks also occurred in England, including a bombing at a Brighton hotel in 1984 that killed five people and was intended to assassinate Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and her cabinet.\n\nMr. McGuinness was accused of participating in or plotting crimes. Television documentaries and news and magazine articles linked him to murders of informers and bombings that killed scores. He and Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein\u2019s president, reportedly concluded in the early 1990s that militance was not advancing their aims. Cease-fires in 1994 and 1997 ensued, and talks led to the peace accords.\n\nMr. McGuinness was minister of education in an interim government from 1999 to 2002. Elected to the House of Commons in London in 1997, he was re-elected in 2001, 2005 and 2010 and served until 2013. A biography, \u201cMartin McGuinness: From Guns to Government,\u201d by Liam Clarke and Kathryn Johnston, appeared in 2001.\n\nAs senior officials of Northern Ireland, he and Mr. Paisley became friends of sorts. When Mr. Paisley retired in 2008, Mr. McGuinness gave him a Seamus Heaney poem. After a decade as deputy first minister, Mr. McGuinness resigned in January for health reasons, prompting a snap election in which Sinn Fein made major gains and nearly overtook the Democratic Unionists as the largest party in the regional assembly.\n\n\u201cHe retires without his dream of a united Ireland being fulfilled during his tenure,\u201d Daniel McConnell, political editor of The Irish Examiner, wrote. \u201cBut his contribution to peace on this island will be long remembered.\u201d",

        "body1": "Section 18C: What's all the fuss and why does it matter?\n\nUpdated\n\n18C? Never heard of it? Means nothing to you? You're not alone.\n\nDeputy Prime Minister and National Party leader Barnaby Joyce says people aren't stopping him in the street about it.\n\nA couple of weeks ago filming for the ABC TV program, The Link, we asked people: what was important to them?\n\nThere was lots of talk about health, education, housing; no-one mentioned 18C.\n\nI asked one man \u2014 articulate and informed on issues like cutting penalty rates and immigration law \u2014 directly about changes to the Racial Discrimination Act, and he said he had no idea what it was about.\n\nSo, why all the fuss?\n\nYou could ask: why am I even writing about this? I am chewing up more column inches on something that is far from a first order issue in people's daily lives.\n\nBut, I'd argue, this isn't really about changes to an obscure piece of law. It is about something more fundamental; it is about how we live together. It is the test of pluralism in a globalised world.\n\n'The return of history'\n\nWe are witnessing waves of migration; borders are flimsy if not often obsolete. We are rubbing up against each other \u2014 religions, races, cultures.\n\nInternational Relations professor Jennifer Welsh has dubbed this \"the return of history\" \u2014 a rejoinder to political scientist Francis Fukuyama's thesis that the end of the Cold War was the final victory of Western liberal democracy and \"the end of history\" \u2014 a resurgence of tribalism, nationalism and sectarianism.\n\nAll of this at a time of information revolution. It can be an incendiary mix.\n\nPhilosopher Timothy Garton Ash calls this the \"Cosmopolis\": a mixed-up, connected, world-city.\n\nIt is the 21st century version of media guru Marshall McLuhan's \"global-village\".\n\nIn this Cosmopolis there are more phones than human beings and half of humankind is connected to the internet. Mr Garton Ash says this has unleashed the, \"evils of unlimited free expression \u2026 across frontiers\".\n\nThere have been celebrated \u2014 frightening \u2014 cases. In 1989, Salman Rushdie was forced into hiding as the Iranian Ayatollah issued a fatwa \u2014 a death warrant \u2014 against the author for his work The Satanic Verses, deemed blasphemous to Islam.\n\nIn 2005, there was the Danish cartoon furore. Depictions of the prophet Muhammad in a Danish newspaper sparked global protests. I recall being in a remote town in Pakistan reporting for CNN and seeing people marching and chanting down the main street.\n\nIn 2015, the world was stunned by the attack on French satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo; terrorists opened fire killing 12 people and injuring 11 others.\n\nMr Garton Ash says we live in a world where, \"a man publishes something in one country and a man dies in another \u2026 In this disturbing way, too, we are all neighbours now\".\n\nThe ultimate check on government\n\nMr Garton Ash says this is an enormous challenge to the idea of free speech. His 2016 book, Free Speech, set out what he called 10 principles for a connected world.\n\nIt is a book well worth reading as the debate about 18C ramps up. The Government is moving to amend the law \u2014 remove the current words \"offend, insult and humiliate\" and insert instead \"harass and intimidate\".\n\nThe Government argues this will make it \"fairer\", believing the law is out of step with the standards of a \"reasonable member of the community\".\n\nThe conservative wing of the Liberal Party \u2014 albeit not alone \u2014 has led the push for change. Supporters point to recent cases here \u2014 notably the action against late cartoonist Bill Leak, who was accused of racism for his illustration depicting an Aboriginal derelict dad.\n\nThey argue the bar for offence had been set too low, leading to frivolous or vexatious cases dragged before the Human Rights Commission.\n\nIt is a contemporary twist on an old argument. Speech is central to humanity, as Mr Garton Ash says: \"It separates us from other animals and, thus far, from computers.\"\n\nFree speech can be the ultimate check on government. I have worked in countries where the government silences the people. As a reporter I have been arrested and seen other people go to jail for daring to challenge this authority.\n\nThe free trade of ideas\n\nBut what is good speech and what is bad speech? Who decides?\n\nWe all remember that lesson from childhood: sticks and stones may break my bones but names will never hurt me. In the grown-up world, of course, names can indeed hurt.\n\nMr Garton Ash says most of contemporary Western debates about free speech pivot on the issues of harm and offence.\n\nOf course free speech does not mean unlimited speech. There should be laws against inciting violence.\n\nThe right to offend, in a civil society, should also mean the exercise of good taste and judgment.\n\nBut libertarians say no-one should be free from offence and that government has no place regulating it.\n\nMr Garton Ash points out that in countries where there is heavy regulation of hate speech, hatred remains undiminished.\n\nHe argues ultimately for people to develop thicker skins. He says in our connected Cosmopolis we need more free speech, not less.\n\nHe calls for a mixture of openness and robust civility. This means tolerating beliefs, values, lifestyles; and opinions that we might find profoundly disturbing.\n\nBy guaranteeing one person's freedom of speech, we protect the speech of all.\n\nIn this way, argument can be met with counter-argument.\n\nThis is the tradition of legendary US Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, that the ultimate good is reached by the free trade of ideas.\n\nTopics: discrimination, government-and-politics, sydney-2000\n\nFirst posted",

        "body2": "Dragging out debate about Australia's race hate laws will cost the Coalition votes, Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce has warned during an hour long debate in the Coalition party room.\n\nCoalition agrees to push 18C changes, despite warning from Joyce Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull addressed the party room at Parliament House in Canberra on Tuesday 29 November 2016 Photo: Andrew Meares Photo: Andrew Meares Tweet Facebook of \u2573 exit\n\nAustralia's race hate laws have lost credibility, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull says, and fixing them requires the removal of legal prohibitions on people's right to \"offend, insult or humiliate\", while making it illegal to \"harass\".\n\nIn a move that has delighted the right of the Coalition and dismayed MPs who hold marginal seats or represent ethnic communities, Mr Turnbull and Attorney-General George Brandis unveiled changes to the language of section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act.\n\nChanges to how the Human Rights Commission handles complaints under the Racial Discrimination Act are also on the way.\n\nThe Commission president, currently Gillian Triggs, will have to rule early on whether a complaint has merit and should proceed; complaints will have to be lodged within six months of an incident, and then dealt with more quickly - within 12 months.\n\nMr Turnbull said the changes would strengthen freedom of speech in Australia and ensure protection from racism.\n\n\"We are defending Australians from racial vilification by replacing language which has lost credibility,\" he said.\n\n\"We need to restore confidence to the Racial Discrimination Act and to the Human Rights Commission's administration of it.\"\n\n\"This is an issue of values - free speech, free speech is a value at the very core of our party. It should be at the core of every party. Ensuring Australians are protected from racial vilification, likewise, is part of the mutual respect of which I often speak.\"\n\nMr Turnbull would not say if it would be acceptable to call someone a \"wog\" under the proposed changes, and declined to repeat the term when put to him.\n\nThe Prime Minister predicted Labor would \"cynically and ruthlessly\" exploit the proposed changes, which, will - unusually - first be introduced in the Senate by Senator Brandis.\n\nLabor's Tony Burke suggested the bill would go to the Senate first because \"if they can't get it through the Senate, they don't want to force their own back bench to have to vote for it\"\n\nThe proposed changes to the wording of the act, which bring to a head years of debate, are all but certain to be defeated in the Senate by Labor, the Greens and the Nick Xenophon Team.\n\nThey will also trigger a campaign from activist group GetUp!, concern ethnic communities, who strongly opposed the changes back in 2014, and win support from free market think tank the Institute of Public Affairs.\n\nEarlier, during debate in the Coalition party room, Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce warned that dragging out debate on the issue could cost the Coalition votes.\n\nFormer prime minister Tony Abbott praised Mr Turnbull and Senator Brandis during the party room discussion, while Development Minister Concetta Fierravanti-Wells warned changing section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act would be very unpopular with multicultural communities.\n\nThe proposal will see the words \"offend, insult and humiliate\" removed from the act and replaced by \"harass\" while \"intimidate\" will remain.\n\nThe debate about changing Australia's race hate laws was held on National Harmony Day and the International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination.\n\nMr Joyce's warning to the party room was in line with similar comments he has made about the fractious same-sex marriage debate - that, essentially, voters are not concerned about section 18C but are more concerned about day to day issues and that the Coalition should stop talking about the issue.\n\nSeveral MPs rose to disagree with Mr Joyce, including South Australian Liberal Tony Pasin and WA Liberal Andrew Hastie.\n\nSources in the room told Fairfax Media that Mr Hastie argued changing 18C was about \"de-fanging the operational arm of the political correctness movement in this country\".\n\nMr Pasin disagreed with Mr Joyce and said voters in his electorate raised the issue with him.\n\nAbout 20 MPs spoke during the meeting and the strong majority ultimately agreed with the package of changes, which was ticked off by cabinet on Monday night.\n\nThose who argued for change included leading proponents Tim Wilson and James Paterson, Mr Abbott, Eric Abetz, Mr Pasin, Mr Hastie and George Christensen.\n\nThose who spoke against changing the wording of the act included MPs Craig Laundy, David Coleman, Ann Sudmalis and John Alexander.\n\nMr Laundy, who holds the marginal western Sydney seat of Reid, told ABC radio before the meeting that he would stand up for his multicultural electorate during the debate and that he was comfortable with section 18C of the act.\n\nSenator Abetz released a statement after the meeting praising the proposed changes: \"These common-sense reforms will go a long way to ensuring that Australians can engage in free speech while maintaining protections against racially motivated harassment and intimidation\".\n\nOpposition Leader Bill Shorten, meanwhile, told the Labor caucus meeting that the prime minister was moving ahead with changes to 18C - and penalty rates - because \"they'll never affect him\".\n\nFollow us on Facebook\n\nFollow James Massola on Facebook\n\nThe story Coalition agrees to push 18C changes, despite warning from Joyce first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.",

        "body2": "West Coast Eagles in spotlight again as report on prior drug culture at AFL club prompts questions\n\nUpdated\n\nQuestions have been raised about why a leaked report detailing the drug culture inside the West Coast Eagles in the mid 2000s was kept secret for almost a decade.\n\nThe 83-page report documents one of the best and worst chapters in West Coast's history, with the club winning the 2006 premiership but also forced to deal with a string of off-field problems.\n\nIt comes a day after one of the club's biggest stars of the era, Ben Cousins, was remanded in custody and sent back to jail after pleading guilty to drug and stalking offences.\n\nFormer sports writer at The West Australian Ken Casellas said the report \u2014 published in full by Melbourne's Herald Sun newspaper \u2014 should have been made public 10 years ago.\n\n\"Unfortunately there is a very strong suspicion that there had been a cover-up,\" he said.\n\n\"That officials at football clubs, notably the West Coast Eagles, did turn a blind eye because some of the players were absolute superstars, they were match-winners.\n\n\"They appeared to me and to a lot of other people too that they thought they were untouchable because they were wonderful footballers.\"\n\nWritten by retired Victorian Supreme Court judge William Gillard, the report described multiple claims of drug-related misconduct.\n\nOne of the worst was about the team's 2006 end of season trip to Las Vegas.\n\nIn the years since, former star Chad Fletcher has revealed he collapsed and almost died on the trip.\n\nJustice Gillard detailed how players and club officials were evasive when he tried to ask them about the incident, saying the club tried to ignore any suggestion of drug taking.\n\nThe report also revealed every player except Cousins denied taking illicit drugs.\n\nOverall, it painted a picture of a group of young men who were treated as rock stars in Perth and that the fishbowl environment they lived in led them to believe they were infallible.\n\nScrub out the 2006 flag: Bartlett\n\nFormer Richmond great Kevin Bartlett told SEN radio the report called the club's 2006 premiership into question.\n\n\"Those most hurt by today's Herald Sun story are now Essendon coach John Worsfold, then the coach of the Eagles, and CEO of West Coast Trevor Nisbett, for clearly Judge Gillard felt they did not act strongly enough on compelling evidence,\" he said.\n\n\"With what we've known in the past and observed with new stories over the years regarding troubled times for the West Coast Eagles players, I've had an asterisk next to their 2006 premiership win.\n\n\"After reading Judge Gillard's report \u2026 I'm taking away that asterisk and putting a black line through that flag.\"\n\nBut speaking on 3AW, Worsfold accused Bartlett of making an \"emotional comment on part of the information that he's elected to believe\".\n\n\"He doesn't know the full story, not by a long shot,\" Worsfold said.\n\n\"If he was there and part of it and understood everything, I think he'd have a different opinion.\"\n\nWorsfold also defended the actions taken by the Eagles.\n\n\"I'm sure at any workplace in the country if you quizzed your staff on a question on whether they've ever used illicit drugs, I know the answer you're probably going to get,\" he said.\n\n\"Then it's up to every individual as to how much faith they put in that.\"\n\nPremiership built on hard work: Judd\n\nFormer Eagles premiership skipper Chris Judd also rejected Bartlett's comments.\n\n\"I've heard it before. From my perspective I was there, I know just how hard we trained for it and what everyone put into it and just what a great achievement it was,\" he told Triple M.\n\n\"There's no suggestion that anybody used performance enhancing drugs, which obviously would've tainted the premiership.\n\n\"The premiership was built on hard work and was certainly my proudest moment in AFL footy.\"\n\nJudd acknowledged Cousins was still dealing with a very public battle with drugs but argued most of his former Eagles teammates were fine.\n\n\"Obviously Cousins' story is tragic and very hard to watch unfold, but most of the other guys are going well and moved on with their lives and are working hard on the next chapter,\" he said.\n\nThe AFL has declined to comment on the leaked report.\n\nTopics: australian-football-league, sport, drugs-and-substance-abuse, wa, perth-6000\n\nFirst posted",
