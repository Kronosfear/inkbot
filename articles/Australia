The timber is there, we want to keep working.\"\n\nThe sawmill processes 150,000 cubic metres of timber a year, bought from the state-owned logging company VicForests, but its supply contract is about to expire.\n\nVicForests is only offering half that amount of timber in a new contract, saying there is not enough forest to log.\n\nHowever, chief executive of ASH Vince Hurley said the timber was there but the Government has locked it up by increasing the areas of protected forests.\n\n\"At the moment in public forests in Victoria, 94 per cent of forest is not able to be touched,\" he said.\n\n\"So 6 per cent we're in ... and one eightieth of that 6 per cent is harvested and regenerated per year.\n\n\"Progressively more and more reserves have been created, so that has eaten into that 6 per cent.\"\n\nMr Hurley said the mill needed a critical mass of at least 130,000 hectares to be financially viable, as well as the security of a long-term contract.\n\nThe Wilderness Society (TWS) in Victoria countered ASH's claims saying it had spent two years in a taskforce process \"pleading\" with the mill to accept the deal on the table for the sake of its workers.\n\n\"Change is inevitable due to bushfire and decades over-logging, both of which are impacting forests and wood resource[s],\" TWS Victoria tweeted.\n\nClock ticking on 250 mill jobs\n\nThe company is also seeking $40 million from the Victorian Government to refit the mill, so that it can process the smaller logs from newer regrowth forests.\n\nIt said it planned to transition to plantation timber within 20 years.\n\nThe company set a four-week deadline for the Victorian Government to negotiate a deal, before it would begin to shut down the mill and lay off its 250 workers.\n\nThat deadline was then extended for another 10 days, but expires this week.\n\nMill supervisor Anthony Wilkes said he had been asking Mr Andrews to visit the site and meet with workers, but had not had a reply to his requests.\n\n\"I've chased him down a couple of times, once at the Morwell police station and also at the Morwell Bowls Club the Friday once gone to hopefully get him to give us some answers,\" he said.\n\nMr Andrews was asked about the Heyfield mill at another media event on Tuesday morning.\n\n\"I met with a couple of Heyfield workers just over the course of the weekend, actually,\" he said.\n\n\"We've been doing more than talking though, we've been working very closely with the company.

        "body0": "The iconic beer brand says it is prioritising digital targeting and the creation of new sub-brands in a bid to make Guinness more attractive to young people.\n\nWhen you think of Guinness it\u2019s easy to imagine a pub full of distinguished middle-aged drinkers complimenting the bartender for the thickness of his pour. Yet, according to Rory Sheridan, head of sponsorship for Diageo in Western Europe, the iconic Irish stout is now attempting to steer away from its specialist tradition and to resonate more with a younger audience.\n\nWith the final weekend of the Rugby Six Nations Championship this weekend and this week\u2019s Cheltenham Festival \u2013 both events that Guinness sponsors \u2013 it\u2019s a busy time for the brand. And, speaking to Marketing Week, Sheridan says that moving forward it plans to use these sponsorships to introduce the new beverages it is creating.\n\nHe says the brand\u2019s Open Gate Brewery in Dublin has been prioritising the creation of new sub-brands such as Guinness West Indies Porter Ale and Hop House 13 lager; the latter marks the first new lager brand Guinness has launched since the 1960s. Although both are different types of beer they are made with the same Guinness yeast and a good chance to \u201ctap in\u201d to the craft beer revolution.\n\nREAD MORE: Diageo: We have the power to normalise gender equality\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been opening up the Dublin brewery to social media influencers to show we have a broader appeal. We\u2019re also prioritising the creation of new lagers and ales there, whether that\u2019s on a limited or permanent sales run,\u201d he explains. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt a younger drinker can find Guinness a challenging drink in terms of an entry-level beer, so that needs to be addressed.\u201d\n\nMaking the brand resonate with a female drinker is also a challenge for Guinness. One potential, Sheridan says, could be beer cocktails following \u201csuccessful trials\u201d among female drinkers. However, launching a more female-friendly beer sub-brand would be foolish.\n\n\u201cIf a woman wants to drink a beer, she will drink one without being told what to do. It is more about our marketing appealing to a broader non-demographic-specific audience and showing them Guinness can be enjoyed by anybody opposed to creating a female-focused liquid,\u201d he says.\n\nMade of More\n\nOne way the marketing of Guinness is evolving is through its Made of More positioning, which prioritises touching stories rather than the artistic punch of previous iconic campaigns such as Surfer and its wave-bound horses. Around the 2015 Rugby World Cup, for example, the beer brand\u2019s TV campaign focused on the story of Welsh rugby legend Gavin Thomas and how he bravely came out as homosexual to his teammates.\n\nWhen we speak, people listen, so we have a massive duty of care not to mess around with their expectation for Guinness to act with integrity. Rory Sheridan, Diageo\n\nSheridan says this new positioning is here to stay and that Guinness has no plans to simply flirt with being purposeful. \u201cAround the time of the financial crash, we did lots of research on how the Guinness brand can stay relevant for the next 20 years,\u201d he explains. \u201cAnd having substance in an era when the public are very cynical of major organisations was our number one takeaway.\n\n\u201cWith Guinness being this typically male-orientated brand, there was a need to be genderless and to instead focus on stories everybody can relate to; that\u2019s Made of More in a nutshell. Even if we change the slogan slightly, it will be a long-term focus. When we speak, people listen, so we have a massive duty of care not to mess around with their expectation for Guinness to act with integrity.\u201d\n\nTargeting and becoming ageless\n\nSheridan says Diageo wants Guinness to gain just as much fame from its advertising in social as it previously did in TV. Of this approach, he reveals: \u201cThe traditional marketing mix we\u2019re used to is something we are trying to step outside of more.\n\n\u201cWe want to be more impactful with our media spend and steer clear of a one size fits all approach, where a TV campaign is simply repeated down the funnel. It\u2019s not about reaching millions of people but reaching the right people through smart targeting and original content.\u201d\n\nUltimately, Guinness is ready to break away from tradition in its bid to appeal to drinkers of all ages. Sheridan concludes: \u201cGuinness really must become an ageless brand as it is important to recruit new people to the brand. If targeting younger drinkers through stuff such as our Boiler Room partnership means doing radically different advertising than the previous generation then that\u2019s what has to be done.\u201d",

But then this talented cricketer, grabbing a lifeline handed to him in Tests, responded with a mature and superbly-paced unbeaten 82.\n\nTwo to tango\n\nIt takes two to tango, and Smith and Maxwell combined to lift the Aussies from a troubling 140 for four to a more secure 299 without the loss of another wicket on the opening day of the third Test.\n\nThere wasn\u2019t much spin on the first day pitch \u2014 the little turn that the bowlers managed to extract was slow \u2014 but the odd ball definitely kept low. The first two days could be the best for batting here.\n\nIt was a difficult day for India. First Australia won what could prove a crucial toss. Then, India lost the services of its talismanic skipper Virat Kohli in the middle session.\n\nThe Indian skipper hurt his shoulder while diving to stop a racing ball close to the boundary ropes and had to leave the field. He will undergo a scan before the start of the second day.\n\nAjinkya Rahane led in Kohli\u2019s absence but the Indians did go off the boil subsequently. The intensity was not quite there.\n\nThe Aussies focused hard.\n\nUnder pressure and scrutiny after the \u2018DRS-gate\u2019 in Bengaluru, Smith faced 244 balls and struck 13 boundaries, blending defence with attack, and picking gaps with precision.\n\nHe has a flourishing back-lift that appears to start from fourth slip, however, Smith does bring the bat down straight and on time.\n\nA tendency to move towards the off-side leaves the leg-stump exposed but when the bowlers change their line to exploit this supposed weakness, he flicks and whips them for runs.\n\nSeventh quickest\n\nTo put it simply, Smith is not an easy batsman to bowl at. On a day when he reached 5000 Test runs in only his 97th innings \u2014 he is the seventh quickest to achieve the feat in terms of innings played \u2014 Smith applied himself and absorbed the pressure.\n\nAnd he scored on both sides of the wicket, whether driving Ishant Sharma through covers, back-cutting R. Ashwin or drilling Umesh Yadav and Ravindra Jadeja through mid-wicket. His 19th Test hundred was well deserved.\n\nWalking in to a crisis situation, Maxwell displayed great composure. He took his time to settle \u2014 Maxwell\u2019s initial runs came only in singles \u2014 and rotated the strike with the smartness of an experienced campaigner.\n\nAn element of solidity in Maxwell\u2019s batting was unmistakable. This nimble-footed batsman reined in his aggressive instincts and built a platform.\n\nOnly when the Indian attack got tired in the final hour did he open out. Maxwell stepped down the track delightfully to dismiss Jadeja over his head.\n\nHe also drove Ashwin through wide mid-off with balance and poise and rocked back to pull Jadeja over mid-wicket for the maximum.\n\nThe Indian bowling struggled as the day wore on. The bowling lacked the control and accuracy that could have created pressure on this surface.\n\nThe bowlers pitched on both sides of the wicket and were taken for runs. Without purchase from the pitch, Ashwin and Jadeja were lesser bowlers. There was hardly any bite for them off the pitch.\n\nBrilliant catch\n\nSave the occasion when Ashwin got a delivery to drift in and had the left-handed Shaun Marsh brilliantly held, bat-pad, by Cheteshwar Pujara at short-leg, the spinners could not quite beat the Australian batsmen in the air.\n\nIn fact, Umesh Yadav\u2019s pace and reverse swing represented the biggest threat for the Aussies.\n\nMean yorker\n\nUmesh did strike twice, forcing the well-set left-hander Matt Renshaw to nick one that moved away from him and winning a leg-before shout against Peter Handscomb with a mean yorker.\n\nIn the morning, David Warner, his mind under a siege in these conditions, discovered yet another way to get out, knocking a full toss back to Jadeja.\n\nRenshaw (44) looked good for more. He is calm at the crease, gets behind the line, and is comfortable off either foot.\n\nIndia was on the offensive after lunch but ran into a roadblock in the form of Smith and Maxwell.", 
        "body2": "Australia captain Steve Smith continued to lead from the front, as he did in the previous two sessions of the day to help his team reach a comfortable 299/4 at stumps on the opening day of the third Test at the JSCA International Stadium here on Thursday.\n\nWhen Smith on-drove part-time off-spinner Murali Vijay for a four to reach his 19th Test century in 53 games, he posted his second three-figure mark of the series and has already won a personal battle with his rival captain Virat Kohli in terms of the runs scored this series.\n\nBut keeping aside personal landmarks, Smith ensured that Australia finished the day on a high and in the company of Glenn Maxwell, who was playing only his fourth Test and first since November 2014, played an equally responsible knock as the two shared unbroken 159 for the fifth wicket on a good batting pitch \u2013 the highest partnership of the series so far.\n\nIn an entire session when Kohli was off the field following a shoulder injury sustained while diving and stopping the ball from reaching the boundary in the second session and was taking ice-pack treatment, his deputy Ajinkya Rahane made frequent bowling changes. But with no rewards.\n\nThe Smith-Maxwell duo also saw the highest team total reached in this Border-Gavaskar Trophy rubber after none of the previous two Tests saw any team score in excess of 290. Pace or spin made no difference to Smith and Maxwell who did not let go loose deliveries unpunished.\n\nSmith resumed post tea at 80 and did not show any urgency to reach his century. He took 66 deliveries to score 23 runs and reach the coveted milestone. Maxwell was the more attacking player, even though by his standards, he had curbed his attacking instincts. So much so that his first boundary came after facing 56 deliveries.\n\nBut once he tasted his first boundary, he did not keep quiet. Twice he slammed Jadeja for sixes \u2013 one over mid-wicket and another straight \u2013 but at other times, he milked the Indian bowling along with his captain to not give any chance to the hosts.\n\nSmith was all serious, focussing on the task at hand \u2013 of taking his team to a strong position. So much so that at one stage, when on 97, there was a funny moment with the ball dislodging between his legs off Jadeja and wicketkeeper Wriddhiman Saha was bent upon taking the ball before it fell on to the ground. Even the umpire Ian Gould burst into laughter but no way the appeal for caught could be given as the ball becomes dead when it \u201cwhether played or not it lodges in the clothing or equipment of a batsman or the clothing of an umpire\u201d.\n\nThe incident did not amuse Smith at all, showing how much focussed he was at the job on hand.\n\nBrief scores: At stumps: Australia 299/4 in 90 overs (S Smith 117*, G Maxwell 82*)"

        "body1": "Josh Frydenberg on plan to expand Snowy Hydro scheme\n\nAustralian Broadcasting Corporation Broadcast: 16/03/2017 Reporter: Leigh Sales\n\nFederal Energy Minister Josh Frydenberg joins 7.30 to discuss the new plan for the Snowy Hydro scheme and that stoush with SA Premier Jay Weatherill.\n\nTranscript\n\nLEIGH SALES, PRESENTER: Australia's Energy Minister, Josh Frydenberg, joined me a short time ago from Melbourne.Minister, thanks for coming in.JOSH FRYDENBERG, MINISTER FOR ENERGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT: Nice to be with you, Leigh.LEIGH SALES: Today was an announcement of a nine-month feasibility study into the possibility of an expansion of the Snowy Hydro Scheme, that may take upwards of four years to complete if it gets the necessary approvals.This is about as concrete as a wisp of smoke, isn't it?JOSH FRYDENBERG: Oh, no. This is a very significant announcement by the Prime Minister and it has the potential to provide a huge increase in renewable energy for the states of New South Wales, Victoria; indeed, for South Australia.It's a nation-bidding scheme, potentially adding 2,000 megawatts to the 4,000 megawatts we already get from the Snowy Hydro Scheme. It would involve around $2 billion worth of expenditure.It would take a few years to build, but it would employ hundreds of people and really add to what is an iconic structure for Australia.LEIGH SALES: And you've not addressed my point: that there are many hurdles to be overcome before any of that was even close to a reality?JOSH FRYDENBERG: Well, Snowy Hydro itself has been working on this for some time. And we do know that the pumped hydro facilities and technology is proven. Indeed, 97 per cent of the world's storage in renewables around the world comes from pumped hydro.Now, we only have three of these facilities here in Australia. We have one at Wivenhoe Dam; we have one in Shoalhaven, south of Sydney; and we have one in the Snowy Hydro itself, at Tumut. But this will really add to our capacity to store power and to create renewable power.LEIGH SALES: The Snowy Hydro Power Scheme is jointly owned by the Federal, NSW and Victorian governments. When did the states find out about this plan of yours?JOSH FRYDENBERG: Well, yesterday the Prime Minister rang the Premier of NSW and I rang the Treasurer of Victoria. Both indicated that this was a positive announcement.And of course it's at the feasibility stage, but it's hoped that that can be completed before the end of the year and that this project can go ahead.LEIGH SALES: And for such...JOSH FRYDENBERG: Certainly the Prime Minister is very committed to it.LEIGH SALES: And for such a project that you have described as significant - $2 billion and all the rest of it - you consulted them yesterday for something being announced today?JOSH FRYDENBERG: Well, the Prime Minister had a very positive conversation. I had a very positive conversation. And this work had been undertaken by Snowy Hydro itself for some time.LEIGH SALES: And how much will the state governments be required to contribute financially?JOSH FRYDENBERG: Well, look, all of that is to be worked out once the final costing processes are carried through. But as the Prime Minister indicated today, he is very intent to ensure that the Commonwealth makes a significant contribution. And if the states don't want to make that contribution, then we may be prepared to step in there. The other point here...LEIGH SALES: And pay for the whole lot?JOSH FRYDENBERG: Well, let's just wait and see.LEIGH SALES: Well, now you have said that, why would the states pay for anything?JOSH FRYDENBERG: Well, it would dilute their shareholding, Leigh. That would be the key point.LEIGH SALES: And why would you make such a pledge when you said yourself that the final costing process is unknown? You have just committed to an unknown dollar figure there?JOSH FRYDENBERG (laughs): Leigh, good try. Look, this is an extremely important project. It is one that we need to go through this preliminary stage with the feasibility study.But the Prime Minister has made it very clear that he is committed to it; that the Snowy Hydro Corporation itself, Leigh, is very profitable and it could also put its own funds in.So we would hope that all the parties would contribute to the building of such a nationally important development. But if they don't step in, then obviously the Commonwealth will look seriously at what it could do.LEIGH SALES: So the Commonwealth is going to spend $2 billion or more. Where is that money going to come from?JOSH FRYDENBERG (chuckles): Leigh, we are right now celebrating the fact that a feasibility study will be under way and that next year...LEIGH SALES: And where is the money going to come from?JOSH FRYDENBERG: Well, obviously, projects like this make money because you are producing electricity that is needed.LEIGH SALES: And they have start-up costs and where are they going to come from?JOSH FRYDENBERG: But Leigh, the critical point here is that Australia needs this base-load generation. We're seeing the closure of Hazelwood, which is some 1,600 megawatts.This project has the potential to add some 2,000 megawatts of power to the grid. Importantly, as base-load power, it produces what are called the frequency control and ancillary services that are needed to stabilise the system.The challenges we have seen in South Australia and elsewhere, as a result of the high penetration of more wind and solar, need to be balanced out and obviously you can do that with thermal generation like coal and gas, but you can also do it with hydropower. So that is a very important aspect of this proposal.LEIGH SALES: The timeframe for the completion of this job, which we don't know yet, as we have established how much it will cost, what the states will pay and all the rest of it: the best-case scenario is around five years: a year for the feasibility study and then at least four years of work - best-case scenario. Yet Australia has an immediate energy crisis. How is that announcement today helping this?JOSH FRYDENBERG: Well, yesterday the Prime Minister had a very successful meeting with the LNG exporters and he achieved from them a commitment that they would meet any shortfalls in the domestic market for gas which is used to generate electricity.Now, we had been told by the Australian Energy Market Operator at the end of last week that there would be shortfalls from as early as 2018-19. So that's an immediate improvement to the stability of our system. And of course...LEIGH SALES: And does that - sorry to interrupt, but does that mean that deal you have just cited, that this coming summer we won't see blackouts?JOSH FRYDENBERG: Well, obviously, in South Australia they have got their additional challenges and the Premier there has announced some initiatives to try to meet that. And we stand ready to help improve the stability in South Australia. And today I was in that state, making a very significant announcement about battery storage that the Commonwealth is helping to fund. So we're doing...LEIGH SALES: I'll come to South Australia in a sec. Just on the eastern states, though: can you guarantee that this summer you're going to be taking enough steps to ensure that residents won't be hit by blackouts?JOSH FRYDENBERG: Well, we're constantly in contact with the Australian Energy Market Operator. They have already taken a number of steps to ensure the stability of the system. And we are continuing to engage with them and other parties to ensure that we have sufficient base-load power to stabilise the system.LEIGH SALES: Just on your row today with the South Australian Premier, Jay Weatherill: he does have a point, doesn't he? Your Government has taken many opportunities to give the South Australian Government a kick, rather than try to work with them?JOSH FRYDENBERG: Well, we're interested in serious solutions, not silly stunts. And what we saw from the Premier today, unfortunately, was the hijacking of an important announcement about the Commonwealth's contribution to battery storage in order for him to score some cheap political points.LEIGH SALES: And you didn't score any cheap political points yourself?JOSH FRYDENBERG: No. Well, we have been making the point all along that South Australia has got itself into trouble by having more than 40 per cent of its power coming from wind and solar. And they have done that without the necessary planning.LEIGH SALES: Do you regret that episode today?JOSH FRYDENBERG: Look, I was there to make an important announcement. The Commonwealth and AGL were the two partners who had put money into this project.LEIGH SALES: And do you regret that it was overshadowed by a spat between yourself and the State Premier?JOSH FRYDENBERG: I am very disappointed with the behaviour of the Premier today, because I don't think it was appropriate when we were making a positive announcement about the battery...LEIGH SALES: And you don't share any of the blame of it yourself?JOSH FRYDENBERG (laughs): Well, I certainly was talking very positively about the opportunities for cooperation between the Commonwealth and the State and my good working relationship with the Energy Minister in South Australia. But Jay Weatherill came with other motives and you can see how they played out.LEIGH SALES: Minister, we are out of time. Thanks very much for joining us this evening.JOSH FRYDENBERG: Good to be with you.",

Mr Butler called the plan \"a feasibility study on an unfunded project that at best won't deliver storage capacity for the best part of a decade\".\n\nMr Kelly said it was ironic that ARENA - which the Coalition had attempted to abolish - would now lead the project study, but welcomed the proposal.\n\n\"I personally have been advocating for 10 years that we can make Eden-Monaro a flagship for renewables in Australia.

The question is whether nuclear power is economic.\"\n\nLabor frontbencher Joel Fitzgibbon said the idea of investing in nuclear power \"is not without merit, but we are happily a nation with an abundance of fossil fuels and renewable resources, its high cost and we simply don't need to turn to nuclear\".\n\nFollow us on Facebook\n\nThe story Turnbull to increase Snowy Hydro stake if states will not fund expansion first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald."

Mixon is meeting with NFL teams in part to try to convince executives why they should take a chance on him.\n\nIn July 2014, as a freshman at Oklahoma, Mixon forcefully punched a young woman in the face at a sandwich shop. Mixon and the woman were in the midst of a verbal confrontation in Norman, Okla. The punch broke the woman\u2019s jaw and cheekbone.\n\nMixon was suspended for his freshman season and accepted a plea deal on an assault charge that kept him out of prison. It wasn\u2019t until December 2016, when the video of the incident was released, that the incident drew national attention.\n\nIt was a horrific reminder of the video of former Ravens running back Ray Rice punching his wife in an elevator. That video essentially ended Rice\u2019s NFL career. Mixon was also suspended for a game this past fall after reportedly tearing up a parking ticket and throwing it in an attendant\u2019s face.\n\nHis off-field behavior has led to most teams dropping his draft stock. As one of the most talented running backs in the draft, Mixon could go as early as the second round or somewhere during Day 3 depending on how well he does in the interview process leading up to the draft and what team will take a chance on him.\n\nMixon met with the Bengals last week, as well as several other teams at his Pro Day March 8. He wasn\u2019t invited to the NFL combine due to the assault, a decision that upset many NFL executives. Mixon has a number of other private visits scheduled.\n\nMixon, 6-foot-1, 228 pounds, had 2,921 rushing and receiving yards and 26 touchdowns in his two seasons at Oklahoma. He also was a successful kick and punt returner. He ran an unofficial 4.43 40-yard dash and impressed during on-field drills at his pro day.

Joseph and his coordinators all repeatedly emphasized that they understood how high the expectations are for the new staff, and they\u2019re only concerned with one thing: winning.\n\n\u201cWinning makes it so much more fun, easier to engage and obviously to entertain clients,\" Salem said, \"but also [it's important] to do it in the right way. The Broncos are a first-rate organization, very high-class organization, so it\u2019s always great to partner up with somebody who are not only winners but also do things the right way.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Broncos are the Broncos,\" Carlson added. \"The same objective, the same goals, the same mindset, the same culture and the same infrastructure is here.\u201d", 
        "body2": "The glamour signings have been John Elway\u2019s modus operandi in the past. Peyton Manning, DeMarcus Ware, Emmanuel Sanders, and Aqib Talib were all big names that came to Denver to find success. However, this year\u2019s free agency has elicited some complaints from Broncos Country.\n\nAs Ian St. Clair and I discussed on the Mile High Report Radio podcast, the approach may be different, but the results will likely be the same. There is really no way to evaluate the free agency signings until they play. That doesn\u2019t stop fans and analysts from making their feelings known.\n\nSo far, Elway has signed some big players. Maybe not in name, but certainly in size, and these signings signal something very important. Elway knows what needs to be done to get the Broncos back to contending for a Super Bowl.\n\nWelcome to the Mile High city big men. The Broncos are now entrenched pic.twitter.com/W5R9FyIjgA \u2014 Denver Broncos 365 (@DailyBroncos) March 12, 2017\n\nEverything is predicated on the running game. Stopping the run was the most significant omission from the Broncos defense. Bring in Domata Peko and Zack Kerr to plug the middle of the line. Success running the ball was lacking. Change the scheme and bring in Ronald Leary and Menelik Watson.\n\nThese moves, along with the changes to the coaching staff should serve to make huge improvements, especially on the offensive side of the ball. Jeff Davidson is a huge upgrade at OL coach. The Broncos have players on the roster, along with the free agent signings, that will benefit from this change. Connor McGovern and Ty Sambrailo (don\u2019t laugh) will improve because of this change.\n\nSimplifying the system will help the young players who went undeveloped under the last coaching regime. The offense has an opportunity to change, and improve. The defense has big bodies to plug up a leaky line, which will free up linebackers like Brandon Marshall to make big plays.\n\nThese are not sexy signings. They make fans scratch their heads, wondering why Elway isn\u2019t landing big name free agents like Calais Campbell. The answer is simple. Tony Romo. The only other gaping hole that needs to be filled? Quarterback. Like it or not, the best option at quarterback right now is Romo.\n\nElway knows that taking up too much cap space will make bringing Romo to Denver much more difficult. Whether the Broncos future is Paxton Lynch or Trevor Siemian, winning right now means 2017 should belong to Romo. Every move Elway makes will be geared toward creating space to sign the former Cowboys starter.\n\nFrom this seat, the Broncos 2017 season is looking promising. Tony Romo makes that future look even brighter. Elway has done what is necessary to make that possible."

        "body1": "The election of Sally McManus to the position of Australian Council of Trade Unions secretary is not good news for the Coalition and Malcolm Turnbull.\n\nJust as unions have been given the perfect fodder to run an anti-Work Choices style campaign \u2013 in the form of a dramatic Sunday penalty rate cut in retail and hospitality awards by the Fair Work Commission \u2013 the ACTU is elevating its campaign director to the top job.\n\nMcManus, 45, will be elected unopposed at an ACTU executive meeting on Wednesday, the first female secretary of the peak body and one half of an all-female leadership team with the current president, Ged Kearney.\n\nJust as it gathers steam on coal, the Coalition is derailed by penalty rates | Katharine Murphy Read more\n\nHer predecessor, Dave Oliver, built a $13m war chest for the Build a Better Future campaign around the 2016 federal election, which McManus used to boost Labor\u2019s highly contested claim that the Turnbull government would \u201cprivatise Medicare\u201d.\n\nTim Ayres, the Australian Manufacturing Workers\u2019 Union\u2019s New South Wales secretary and leftwing powerbroker, describes his friend and ally as \u201crelentless and ruthless\u201d and says the ACTU \u201cwill pack a campaign punch\u201d under her leadership.\n\n\u201cShe is absolutely committed to making unions effective campaigning voices, not just in the election cycle but using every organising issue to mobilise Australian workers.\u201d\n\nMcManus tells Guardian Australia the key to strong campaigns is that they are driven by the members upwards. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to bring everything you can to a fight: not just legally, not just politically, not just in workplaces, but everywhere. You approach it at every level and bring every bit of capacity ... that\u2019s the way I will approach campaigns as ACTU secretary.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe union movement is in the fight of its life. Membership figures hit an all-time low in 2015, with just 14.4% of workers belonging to a union.\n\nWe\u2019ve got to inspire a whole generation who are sick of so much wealth at the top Sally McManus\n\nMcManus says that effective campaigns can turn that around, pointing to a rise in membership during her time as the Australian Services Union\u2019s New South Wales secretary from 10,000 to 12,000.\n\n\u201cThe reason union membership has declined is due to the destruction of regular work, it\u2019s in decline all around the world. Steady, secure jobs are being contracted out, outsourced, people are put on rolling contracts or forced to get ABN \u2013 all things that have taken power away from workers and made it much harder to organise.\u201d\n\nMcManus, from the left faction, calls for stronger laws to stop casualisation of the workforce \u2013 specifically laws that give workers more power in the workplace.\n\nCurrently the Fair Work Act only allows collective bargaining in individual workplaces, forcing unions to negotiate one agreement at a time across many enterprises.\n\n\u201cWorkers should be able to bargain collectively however they want to: across an industry, supply chain, or according to their occupation,\u201d she says.\n\nIt\u2019s an ambitious platform and it goes further than Labor\u2019s current workplace relations policy. McManus says she won\u2019t simply be negotiating behind closed doors for the changes but rather will build public pressure to force the parties to respond.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not aiming to fix the problem at one election but for a whole generation, and that\u2019s not an easy task.\u201d\n\nWhen he ran unsuccessfully for the top job in 2015, former ACTU assistant secretary Tim Lyons warned the body was too focused on political campaigns at the expense of organising in workplaces. Elections measure the temperature of a society but the union movement needed to be like a thermostat that permanently changes it, Lyons wrote after Oliver defeated his challenge.\n\nMcManus\u2019s vision responds to that critique by encompassing both goals: to win industrial power back in part through changing laws and to use campaigns to hold gains by changing opinions permanently.\n\nMcManus\u2019s friend and former ASU assistant secretary in NSW Michael Flinn agrees that she builds \u201cstrong community connections\u201d through campaigns \u201cthat don\u2019t just rely on political wheeling and dealing, they come from the grassroots up\u201d.\n\nIt is that approach that leads Ayres to credit McManus with running what he calls the greatest union campaign of the decade, the ASU\u2019s equal pay campaign. Over five years McManus built a coalition to put equal pay provisions in the Fair Work Act and launched a test case that resulted in 150,000 community service workers winning pay rises of between 20 and 50%.\n\n\u201cIt was more than a legislative win, the campaign built the case for change,\u201d Ayres says. \u201cEvery politician wanted to be the first in the line to sign the ASU campaign pledge. That sort of momentum, whether in bargaining, or legislative processes or the [Fair Work] Commission is inescapable. Sally built the clear moral case for change.\u201d\n\nAnother booster is Ros McLennan, the Queensland Council of Unions general secretary, who first met McManus three years ago while discussing a pilot penalty rates campaign in Townsville.\n\nMcLennan says she was was affectionately known as Field Marshall McManus during the 2016 federal election campaign. The pair drove between coastal towns in regional Queensland to meet delegates and build a campaign infrastructure.\n\n\u201c[McManus] wanted to get a feel for the country, to talk to people every minute of the day as we did things like get a bottle of water or fill the car up with petrol, to truly connect with workers in the area,\u201d McLennan said.\n\n\u201c[McManus] is a really inclusive person ... She is one of the few I\u2019ve ever met that treats union members the same as delegates, the same as organisers, the same as a national secretary. She\u2019s a normal person, she doesn\u2019t think she\u2019s too good for others or have her head in clouds.\u201d\n\nMcManus attended Carlingford high school in northwest Sydney then did a bachelor of arts majoring in philosophy at Macquarie University. She entered the union movement in the mid-1990s as a trainee in the organising works program and a youth representative on the ACTU executive. She served for a decade as the Australian Services Union\u2019s NSW branch secretary from 2005 to 2015, when she moved to the ACTU campaign director role.\n\nWayne McManus, her younger brother, agrees that it is her ability to relate to people that makes her the best pick for the ACTU top job. \u201cEveryone is equal to Sally, no matter what their race or sexuality or anything else, she treats everyone with respect,\u201d he said.\n\nThat respect extends to the women McManus says were trailblazers leading the union movement before her, including the first female ACTU president, Jennie George, her successor, Sharan Burrow, and Kearney, and the many women who are rank and file leaders.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very proud to be the first female secretary of the ACTU ... But it\u2019s not like I\u2019m the first to ever hold a leadership position. At the moment 52% of union members are women, so it\u2019s not surprising. I think people haven\u2019t supported me because I\u2019m a woman but because I\u2019ll do a good job as secretary and be a leader for everyone.\u201d\n\nMcManus has enormous goodwill from those she will lead. McLennan says: \u201cSally is a feminist, an activist, an organiser, a campaigner and a rockstar. All power to her arm.\u201d\n\nThe first fight will be penalty rates and McManus notes that when parliament resumes next week politicians will have a chance to vote on a bill to reverse the Fair Work Commission cut.\n\n\u201cWe will keep everyone accountable for their decision and keep campaigning until they do change the law [to protect penalty rates],\u201d she says.\n\nMcManus praises small businesses who have vowed not to pass the cuts on and warns that \u201cworkers are consumers\u201d, suggesting that workers could mobilise to avoid businesses that do pass them on. Her ACTU campaign team coordinated a boycott at Carlton United Breweries when the Electrical Trades Union and Australian Manufacturing Workers Union were locked in a dispute about outsourcing their jobs for less pay.\n\nAfter months of pickets and workers and their allies eschewing the wrong brands, the unions claimed victory.\n\nPenalty rate cut: unions have golden opportunity to flex their muscles Read more\n\nHer causes are as broad as the tactics she uses to win. McManus rattles off multinational tax avoidance and environmental destruction as key concerns of workers and young people.\n\nMcLennan recalls McManus\u2019s support for Let Them Stay protests to stop baby Asha being deported to the Nauru detention centre, providing advice to Queensland unions and mobilising social media to help them sustain a 10 day vigil.\n\nAbove all, McManus promises to \u201ctake on corporate greed\u201d, noting that the workplace relations system in general and unions in particular have been a key driver of wealth redistribution.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t put limits on greed it just gets out of control. Things have gone too far and so we\u2019re demanding power back for ordinary people.\u201d\n\nMcManus says people understand that some have disproportionate power but \u201cthey throw their hands up, think it\u2019s inevitable and can\u2019t see how to change it\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to inspire a whole generation who are sick of so much wealth at the top. The system is at breaking point, people don\u2019t accept that it\u2019s right and fair. I want to change all of that and build a movement that everyone who feels the same can join.\u201d",
