Knocked back a request for a release from Mitch Moses. Tigers withdrew his offer due to salary cap @9NewsSyd \u2014 Danny Weidler (@Danny_Weidler) April 5, 2017\n\nThe @WestsTigers say that they may re-visit the offer to Mitch Moses - but Tedesco and Woods are the priorities. @9NewsSyd \u2014 Danny Weidler (@Danny_Weidler) April 5, 2017\n\nThe move came hours after NRL legend Phil Gould dropped a bombshell of his own on the Moses issue.\n\nGould said he suspects the manager of Moses and longtime friend Luke Brooks secretly wants to break the rising stars apart.\n\nThe day after Brooks re-signed with the club on a two-year deal, Gould, the Penrith Panthers\u2019 supremo, declared star player agent Isaac Moses secretly believes Brooks and Mitchell Moses may need to be separated in order for them to reach their potential.\n\nBrooks and Moses have been playing with each other since high school, where they both attended Holy Cross College in Ryde (northern Sydney).\n\nGould told his podcast, Six Tackles with Gus, on Wednesday there is a very real consideration that the pair are not actually suited to play alongside each other at NRL level.\n\nGould said Tigers coach Ivan Cleary has a tough decision to make about whether Mitchell Moses stays at the club following Brooks\u2019 decision to remain at the joint-venture.\n\n\u201cHe came into first grade with a boom on him and he probably hasn\u2019t lived up to expectations,\u201d Gould said of Brooks.\n\n\u201cI think that club suits him at the moment and I think the coach suits him as well so that\u2019s a good decision by Luke to remain with the club.\n\n\u201cWhether that means the other three players sign with the club it remains to be seen.\n\n\u201cI have a suspicion that Luke Brooks and Mitchell Moses probably wanted to both sell themselves as halfbacks and that the combination, even though they\u2019ve been together for a while and they have known each other for a while, probably doesn\u2019t gel on the field the way that they would like and there\u2019s been a thought from the management of both those players that maybe they need to split them up to get the best out of them and that their careers have to go separate ways.\n\n\u201cThat will be interesting. That will be one for Ivan Cleary to negotiate now. Whether or not he can convince them that they need to be together in the long term.\u201d\n\nIt comes as Gould also chastised the Tigers over a report indicating the club has tabled an offer to star fullback James Tedesco worth $4.4 million over four years, labelling the offer irresponsible.\n\nHe said there is currently not one player in the game that deserves to be taking up more than $1 million per season on an NRL club salary cap.\n\nHe said Johnathan Thurston was worth that figure four years ago when he famously tabled the Cowboys star a $4.8 million, four-year deal to join Penrith.\n\nHowever, at the age of 33, he believes even Thurston is not worth that figure.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really getting frustrated by the money getting reported around for these clubs and even the asking price for players these days,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see a $1 million footballer in the competition at the moment. I think it\u2019s ridiculous that any individual should be earning $1 million in a fixed salary cap.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m quite happy for them to earn it corporately, if they can find third party sponsors or business interest. But if you\u2019re managing a salary can properly, given the salary cap offers that we\u2019ve had from the NRL going forward, I can\u2019t see a $1 million player in the game if you\u2019re going to take it out of the salary cap.\n\n\u201cUnless it\u2019s supported through corporate dollars, if you\u2019re paying a player $1 million it has a big effect on everything you\u2019re doing in your club.\n\n\u2014 with The Daily Telegraph\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s not one player in the competition who I would pay $1 million to at the moment at all. Not even close top it, under the fixed salary cap model we have going forward.\u201d\n\nHe said a key criteria for a player being worth $1 million per season is that they are leading their side to a winning percentage of at least 60 per cent.\n\nHe warned the Tigers that the so-called \u201cbig four\u201d have not been winning games of football this season and doesn\u2019t believe that will change in the future, just because they are all earning more money.\n\n\u201cIs James Tedesco a 60 per cent winning player for the Tigers? No,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve got all those four players together now and they\u2019re not winning games. Paying them more money doesn\u2019t make them better players and it\u2019s not going to improve their strike rate.\n\n\u201cThe more money you pay them, the less talent you can put around them.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile,\n\nGould believes Cooper Cronk will retire at the end of this season rather than play on for a Sydney-based club in 2018.\n\nHe said he expects Cronk, turning 34 this year, will look back at the end of this season with the Storm and be satisfied with his career, rather than feel the need to build something from scratch in Sydney.",

        "summary": "Register now\u00a9 Thomson Reuters 2017\n\nThe big data company credited with helping Donald Trump win the US presidency has registered a company in Australia and plans to meet the country's ruling conservative Liberal Party next week, according to documents and a government official.Cambridge Analytica, which has also said its 'psychographic' methods helped the successful campaign for Britain to leave the European Union, has registered an Australian office at a property currently being redeveloped in the Sydney beachfront suburb of Maroubra, corporate filings show.The presence of Cambridge Analytica in Australia underscores its efforts to capitalise on two high profile successes in the past year and enlarge its footprint in established Western democracies.The person named in filings as the only shareholder of Cambridge Analytica's Australian operation, Allan Lorraine, confirmed in a telephone call he was working with the firm but declined to comment further.Cambridge Analytica's US head office declined an interview request with the company's global chief executive officer, Alexander Nix, to discuss its Australian plans.Nix is scheduled to speak at an Australian data analytics conference next week and will be meeting officials from Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull's Liberal Party.\n\"It is scary how accurate the information is you can glean from publicly available data,\" said Bela Stantic, an information technology professor who runs the Big Data and Smart Analytics laboratory at Griffith University in Australia.Still, Australian election analysts questioned whether Cambridge Analytica's model, which involves analysing people's voting and party registration history, as well as social media profiles and other data, would work in Australia.Most Australians do not register for political parties and voting histories are not recorded, while the country's compulsory voting system also weakens the power of campaigns aimed at encouraging - or discouraging - certain demographic groups to vote.\n\"Senior Liberals will be talking to Mr Nix and the Cambridge Analytica team while they're out here in Australia, and will be interested to talk with them about their capacities and what they're offering people in the Australian political system,\" said Tony Nutt, party's federal director.The main opposition Labor Party declined to comment.Cambridge Analytica says it uses 'behavioural microtargeting', or combining analysis of people's personalities with demographics, to predict and influence mass behaviour.\nIt has federal elections every three years, among the shortest election cycles of developed nations, and is one of the only countries with compulsory voting enforced by fines at federal, state and local government level.The Australian arm of Cambridge Analytica has so far lodged no financial disclosures, according to regulatory records, suggesting it has not traded in the country despite being established before the federal election in 2016 and several state elections.While profiling would-be voters and targeting messaging is nothing new, Cambridge Analytica achieved a degree of notoriety after media reports revealed the extent of its data gathering and apparent effectiveness.\n\"They might find it useful but still most political professionals in this country would be of the view that campaigns are not about motivating people to vote, it's about banging the same message long enough that those who aren't interested hear it,\" said Antony Green, election analyst at the Australian Broadcasting Corp.Alex Oliver, director of the polling program at non-partisan think tank the Lowy Institute, said Australian law required organisations to disclose the source of political advertising.\nAccording to Reuters, Cambridge Analytica has registered an office in Maroubra, Sydney, and Liberal Party director Tony Nutt says the party plans to meet company representatives this week.\nAustralia's premier electoral analyst Antony Green told Reuters tools like Cambridge Analytica might be \u201cuseful\u201d to parties, but unlike America, Australian campaigns \u201care not about motivating people to vote, it's about banging the same message long enough that those who aren't interested hear it\u201d.\nIt says it has data on 220 million Americans, two thirds of the population.Its London-based parent company, consumer researcher SCL Group Ltd, says it formed Cambridge Analytica in 2013 to work on the US election.\n", 
        "body1": "The company has repeatedly claimed it helped Donald Trump win the US presidency and got the Brexiters' \"Leave\" cause over the line has arrived in Australia.\n\nAccording to Reuters, Cambridge Analytica has registered an office in Maroubra, Sydney, and Liberal Party director Tony Nutt says the party plans to meet company representatives this week.\n\n(Reuters mis-identifies Nutt as a \u201cgovernment official\u201d, which he's not.)\n\nCambridge Analytica's Matthew Oczkowski was listed to speak at the Australian Direct Marketing Association's https://www.adma.com.au/people/alexander-nix \u201cData Day\u201d presentations (at the Four Seasons Hotel in Sydney today; Sofitel Melbourne on Collins on Wednesday), but if Reuters is correct, he'll be either joined or replaced by CEO Alexander Nix, ahead of their meeting with the Liberal Party.\n\nThe company claims to have swung votes using a technique called \u201cbehavioural microtargeting\u201d: profiling people using public information like Facebook \u201clikes\u201d.\n\nAs The Register noted in March, there's some expert scepticism to deal with. First, marketers have grouped people by psychological traits for decades; and second, anybody who's wondered why Toyota thinks their five-figure salary will let them buy a Lexus knows how sloppy individual targeting can be.\n\nThe Little Atoms blog in January turned up other flaws in the \u201cbig data won it for Trump/Brexit\u201d trope \u2013 after all, the Republicans aren't the only ones trying to turn \u201cbig data\u201d into electoral success.\n\nEver since Barack Obama's 2008 election win, publications have touted the Democrats' effective use of data. Yet the two data-jockeys from Obama's 2012 campaign told The Register that the most significant piece of data they collected was voters' answer to the question \"Do you support the President?\". The \"big data wins elections\" argument also sputters out a bit when one considers that the Democrats flubbed key states that turned for Trump in 2016.\n\nAustralia's premier electoral analyst Antony Green told Reuters tools like Cambridge Analytica might be \u201cuseful\u201d to parties, but unlike America, Australian campaigns \u201care not about motivating people to vote, it's about banging the same message long enough that those who aren't interested hear it\u201d.\n\nIn any case, the Liberal Party already has its big data platform \u2013 Parakeelia.\n\nNor will the Australian electoral system represent a ship coming in for Cambridge Analytica.

        "body2": "\u00a9 Thomson Reuters 2017\n\nThe big data company credited with helping Donald Trump win the US presidency has registered a company in Australia and plans to meet the country's ruling conservative Liberal Party next week, according to documents and a government official.Cambridge Analytica, which has also said its 'psychographic' methods helped the successful campaign for Britain to leave the European Union, has registered an Australian office at a property currently being redeveloped in the Sydney beachfront suburb of Maroubra, corporate filings show.The presence of Cambridge Analytica in Australia underscores its efforts to capitalise on two high profile successes in the past year and enlarge its footprint in established Western democracies.The person named in filings as the only shareholder of Cambridge Analytica's Australian operation, Allan Lorraine, confirmed in a telephone call he was working with the firm but declined to comment further.Cambridge Analytica's US head office declined an interview request with the company's global chief executive officer, Alexander Nix, to discuss its Australian plans.Nix is scheduled to speak at an Australian data analytics conference next week and will be meeting officials from Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull's Liberal Party.\"Senior Liberals will be talking to Mr Nix and the Cambridge Analytica team while they're out here in Australia, and will be interested to talk with them about their capacities and what they're offering people in the Australian political system,\" said Tony Nutt, party's federal director.The main opposition Labor Party declined to comment.Cambridge Analytica says it uses 'behavioural microtargeting', or combining analysis of people's personalities with demographics, to predict and influence mass behaviour. It says it has data on 220 million Americans, two thirds of the population.Its London-based parent company, consumer researcher SCL Group Ltd, says it formed Cambridge Analytica in 2013 to work on the US election. Cambridge Analytica worked for the campaign of failed Republican candidate Ted Cruz before signing on with Trump.Although it has a population of only 24 million, Australia offers high sales volumes for companies which make money from elections. It has federal elections every three years, among the shortest election cycles of developed nations, and is one of the only countries with compulsory voting enforced by fines at federal, state and local government level.The Australian arm of Cambridge Analytica has so far lodged no financial disclosures, according to regulatory records, suggesting it has not traded in the country despite being established before the federal election in 2016 and several state elections.While profiling would-be voters and targeting messaging is nothing new, Cambridge Analytica achieved a degree of notoriety after media reports revealed the extent of its data gathering and apparent effectiveness.\"It is scary how accurate the information is you can glean from publicly available data,\" said Bela Stantic, an information technology professor who runs the Big Data and Smart Analytics laboratory at Griffith University in Australia.Still, Australian election analysts questioned whether Cambridge Analytica's model, which involves analysing people's voting and party registration history, as well as social media profiles and other data, would work in Australia.Most Australians do not register for political parties and voting histories are not recorded, while the country's compulsory voting system also weakens the power of campaigns aimed at encouraging - or discouraging - certain demographic groups to vote.\"They might find it useful but still most political professionals in this country would be of the view that campaigns are not about motivating people to vote, it's about banging the same message long enough that those who aren't interested hear it,\" said Antony Green, election analyst at the Australian Broadcasting Corp.Alex Oliver, director of the polling program at non-partisan think tank the Lowy Institute, said Australian law required organisations to disclose the source of political advertising.\"I'd be concerned about the intentions and bona fides of a commercial organisation which claimed to have influenced important elections through audience targeting and psychological manipulation,\" Oliver said in an email.\"That practice, if indeed it could be achieved, would impinge on the proper functioning of a democratic system.\"(Editing by Lincoln Feast)",

Fails to win seat.\n\n2010 \u2014 Day runs as Family First senate candidate in SA, but fails to win seat.\n\n2013 \u2014 Day wins SA senate seat for Family First.\n\n2014 \u2014 Day tells Finance Department officials he doesn\u2019t want to use former senator Don Farrell\u2019s Adelaide CBD office. Instead he wants to use a Kent Town building. Finance officials tell then-Special Minister of State Michael Ronaldson that Day owns the building and intends to sell it on condition the office is leased to the commonwealth. After lengthy negotiation Day agrees to terms for lease.\n\n2015 \u2014 Lease signed between building\u2019s new owners and commonwealth. No rent paid.\n\nAugust 2016 \u2014 Day approaches new Special Minister of State Scott Ryan about rent on the office. Ryan seeks further information on the background of the lease and discovers there may be a constitutional breach.\n\nOctober 2016 \u2014 Ryan terminates lease and seeks independent legal advice from constitutional law expert David Jackson. Day announces he will resign as his Home Australia Group of companies goes into liquidation. Ryan receives legal advice regarding the possible invalid election of Day, with concerns over indirect pecuniary interest because building owner owes Day money. November 2016 \u2014 Day tenders his resignation to the Senate President. Senate refers the lease matter and Day\u2019s possible invalid run for parliament to the High Court.\n\nApril 5, 2017 \u2014 High Court finds Day was ineligible to run under section 44 of the constitution, which states a member or senator can be disqualified where there is \u201cany direct or indirect pecuniary interest in any agreement with the public service of the commonwealth\u201d.\n\nMORE TO COME\n\n\u2014 with AAP", 
        "body0": "Ruling means vacancy will be filled via recount of election\u2019s votes, which will likely return second Family First candidate\n\nBob Day was ineligible to be a senator because he had an \u201cindirect pecuniary interest\u201d in an agreement with the commonwealth, the high court unanimously ruled on Wednesday.\n\nThe ruling means that Day\u2019s vacancy, created when he resigned in November over the liquidation of his building companies, will be filled by a recount of last election\u2019s votes.\n\nThe process is very likely to return the second Family First candidate, Lucy Gichuhi, as the new senator for South Australia. The result has no impact on votes cast by Day during his time in the Senate, which are all still valid.\n\nBob Day sought arrangement to receive rent for electorate office, court hears Read more\n\nDay\u2019s eligibility was referred to the high court on 8 November to determine if he had an indirect interest in the lease of his Adelaide electorate office by the commonwealth, in breach of section 44 of the constitution.\n\nFullarton Investments, an entity that bought the 77 Fullarton Road property from the Day family trust on a vendor finance basis, was to receive rent from the commonwealth and use it to pay back the trust, although no rent was ever paid.\n\nA majority of the court found that Day was ineligible from 26 February 2016, the date on which Fullarton Investments directed the commonwealth to pay rent to a bank account owned by Day.\n\nJustices Geoffrey Nettle, Michelle Gordon and Stephen Gageler suggested the date of ineligibility should be 1 December 2015, the date the lease was executed.\n\nIn submissions to the court at the 7 February hearing the solicitor general, Stephen Donaghue, quoted a letter from Day\u2019s accountant, Vic Rasera, on 2 December 2013 that Day had sought advice about creating Fullarton Investments \u201cso as to be able to avail himself of the rental allowance provided by the government\u201d.\n\nIn late December 2015 Day asked the then special minister of state, Mathias Cormann, for almost $60,000 in back payments from 1 July that year because the commonwealth had failed to find a new tenant for his predecessor\u2019s office, which triggered the obligation to pay rent.\n\nCormann asked for evidence that Day had paid rent for his office, which led Day to reveal the arrangement to pay back the Day family trust to the finance department on 25 January 2016. \u201cNo rent, no vendor finance repayments,\u201d he wrote.\n\nThe commonwealth submitted this evidenced \u201ca reasonable expectation of monies arising out of the lease\u201d.\n\nThe justices unanimously held that Day stood to obtain a financial benefit from the commonwealth because the rent was to be paid directly into a bank account he owned, and that constituted an indirect pecuniary interest.\n\nChief Justice Susan Kiefel and justices Virginia Bell and James Edelman said it was \u201cnot difficult to infer\u201d that the reason Day nominated his bank account to receive rent was that he intended to use to money to repay the mortgage his family trust had taken out to buy the property.\n\nGageler held that Day also had an indirect interest because he was the guarantor of the loan and because he was a beneficiary of the family trust.\n\nHe said there was \u201cnothing remote or unlikely\u201d about the rent benefiting Day either through loan repayments or trust distributions by flowing through Fullarton Investments to the trustee of the family trust.\n\nThe annual rent due was $66,540 a year. Nettle and Gordon concluded Day\u2019s interest was a \u201cnot insubstantial financial gain or loss arising from the existence, performance or breach of the lease\u201d.\n\nThe pair said that Day\u2019s interest in the lease meant he \u201ccould conceivably have been influenced ... in the performance of his duties as a member of parliament\u201d because he could conceivably have preferred his private interest in rent being paid over his public duty.\n\nJustice Patrick Keane said if officers of the executive government had known of the interest, Day\u2019s discussions with them \u201ccould have appeared as a case of a cross-bench senator seeking private accommodation from an executive government which was in need of cross-bench support for its legislative program\u201d.\n\nThe majority of the court held there was no need for a pecuniary interest to be legally enforceable.\n\n\n\nThe conduct of the special count will be governed by orders from a single justice of the court, but the judges have already rejected a submission from the former Labor senator Anne McEwen that the Family First ticket should be collapsed owing to Day\u2019s ineligibility.\n\nSuch a move would in effect disenfranchise voters who voted for Family First, whose votes should count for Gichuhi below the line, they said.\n\nThe court ordered the commonwealth to pay Day and McEwen\u2019s costs, save for costs excluded by another order of the court.\n\n'What did you know and when?': Labor wants government answers on Bob Day fiasco Read more\n\nThe attorney general, George Brandis, and the special minister of state, Scott Ryan, said the court had delivered the result the government had asked for, and a new senator would be sworn in when the Senate met on 9 May after the recount.\n\nA constitutional law expert, Anne Twomey, said the decision had broadened the definition of \u201cindirect pecuniary interest\u201d to situations where members and senators \u201cseek to benefit their private interests above their public duty\u201d and provided that it does not require a legal or equitable interest in the agreement itself.\n\n\u201cThere is, however, no relevant interest if the agreement in question is one ordinarily made between the government and a citizen.\u201d\n\nThe plurality noted that a penalty applies to senators who sit while not eligible, but Twomey said in Day\u2019s case it would amount to just $200 because he did not sit while ineligible after the suit was brought against him.",

He was ineligible to sit as a senator for South Australia from February 26, 2016, the court found.\n\nMr Day's vacancy will be filled by a special recount of the Senate ballot papers, with Family First's second candidate Lucy Gichuhi expected to replace him.\n\nHowever Ms Gichuhi's own eligibility has been under a cloud because of speculation she was also a Kenyan citizen at the time of the last election.\n\nUnder the Australian constitution dual citizens are not permitted to stand for election and if they have been unable to renounce citizenship of another country must have taken \"reasonable steps\" to attempt to do so.\n\nAt a press conference on Wednesday, Ms Gichuhi repeatedly refused to comment on her citizenship status at the time of the last election but denied having ever been a dual citizen.\n\n\"I've never been a dual citizen,\" she said. \"I won't go to any details on that matter but I will say I am not a dual citizen.\"\n\nSouth Australian Family First leader Dennis Hood told Fairfax Media the party was \"absolutely satisfied\" with Ms Gichuhi's eligibility after its lawyers closely examined the matter.\n\nMs Gichuhi, who said she would be an \"independent-minded\" senator, is expected to be a less predictable supporter of the Turnbull government than Mr Day, an economically dry former Liberal Party candidate who usually sided with the Coalition.\n\nMr Day announced he would resign from the Senate last year to focus on his troubled construction company, which had gone into liquidation. But the process was sped up when concerns about his alleged pecuniary interest with the Commonwealth were raised.\n\nSpeaking after the decision was handed down, Ms Gichuhi told Fairfax Media she was \"very much\" excited about the prospect of becoming a senator.\n\nShe has previously spoken about attending school in rural Kenya where there was only one classroom and most lessons were conducted under a tree. She said she wants to inspire migrant communities to embrace Australian society and support family businesses.\n\nAfter moving to Australia, Ms Gichuhi worked at the SA Auditor-General's Department and was admitted as a lawyer in 2015.\n\nLabor had argued that all votes for Family First should be disregarded because Ms Gichuhi was the only other candidate on the party's ballot paper other than Mr Day.\n\nParties require at least two candidates to form a ticket, raising the possibility that an extra Labor senator could be elected.\n\nBut in their reasoning, the High Court justices found the argument that Family First's votes should be disregarded would \"constitute a most serious distortion of the real intention of many thousands of voters\" - particularly those who voted for the party above the line.\n\nAlthough it is true that the Electoral Act requires two or more eligible candidates, the justices found the ineligibility of Mr Day did not have the \"invalidating effect\" Labor had argued.\n\nMr Day told Fairfax Media: \"I'm naturally disappointed but I trust Family First will retain the seat on the recount.\"\n\nSpecial Minister of State Scott Ryan said: \"This is the outcome the government sought from the court.\n\n\"This decision confirms the government took the appropriate action last year by proactively asking the Senate to refer the matter to the High Court.\"\n\nSenator Ryan said the matter would return to the High Court in coming days for final directions and that a new senator would be sworn in on May 9.\n\nMr Day's High Court case centred on a property in Kent Town, South Australia, that Mr Day used as his electorate office.\n\nMr Day owned the building until 2014 when he transferred it to a friend and neighbour Colin Steiner.\n\n???But Mr Day continued to use the property as a loan facility, and rental payments for the property would have been directed to a bank account owned by Mr Day.\n\n\"It was unanimously held that the financial benefit which Mr Day stood to obtain from the Commonwealth performing its obligations to pay rent pursuant to the lease constituted an 'indirect pecuniary interest',\" Chief Justice Susan Keifel said.\n\n\"By virtue of the direction that the rent be paid into a bank account owned by him, Mr Day was to receive rent directly from the Commonwealth. Therefore he had an expectation of a pecuniary benefit from the lease.\"\n\nSouth Australian Family First leader Dennis Hood said: \"We believe that Bob Day acted with integrity in his dealings with the government but unfortunately the advice he received about his office facilities proved incorrect.\n\n\"Family First, like the other parties and individuals who stood for the Senate at the last election, will now await for the decision of the Electoral Commission after a single judge of the High Court gives directions as to the recount.\"\n\nFollow us on Facebook\n\nThe story Family First candidate in Senate box seat after Bob Day election ruled invalid first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.",

The advertising pros responsible here likely thought they were producing a modern version of Coca-Cola\u2019s famous \u201cHilltop\u201d ad \u2014 which Don Draper might have created \u2014 but they missed the mark by, oh, several million miles. Then again, the entire internet is sharing thoughts about the ad, so maybe it\u2019s a huge success.\n\nOr maybe, everyone\u2019s missing the bigger picture here.\n\nWow. Truly historic.

DEVOLVING turned in an encouraging debut at this venue when runner-up to odds-on favourite Sheikha who franked the form by placing in the Widden at Randwick on Saturday. The step to 1300m is ideal and we already know this filly can handle a heavy track. 4. LANKAN PHARAOH is trialling super, 1. BIDWEE is also a player.\n\nBETTING STRATEGY: DEVOLVING win\n\nRACE 2 (1.25pm)\n\n9. SWEET ADALINE opened her second campaign with a closing 2.8-lengths third to Wild Five in a strong maiden at Goulburn last start. That was a heavy 9, which gives her the tick in the conditions. She has always looked like she\u2019d win races in town and could be in for a good prep. Stablemate 6. SHAOLIN KUNGFU was never going to beat Whispered Secret at Newcastle first-up but did a creditable job to finish 2.3-lengths astern. Fitter for the outing and wants a mile-plus. 4. RAISE AN ARMY is in the mix.\n\nBETTING STRATEGY: SWEET ADALINE win, box trifecta 4, 6, 9\n\nRACE 3 (2.05pm)\n\n1. EGG TART has barely put a hoof wrong in her four starts. She was a dual acceptor today but it didn\u2019t take long after the fields were declared for Waller to scratch from the other race which is a decent lead in itself. She was really impressive winning that C1 at Beaumont on the heavy first-up, she can keep progressing through the grades. Local 7. KAWAIKINI has a very similar C.V to Egg Tart and has 3.5kgs less to carry which is a big plus in these conditions. Ran into a good horse last start and went super!\n\nBETTING STRATEGY: Quinella 1 & 7\n\nRACE 4 (2.40pm)\n\n3. DIVINE SANCTION looks the \u2018obvious\u2019 choice in this race after the scartching of Napoleon. He is at home over a suitable trip and he\u2019s handled soft, bred to go on heavy too. No excuses this time.\n\nBETTING STRATEGY: DIVINE SANCTION to win\n\nChautauqua makes history at the TJ Smith Stakes 1:15 Horse Racing: Chautauqua makes history at the TJ Smith Stakes. Chautauqua makes history at the TJ Smith Stakes\n\nRACE 5 (3.15pm)\n\n2. LYCIA is three starts, two wins at the track, 6s 2-1-1 at the distance, and best of all she is 2s 2w at the track/distance. On top of that she is very effective on slow and heavy and whilst she hasn\u2019t won in six fresh runs, she has been runner-up four times! Nice trial ahead of this. 1. MY PSYCHIATRIST was sent for a well-earned break after finishing fourth to stablemate Destiny\u2019s Kiss in the 2400m Xmas Cup. She has won from 1100m to 2000m so 1400m first-up is ideal.\n\nBETTING STRATEGY: LYCIA to win\n\nRACE 6 (3.50pm)\n\n3. HUNTER JACK has been a terrific horse for his owner/breeder Reg Kemister over the years winning more than $300,000. He is the proverbial model of consistency and Tim Martin has found a suitable race for the 7YO.\n\nBETTING STRATEGY: Box quinella 1, 3, 4\n\nRACE 7 (4.25pm)\n\n3. POUND STERLING is 4s 1-1-1 here at the Farm and was placed second beaten 0.2-lengths at his only prior at the track and distance. 1. MEDLYN was utterly dominant and impressive on debut here. Good race.\n\nBETTING STRATEGY: POUND STERLING to win\n\nRACE 8 (5.05pm)\n\n4. CONARCHIE is a real swimmer; the wetter the better for him. The Clarry Conners-trained chestnut won like Rough Habit here on a heavy 10 last campaign. He never missed a beat that preparation and he surely trialled well enough to indicate that he\u2019s done well over the break.\n\nBETTING STRATEGY: CONARCHIE each-way", 
        "body2": "NOTE: RACES are assessed for a Heavy 9. All horses are considered starters unless notified by Monday at 1 PM. (N/R) denotes no rating.\n\nRACE 1\n\n6. DEVOLVING (N/R) had trialled really well ahead of her debut in that maiden here on the heavy 9 on Mar 22. She was $11 out to $18 but that was mostly because of the backing for odds-on fav and winner Sheikha who came out and ran 3rd in the Kindergarten on Saturday so the form is deep. As for Devolving herself, her 1.3-lens 2nd on debut to an obviously handy type under almost exactly the same circumstances stands her in good stead for the win. 9. POPULAR (N/R) is a daughter of Commands out of a Rainbow Quest mare, 2nd dam is by Sadler\u2019s Wells, so if she runs to her breeding, she\u2019ll have no problems in wet ground. She has most certainly shown enough in her trials from time to time that she has talent and I suspect that with her pedigree (the dam is a half to Campanologist) that 1300m on debut is a good thing. 4. LANKAN PHAROAH (N/R) has some handy parents; All Too Hard and Chakvetdaze. Won two trials and beaten by his unbelievably exciting stablemate Our Crown Mistress in anything. Wait to you see her \u2014 the Mistress - race! Wow!\n\nRACE 2\n\nI HAVE Waller collecting the First 4 here, I must say I am less confident about the order however but one would suspect that he at least wins the race. I found it very hard to split 9. SWEET ADALINE (N/R) and 6. SHAOLIN KUNGFU (N/R). Both are second-up here off pretty decent runs in the lead-up. This is the first time Sweet Adaline sees the mile but she is by Lonhro and the way she got home at Goulburn on the heavy 9 in a better than average maiden would indicate she should actually relish it (the 1600m). We know already that Shaolin Kungfu can run the trip so that is something in his favour. He also comes through a strong maiden (Whispered Secret won the race) and he\u2019ll obviously strip fitter for the outing. If it comes to do anything I suppose it could be that Sweet Adaline proved herself on heavy, Shaolin hasn\u2019t been on worse than soft 6 yet. 10. VANZETTA (N/R) is progressive no doubt about that. Her second run was better than her debut which was pretty good in itself! Big player here up to the mile.\n\nmedia_camera Leading trainer Chris Waller has a strong hand throughout the Warwick Farm meeting.\n\nRACE 3\n\n1. EGG TART (71) was a dual acceptor, she runs here we know already. The Waller trained filly has a rock solid record in her short career of 4s 2-0-1 and the only unplaced run was a meritorious 4th on debut at the notoriously leader advantaged Beaumont track. Egg Tart has raced over the t/d once before and that was her 1.4-lens 3rd to Flow on Nov 23. Fast forward to more recent times and Egg Tart kicks off the new campaign with a 1.1-lens win at Beaumont on a heavy 8 so she proved that she is like most Sebrings and handles the slop. 7. KAWAIKINI (61) has a vaguely similar record to Egg Tart being 4s 2-1-1. Her neck 2nd to the very handy The Pinnacle at Newcastle last start was an almighty effort, Note too folks that she finished in front of 6. NAUGHTY THOUGHTS (64) who is going to have her share of admirers here as well. It\u2019s quite an interesting race really \u2014 I am not ruling out 8. SWEET CHESTNUT (61) but am not just sure about her in the wet \u2014 6s slow/heavy 0-0-0?\n\nRACE 4\n\nSO many times, in fact every time, there is a middle distance midweek race at WF I point out that anything goes, there are four legged lotteries. You see heaps of favs get rolled and lots of form reversals, that\u2019s just the way it goes \u2014 now throw in a heavy 9 and where to begin!? I hope this is one of those wide races because I am going way down to a horse than was beaten 14-lens last time in a C2 at the provincials. I speak of 11. NAPOLEON (66) who was off his game last start on Feb 21 but Jarrod Austin has given him a little freshen and a trial in between. The trial was very good. He is 3s 0-1-1 at the trip, he handles the wet and has no weight. 3. DIVINE SANCTION (72) should win this and he probably will but we\u2019ll be asked to take reasonably short odds about a horse who has sometimes been on the disappointing side of the ledger. To be honest, on paper, you can\u2019t really find a fault with him. I think whatever beats him will win \u2014 I could happily play the quinella 11 and 3. The Rod Northam trained 4. HE\u2019S DREAMIN\u2019 (69) has some very good numbers on wet ground and even better ones at the t/d namely 5s 0-2-2.\n\nRACE 5\n\n2. LYCIA (75) is 3s 2w at WF, 5s 2-2-1 soft, 2s 1-0-1 on heavy, 6s 2-1-1 at the trip, 6s 0-4-0 fresh. Let\u2019s save the best for last \u2014 she is 2s 2w at the t/d! One of those wins (Jan 7) came at the expense of Twist Tops and Roeinda. She has trialled exceedingly well coming into this and I suspect she might be being looked at for the Darley Crown at Hawkesbury in a few weeks time; it\u2019d be a nice goal for her. 7. BRIGADOON RISE (72) is 2s 1-1-0 here at WF. That 2nd came as recently as Mar 22 when the daughter of Stratum finished 2-lens 2nd in an 1100m Bm72. This is second time to 1400m, the only other time was when she ran 4th beaten 0.6-lens in the James HB Carr no less! 1. MY PSYCHIATRIST (78) is a classy mare. We all remember that amazing win at Rosehill on Dec 10, after that she was a creditable 4th to her stablemate Destiny\u2019s Kiss in the Xmas Cup then spelled. She has trialled rather well on two occasions for this race which being 1400m, is the Goldilocks trip for a mare who has won from 1100m to 2000m.\n\nRACE 6\n\nCHRIS Waller holds all the aces here but how many he plays only time will tell. That is, how many run? I hope and suspect 10. OCTAVIAN AUGUSTUS (66) is one of them that starts. He is a last start winner at Newcastle beating a reasonably handy horse in Denzil who was being hailed the winner before Octavian Augustus ran him down in the shadows of the post The two points to take out the win was that he had 61.5kgs and that he was very determined. That\u2019s a great sign because, for one reason or another, he\u2019s been a shade disappointing from time to time \u2014 whether it was a \u2018class thing\u2019 or ability or genuine-ness, who knows Bottom line, he won and won with plenty of merit so kudos to him. 3. HUNTER JACK (70) has won $300K, wow. That\u2019s what you get for consistency and this horse is most that. Another thing in his favour is that he was regularly mixed and matched it with better performed horses that what he meets on Wednesday. Speaking of consistency, 1. CLASSIC RECORDS (74) has been the proverbial model of such with a recent record of \u20182121\u2019. The son of the mighty High Chaparral (ex a Zabeel mare) is 3s 2-1-0 at the mile and was tough as old boots winning at Hawkesbury last start with the 61kgs. Harder here but comes down in weight.\n\nmedia_camera In Times Of War (centre) beats recent winner Zonk (left) at Warwick Farm. Picture Mark Evans.\n\nRACE 7\n\nCONSIDER this race to be the unofficial feature. I had it down to two and they are both Waller\u2019s (again) namely 7. IN TIMES OF WAR (67) and 3. POUND STERLING (65). I\u2019ll start with In Times Of War \u2014 she is a daughter of Street Cry out of Magic Millions winner Military Rose. She\u2019s always had the boom on her and fair enough too. The filly was beaten a nose on debut then went to a midweeker at Rosehill and was 0.2-lens to Spright! No wonder In Times Of War won 15-days later in a WF maiden. Now keep in mind that the runner-up that day was Zonk whom I and plenty others are saying is stakes class. It\u2019s just such deep form that she had to go on top of Pound Sterling but not by much. Pound Sterling is set up beautifully to win. He is 4s 1-1-1 at the venue, 1s 0-1-0 at the t/d and 1s 1w on heavy. 1. MEDLYN (67) was fabulously impressive winning on debut here on the heavy 9 on Mar 22. It was a huge win in every way but the class rise is quite enormous as it has turned out.\n\nRACE 8\n\n4. CONARCHIE (75) has conditions tailor-made for a win tomorrow. The Clarry Conners trained local loves racing at home and he loves it more when it\u2019s soggy. While he is not perhaps at his peak fresh (5s 1w) he has been really good in the two trials leading into this. Well worth a look on an each-way basis. 15. EL SID (66) creates a lot of interest. I remember him beating Bezel first-up last prep and thinking he might be a handy type. He didn't' win again and was actually a bit ordinary a few times not so when 4th to Russian Revolution and Morton\u2019s Fork at Randwick in the deep winter. Loved his trials to bit \u2014 no one\u2019s better at getting them ready first-up than this stable. 16. LAY DOWN THE LAW (65) is trained by Clarry\u2019s son Marc so it could be a Conners-a-thon here. Marc has only had this bloke for 2 runs and one of them was a 0.2-lens at $81 to Crafty Cop at Canterbury on Feb 17. He proved it was no fluke with that win here next time at $13. Both runs on heavy 8 \u2014 this is one seriously adept wet tracker. Why can\u2019t he win this? No reason at all.",

        "body0": "Cooper Cronk and his partner Tara Rushton. He is giving up his Melbourne Storm career to move to Sydney to be with her. (Pic: Supplied)\n\nI GUSHED when I heard that Storm star Cooper Cronk had decided to leave his Melbourne home to \u2018live life\u2019 with fiancee and Fox Sports presenter Tara Rushton in Sydney.\n\nMy immediate reaction was a heartfelt one. I felt excited for her, and I felt pride for him.\n\n\u201cTara, my fiancee, is based in Sydney, and there are a few things in life that are more important than football, like family, getting married and a future,\u201d the 33-year-old Victorian-based halfback said yesterday.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been pretty selfish in my approach to my football career and I think it\u2019s time I put someone else and something else first.\n\n\u201cFootball is great but I need a balance outside of that and I don\u2019t have that here in Melbourne.\n\n\u201cI get on a plane every other spare minute in Melbourne (to see Rushton) and it\u2019s getting harder to get back on that plane to come back so in the best interest of this football club it\u2019s the right decision at the right time.\u201d\n\nBalance, as we know, is something we all strive for and rarely achieve.\n\nThere\u2019s no need to say life is busy these days, because it\u2019s just fact. Everyone feels pushed to their limits, busting their guts to keep the wheels moving and avoid crashing into imminent roadblocks along the way.\n\nCelebrity or not, I think it\u2019s pretty special for someone to move states, move countries, move their lives \u2014 for love. It shows compromise, dedication, and faith in a relationship worth following.\n\nCronk's too expensive 0:30 NRL: South Sydney coach Michael Maguire says Cooper Cronk is too expensive in light of the news that the halfback is moving to Sydney.\n\nAnd it would happen every day. But Cronk, a two-time Dally M Medal winner, has developed his champion career with his Melbourne club, who he has played with for the last 14 years.\n\nIt would have been a pretty hard decision to make. He\u2019s kicking goals career-wise, and would have felt torn with loyalty to teammates and a club who has nurtured his talent every step of the way. So to press pause and move interstate at a crucial time, knowing footy careers can be short lived, is brave.\n\nAnd it\u2019s a timely reminder that \u2018life\u2019 should come first.\n\nIf being with the person you love makes you happy, then that\u2019s what you should do. If hopping on and off planes every few days is exhausting and stressful and complicated, then it should stop.\n\nBecause with happiness comes a sense of achievement, and a new sense of self-worth. He will know, as will she, that they did everything possible to make their life work \u2014 and make it work together.\n\nDistance is often the biggest relationship killer, with Married at First Sight newlyweds showing how hard it can be to commit to a new life. There were lots of great matches, but in most cases one partner was unwilling to give up everything to fit into their partner\u2019s world.\n\nSacrifice is a big deal. It shows we value another person, and putting our needs second shows that you can\u2019t live without them. And that you don\u2019t want to.\n\nSo for Cronk to make that decision shows guts. And it made me smile because quite often it\u2019s the female in a relationship who puts her career on hold, in most cases to have babies and raise a family.\n\nWhile many men I know would love to stay home and do the same, my husband included, often it makes financial sense for it to happen the other way around.\n\nSo maybe Cronk and Rushton have made a deal \u2014 he makes the sacrifice now, just like she will likely sacrifice later when, and if, they decide to have babies together.\n\nAnd of course, everyone knows he will be fine. He\u2019s on the big bucks and no doubt NSW teams have already thrown buckets of cash his way to sign the big name.\n\nSo now, they can start a new life.\n\nA healthy one, and one they\u2019ve obviously thought through and planned together. Sounds like a winning team to me.",

I'm in a position where I'm getting old now.

It's one of those things, I've said time and time again, you want to get it right.\n\n\"I'm in discussions with the club and hopefully we can come to an agreement soon.\"\n\nThe light-hearted talk continued when Johnson remarked his future at the Warriors could be settled quickly if Foran also committed to stay at the club.\n\nBoth players are capable of commanding seven-figure salaries but the Warriors are desperate to sign them long-term and keep them at the centre of their all-Kiwis test spine, between hooker Issac Luke and fullback Roger Tuivasa-Sheck.\n\n\"Of course they can,\" Johnson's replied when asked if the Warriors had the cash reserves to retain the pair. \"[Foran re-signing] would definitely help the situation. You want to play with the best players and he's definitely one of them.\n\n\"It's no secret how good a mate he is to me and you want to play with your mates. I'm sure, not just me but the club in general, would love to have him stay on for however long he wants.\"\n\nThe pair took limited part in today's training in wet conditions at Mt Smart Stadium, with Foran continuing to manage a hamstring strain and Johnson recovering from a knock to his leg.\n\nForward pair Bodene Thompson (bruised heel) and Jacob Lillyman (hamstring) were also on restricted duties but the latter was running freely and completed the session alongside the rest of NRL squad.\n\nVice-captain Simon Mannering was given a day off his feet and completed a gym session instead, but coach Stephen Kearney expected all five players to turn out in Sunday's home game against Parramatta.\n\n\"A few guys have a few bumps and bruises and that's the case every week,\" said Kearney. \"Jacob warmed up with that (rehab) group but he jumped in for the rest of the session. And Shaun just took a whack on his legs.\"\n\nBoth sides have two wins under their belt after five rounds with the Warriors looking to go back-to-back while the visitors are desperate to halt a three-game losing run.\n\n- NZ Herald",

After guiding the Michael Roebuck-trained Bel Burgess to his fourth-straight win in Race 7, Childs got Spanner Head home for Archie Alexander in the final event.\n\nMertens has ridden 27 winners on the metropolitan circuit since the start of February, including 10 across the past fortnight.\n\nHe is well-placed to make further ground on Williams on Saturday, when he has a full book of rides on the nine-event Caulfield card while Williams is chasing Group 1 glory in Sydney.\n\nAmong Mertens' book are leading fancies Sebring Dream (Race 3), Thermal Current (Race 5), Great Esteem (Race 7) and Boom Time (Race 8).\n\nWATCH: Mertens' victory on Single Note",
