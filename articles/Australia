        "body1": "His case showed us that the erroneous invocation of 'free speech' is effectively providing cover for hate spewers   Even with his name splashed in the headlines and his story cast as  breaking news   the last thing this is about is Milo Yiannopoulos  To precis  in case you sensibly missed the whole thing  this hate spouting  Donald Trump supporting  far right trollster had a lucrative book deal cancelled and a major speaking engagement at the American Conservative Union's CPAC conference revoked after comments he made  apparently saying sex between  younger boys  and older men was OK  surfaced online   He then resigned from the far right Breitbart news   following reports that some of his colleagues had threatened to quit if he wasn't sacked over those comments seeming to condone paedophilia  though Milo says they were taken out of context    The internet is replete with background and detail on this story   and has been for some time  But  again  this isn't about one individual far right provocateur  It's mostly about the busting of a persistent myth  that the far right  in strange symbiosis with some liberals who should know better  are the new champions of free speech   You know  that noble far right cause cheered by US TV host Bill Maher just the other day  when he so agreeably had Milo on his HBO Real Time talk show and they both told us to stop being so sensitive over things such as racism and misogyny   WATCH   Does anti trolling law inhibit free speech   2 26   Truth to be told  In truth  it is rare that reality so neatly punctures a point  For commentators have repeatedly cautioned that far right hate speech around Muslims and minorities gets absolved in a way that nobody would dream of doing if the subject were  just by way of stark illustration  child abuse   Well  now here's the proof  Previously supportive conservatives and publishers couldn't back away from Milo fast enough once those comments about sex with underage boys came to light   Those who had previously insisted we should debate the hate  not shut it down  seemed to vanish into thin air  It turns out that   who knew    there are limits to free speech  after all  and even for the far right   Conservative movements that have been politically revitalised by accommodating and thus rehabilitating the far right need to do their own reckoning with this equation and its consequences   The hard currency of all this  meanwhile  is the outrage  the reaction to having conversations ambushed and derailed by trolls for whom the sole purpose is to ambush and derail   But meanwhile  what of all the liberal minded insistence that characters such as Milo are really a test of our commitment to free speech and the right to offend   Of course  this was always a terrible conflation of free speech principles with the decision to provide platform and airtime to people who use these to mainline hateful bigotry   support for free speech confused with actively giving someone a megaphone   But it's now up to those who insist it was a free speech issue to begin with  to explain why those limits didn't apply when the abuse and harassment campaigns were directed only at women  ethnic minorities or the transgender community   WATCH   Rising Islamophobia concerns US Muslims  2 15   'Pwned '  The hard currency of all this  meanwhile  is the outrage  the reaction to having conversations ambushed and derailed by trolls for whom the sole purpose is to ambush and derail   This is one of many reasons why there is little point in engaging with the hate preachers of the far right  even when you think you've won the argument  it will be cast as losing  slapped on YouTube with a headline about being  owned  or  destroyed  by the hater   In this context  there is a certain arrogance in thinking that you will be the one who prevails  who will  win  using calm logic and clear reasoned debate   when in reality  all that's ever achieved by such an exchange is amplification of hate  giving it more platform  more reach and more legitimacy   When American journalist Jeremy Scahill pulled out of Bill Maher's Real Time  because the show was also hosting Milo  it was premised on this understanding   As Scahill wrote  the alt right provocateur  has ample venues to spew his hateful diatribe  There is no value in 'debating' him    As every shock jock and far right agitator knows  there is something compulsive about the shock in this context  a morbid fascination combined with a sort of earnestly breathless anthropological drive to understand why the spewer of hate is so awful   OPINION  Is this really how fascism takes hold in the US   This is what the erroneous invocation of  free speech  is effectively providing cover for   it operates as a seemingly principled and intellectual framing of something that is often propelled by less worthy impulses   Again  it works only if you are not a target of the abuse and don't comprehend the harm in it  But this does in part explain why toxic far right talk is so ubiquitously sought out and hosted   it might advocate the most appalling hatred against Muslims  or women but  wow  look at those retweets   It's why lucrative book deals and TV slots are available  And it's why there will always be Milos   because we seem intent on making sure that they will always have an audience

        "body0": "Bill Maher  the controversial liberal host of Real Time  says he s to thank for the fall of former Breitbart editor Milo Yiannopoulos   Maher  who interviewed Yiannopoulos on his show over the weekend  told the New York Times on Tuesday night   About a week ago  I went on Van Jones s show  and somebody asked me about the booking  I hadn t really gotten into the details of Milo yet  He was just getting on my radar  I said  specifically  sunlight is the best disinfectant  Then we had Milo on  despite the fact that many people said   Oh  how dare you give a platform to this man   What I think people saw was an emotionally needy Ann Coulter wannabe  trying to make a buck off of the left s propensity for outrage  And by the end of the weekend  by dinnertime Monday  he s dropped as a speaker at CPAC  Then he s dropped by Breitbart  and his book deal falls through  As I say  sunlight is the best disinfectant  You re welcome   The timeline here is broadly correct  Yiannopoulos did go on Maher s show  only to be dropped by the 2017 Conservative Political Action Conference  CPAC   his publishers  and Breitbart in the following days   But as it s commonly said  correlation is not causation  Yiannopoulos s fall had nothing to do with what he did on Maher s show   On Real Time  Yiannopoulos regurgitated his boilerplate free speech defense   that he says offensive things because he believes in free speech so much that he feels he should be able to say and do whatever he wants   and claimed that transgender people are  disordered   These remarks sparked outrage among the left  who were upset that Maher gave Yiannopoulos a platform to make his typical bigoted talking points   But it wasn t angry liberals who brought Yiannopoulos down  Instead  what brought Yiannopoulos down was conservatives disowning him  That happened not after they learned of Yiannopoulos s racist  sexist  transphobic  and other bigoted remarks  but after a July 2016 clip   from months before he appeared on Maher s show   was resurfaced by the conservative website Reagan Battalion following news that Yiannopoulos was invited to give a speech at CPAC   In the clip  Yiannopoulos defended the idea of  13 year olds  having sex with  older men   He argued   In the homosexual world  particularly  some of those relationships between younger boys and older men   the sort of  coming of age  relationships   the relationships in which those older men help those young boys to discover who they are and give them security and safety and provide them with love and a reliable sort of rock    Here is the uncut 5 minute video of Milo Yiannopoulos advocating for Pederasty involving  13 Year old  and  older men   HIS WORDS  Mschlapp pic twitter com mAgmfpuyvu   The Reagan Battalion   ReaganBattalion  February 20  2017  This   not anything that Yiannopoulos said on Maher s show   is what brought him down among conservatives  Although conservative organizations like CPAC and Breitbart had originally argued that they supported Yiannopoulos despite his past offensive remarks because they supported his free speech  they ultimately disowned him when his speech went too far for them   Take  for example  what American Conservative Union Chair Matt Schlapp said in regard to CPAC dropping Yiannopoulos   Due to the revelation of an offensive video in the past 24 hours condoning pedophilia  the American Conservative Union has decided to rescind the invitation of Milo Yiannopoulos to speak at the Conservative Political Action Conference    We initially extended the invitation knowing that the free speech issue on college campuses is a battlefield where we need brave  conservative standard bearers    In other words  Yiannopoulos s  free speech  insulting and stereotyping minorities  women  and LGBTQ people was fine for CPAC  but his  free speech  about pedophilia went too far   So Maher is right that sunlight was the best disinfectant in Yiannopoulos s case  Once conservatives saw who he really was  they no longer liked him   But everything Yiannopoulos said on Maher s show was his typical spiel  doing little to change how conservatives viewed Yiannopoulos  That change only came about after a conservative blog  in response to Yiannopoulos s invitation to speak at CPAC  resurfaced Yiannopoulos s months old child molestation comments  leading to outrage within the movement   For more on Milo Yiannopoulos s fall  read Vox s explainer ",

out and cook Laffa bread much like the rumali roti back home At the Carmel market Tel Aviv  Israel   Old gold  Bakery Said Abuelafia   Sons in the old town of Jaffa  on the outskirts of Tel Aviv  has been hot and happening since 1879  It seems chaotic at first glance  There is loud conversation  the roar of the fire and the clang of vessels  but stand there long enough and you begin to see a pattern  The venerable baker was not too pleased to have us traipsing around with cameras  I think we disturbed his rhythm  There was a bewildering array of pastries  some sweet and some savoury  but I lusted after the bread and had warm  fresh out of the glowing oven bread with fragrant zatar on top  I am told they also serve cardamom coffee  but being a South Indian filter coffee snob  I kept away   It is hot and happening since 1879  Bakery Said Abuelafia   Sons in the old town of Jaffa  Israel  Sabbath special  Challah  pronounced khala  is everywhere  in posh restaurants as well as streetside bakeries  It is largely a ceremonial bread eaten by the Jews on the Sabbath  It is beautiful to behold and is shiny golden and prettily plaited  It is considered a blessing to bake the bread in Jewish homes  where a bit of it is always set aside as an offering  It represents many things of significance  and is an everyday reminder of their God  The challah is made with nothing more than flour  oil and eggs  There are different shapes for different holy holidays  Bread is considered a miracle  and on the Sabbath  the bread is always torn with the hand   If you are hi tech you can brand your bread too  Seen here  pita bread announcing the Open Restaurants Week in Jerusalem   The writing s on the bread  If you are hi tech  you can brand your bread too  Seen here is pita bread announcing Open Restaurants Jerusalem  There is technology everywhere and the Israelis don t see why their staple breads should be left out  Young entrepreneurs have found ways to give their holy staple a digital makeover  At a centre   an old building that was left abandoned and is now made over   young entrepreneurs hang out and display their entrepreneurial skills  Chefs and cookbook writers  food scientists and just plain old food lovers gather to exchange ideas and find ways to take Israel to the next level  And the bread offers young chefs many avenues to experiment and innovate  The writing s on the bread   Bread rules  Chocolate croissants  chocolate rugelach  are for the asking at Mahane Yehuda Market in Jerusalem  The souk  established in the late 1800s  is a typical West Asian market with many bakeries  fruits  vegetables  olives and spices  Vendors holler out  inviting you to sample their wares  And this venerable Hasidic Jew gave me one reproachful look and then completely ignored me as I shamelessly photographed him buying bread  Many Hasidic Jews live in an old conservative quarter of Jerusalem  called Mea Shearim  100 Gates   They are ultra orthodox  prefer keeping to themselves  don t like the Internet and try to keep alive the traditional way of life as spoken in the Torah  They bake great bread  meticulously following the complicated rules of the Sabbath   The falafel phenomenon  everywhere you go in Israel  Fulfilling falafel   Eat falafel   said my boss  rather unfeelingly I thought  when I asked her if a vegetarian like me was the right choice to visit Open Restaurants Jerusalem  You have to understand the fears of a vegetarian travelling to unknown lands  Starvation is a real possibility  So everywhere I went  the first thing I did was put up my hand and ask if they had falafel  They did  And I always came away fulfilled and happy  Why not  when the meal is a combination of warm and pillowy pita bread  bulging with colourful veggies and lashings of hummus and really flavourful olive oil  It is crunchy  chewy and oozy all at the same time  The cutlet inside adds crispness  and I ate it so inelegantly that stuff dribbled down my chin   In the old town of Jerusalem  a cart stands pretty as a picture laden with bread   Cart on a cobbled street  On an ancient cobbled street in the old town of Jerusalem stood a cart laden with bread  begging to be photographed  This was in the quarter of town where Christ was said to have once walked  It is not uncommon to see several such carts in the old part of Jerusalem  And somehow this seemed extra special  thanks to the biblical connotations  Not too far away is Via Dolorosa where Christ is supposed to have walked to his crucifixion  It is a moving experience walking past the stations of the cross and placing one s palm on the same wall where Christ put his hand as he supported himself when he stopped to rest  The smell of bread is everywhere  fragrant and comforting  as is the sight of little bakeries all along the pathway  where ovens glow and bakers bake   At Mount Zion Hotel in Jerusalem  man can live on bread alone  On bread alone  At Mount Zion Hotel in Jerusalem  contrary to what we know  man and woman can live on bread alone  They rule the breakfast buffet  And I swear  the table groaned as I flitted from croissant to challah  from baguette to plain old rye bread  Everything I picked from there tasted incredible with the accompanying home made preserves  labneh  date honey or even just by itself  Of course  you can have it with a selection of meats and eggs to order  I just worked my way from one end of the bread table to the other and  as no one knew me there and couldn t point out that I was eating too much  I had a party all by myself  I spread the bread with herbed butters  several varieties of honey and fresh fruit jams  With a devil may care abandon  I threw my carb count completely out of whack   Spice Route  While the Westerners went oooh and aaah in the souks over the colourful spices  for me it was familiar stuff  But still  seeing them all laid out made me pause and wonder about the number of masalas we use in our cooking  There was coriander  cumin  turmeric  pepper    Visually spectacular and I did enjoy some superior moments pointing out the various masalas and holding forth on how we use it  That is the other thing that is comforting in Israel  Many of their ingredients are similar to ours  There are sesame seeds  poppy seeds  dill  yoghurt and even a beautiful dessert made with sabu dana

        "body1": "Kim Stephens and Olivia Lambert news com au  IN THE digital age  police investigating a murder have even more tools available to them   When Melbourne woman Jill Meagher vanished after a night out in September 2012  it was her mobile phone signal that led detectives to her rapist and killer   More than two years later  when NSW school cleaner Vincent Stanford raped and murdered bride to be Stephanie Scott  it was his phone s location that enabled police to find the young teacher s body   Late last year  the mobile phone signal of missing Melbourne woman Karen Ristevski gave detectives a major breakthrough   Her disappearance in June initially baffled police   But late last year  it was revealed pings from phones belonging to both her and her husband Borce placed them both on the Calder Freeway  near Gisborne  the day she went missing   A search area was centred near where her mobile was last located   Two months on  a bushwalker discovered her decomposed body wedged between two logs in the Macedon Regional Park  about 25km from the search area   Charges are yet to be laid over Ms Ristevski s death   While killers dumping bodies in remote bush locations is nothing new  placing them at crime scenes has never been easier  thanks to the ubiquitous 21st century mobile phone   Unfortunately for detectives  however  the technology can only be used as an aid in investigations   Private investigator Scott Ross told the Diligentia Group said while mobile phone pings have helped solve crimes  it can t be taken as hard evidence  like DNA   Unbeknown to many  however  is that even if a phone is turned off  it runs a hidden operating system that is always turned on   The system constantly sends pings to phone towers and is always searching for the closest or strongest signal   The towers keep a log of those pings   The constant stream of pings between multiple towers allow investigators to triangulate a phone s location based on the strength at each tower   A phone s location can be more accurately pinpointed when there are more phone towers  so in cities people can be tracked constantly   According to The New Yorker  there are some things your mobile phone can t tell police and the pings don t always point to a person s guilt   A woman named Lisa Marie Roberts  from Portland in the US  served almost 10 years in prison for a crime she didn t commit   She was convicted on mobile phone pings that placed her at the crime scene   Roberts was found guilty of strangling her girlfriend Jerri Lee Williams  who had a history of drug use and prostitution  in 2002   During the investigation police found Roberts made a call that bounced off a mobile tower less than five kilometres from where Williams  body was found   The chief executive of Cherry Biometrics  a company of mobile tower and mobile phone tracking experts  told The New Yorker towers were not always completely reliable   Michael Cherry said the assumption was when you made a phone call  your phone bounced off the closest tower and from that alone  police could identify your exact location   He said that s not how it works   But for a number of high profile cases in recent years  mobile phone towers have provided homicide investigators with the crucial breakthrough   ADRIAN BAYLEY  HAD the killer of Melbourne woman Jill Meagher not carried her phone with him when he dumped her body beside a remote country road in 2012  she may still be in her shallow  lonely grave   In a case that rocked Australia  Bayley accosted Ms Meagher in Brunswick as she walked the short distance to her home from a nearby bar  in the early hours of September 22   After raping and murdering her in a laneway  he returned to his home for his car  which he then used to transport her body   Ms Meagher s mobile phone signal revealed she had remained in the Brunswick area until 4 24am  when it began to move   Pinging on mobile phone towers revealed it moved north along the CityLink toll road in the vicinity of Moreland Road at 4 40am and then continued north along the Calder Freeway to Sunbury   CityLink records led police to Bayley   and his mobile phone records   obtained by detectives  revealed its movements that morning were identical to those of Ms Meagher s phone   Bayley was arrested and  during questioning  broke down and confessed when presented with Ms Meagher s broken Vodafone SIM card  which his partner had found in the bottom of her washing machine   He led police to her body and was later sentenced to life in jail   VINCENT STANFORD  The rapist and murderer of schoolteacher Stephanie Scott had confessed to his crimes five days after she went missing but the exact location of her charred body remained a mystery   The much loved 26 year old was days away from being married when she was raped and murdered by Leeton High School cleaner Vincent Stanford on Easter Sunday  2015   The 25 year old cleaner then used the bride to be s car to drive her naked body to Cocoparra National Park  about 70km northeast of Leeton  where he set it alight   Stanford confessed to the crime after his alibi that he was shopping at a local grocery store at the time of Ms Scott s murder came unstuck  when a simple police check found the store did not open on Easter Sunday   But it was not he who led police to her charred remains but his mobile phone signal   Officers said a triangulation of phone towers in the area helped them narrow the search area  which enabled them to find her body  dumped just five metres from a remote dirt road in dense bushland   Stanford pleaded guilty to murder and was sentenced to life in jail   He told police he killed Ms Scott because   He wanted to kill    DANIEL HOLDOM  It s not just the advent of smartphones with their GPS location services that have aided police in murder investigations   Back in 2008  Daniel James Holdom allegedly killed 20 year old Karlie Pearce Stevenson in the Belanglo State Forest on either December 14 or 15   Five days later  he allegedly murdered her two year old daughter  Khandalyce Pearce and dumped her body in a suitcase beside a South Australian highway   Karlie s skeletal remains were not found until 2010  while the discovery of the toddler s body was not made until 2015   The two bodies  dumped 1000km apart  were not initially thought to be connected  however a tip off to Crime Stoppers led to DNA testing that confirmed they were mother and daughter and investigators were  most likely  hunting a double murderer   Holdom was charged with Karlie s murder in 2015  after police traced a phone that allegedly belonged to the 41 year old through pings off mobile phone towers in the Belanglo State Forest   The pings allegedly put the phone near the location where Karlie s remains were found  at about the time of her death   He was later also charged with Khandalyce s murder   Holdom is yet to stand trial   TODD KOHLHEPP  In the case of US woman Kala Brown  police were able to use pings from mobile phone towers to rescue her before she became a victim of alleged serial killer Todd Kohlhepp last year   Police discovered the 30 year old  allegedly chained up like a dog inside a shipping container on Kohlhepp s 95 acre property in South Carolina  two months after she and her boyfriend  Charlie Carver vanished   Kohlhepp  a registered sex offender  allegedly shot Mr Carver dead in front of Ms Brown   The bodies of another couple in their 20s  Meagan and Johnny Coxie  were also found on his property   Police were able to find the terrified Ms Brown by tracing the last pings her phone transmitted before her phone battery died   Pings were sent between multiple towers  which allowed investigators to triangulate the

        "body0": "Lena Bell in Washington DC and Claire Bickers News Corp Australia Network  FOREIGN Affairs Minister Julie Bishop Bishop has categorically denied the refugee resettlement deal with the United States was part of a  people swap    Speaking in Washington after meeting US vice president Mike Pence  Ms Bishop categorically denied the refugee resettlement deal with the United States was part of a  people swap    The assertion put her at odds with Immigration Minister Peter Dutton  who said on Tuesday night that he did not have a problem if people wanted to categorise it as a people swap deal    It was beneficial to the US  and it was beneficial to us   Mr Dutton said   But Ms Bishop said   That s not the way I would categorise it     Australia is a very generous nation when it comes to resettling those who are found to be refugees from all over the world  We ll continue to do so   she said    We are seeking to resettle a number of people who came via the people smuggling trade and have been in Nauru in particular with the United States  But we will continue to take refugees from across the world  as we ve always done    Ms Bishop has invited US vice president Mike Pence to visit Australia  as soon as possible    Discussions are also underway to lock in a time for Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull to meet President Trump face to face in Washington later this year   But so far there s no talk of President Trump making a trip Down Under   TRUMP DOWN UNDER  Is Australia trying to avoid the kind of embarrassing backlash British Prime Minister Theresa May is facing in the UK   Possibly  In January  thousands of protesters took to the streets across the UK and more than 1 5 million people signed a petition to try to stop Trump making a state visit after May issued an invitation to the new US President   May stood by the invite despite the opp  Ms Bishop said Prime Minister Turnbull and President Trump would meet and  continue to engage as leaders of our nations always have and always will    She said it was important for a senior member of the Trump administration to visit Australia and the pacific region and had issued an invitation to Vice President Pence during their meeting   Secretary Mattis had already been in Korea and Japan  she said    Secretary of Defence  James Mattis  has been in South Korea and Japan     and I m hoping that the vice president will also be able to visit Australia when he tours the region   she said   VICE PRESIDENTIAL VISITS  If Vice President Pence does visit Australia  it will be the first time a VP has visited before a US President in nearly 30 years   Australia didn t see a visit from a US president for two decades between 1969 and 1989 while Richard Nixon  Gerald Ford  Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan were in office   Nixon sent his Vice President Spiro Agnew in 1970  Ford sent Nelson Rockefeller in 1976  Carter sent Walter Mondale in 1978 and Reagan sent George Bush senior in 1982   While Bush senior was in the Oval Office  his Vice President Dan Quayle visited Australia in 1989   two years before Bush himself made the trip   Barack Obama s Vice President Joe Biden made just one trip to Australia  in mid 2016  as the Obama administration was on its way out  while George W  Bush s deputy Dick Cheney visited Australia in 2007   Bill Clinton s Vice President Al Gore never visited Australia while in office   BISHOP DENIES DEAL IS A  PEOPLE SWAP   A  VERY WARM  AND  FRIENDLY  DISCUSSION  The Minister s visit follows soon after the controversy about the now infamous  worst call  between US President Donald Trump and Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull   Ms Bishop described her first face to face meeting with the Vice President as  very warm  and  friendly     We spoke about many things    The meeting went longer than scheduled  which is always a good sign  because we had so many issues to discuss  And we exchanged information and ideas and it was a positive  constructive  discussion  We spoke about areas where we re working together  areas where we have common challenges and where Australia and the United States can hopefully solve some of the issues confronting our region and globally    We are very strong strategic and defence partners    We are very strong economic partners    It s a great basis upon which to strengthen this already remarkable relationship    Speaking to News Corp Australia  Ms Bishop said top of the agenda was the Australia US relationship and the upcoming US review on Syria and Iraq sought by the new Trump administration    Obviously we have a deep interest in any change of strategy or thinking on that  Syria and Iraq  so that was one of the issues that we discussed   she said   I took the opportunity to provide our thinking and ideas on what we d like the review to address    Ms Bishop said both military and political solutions were discussed as part of a whole range of issues that need to be considered in determining an outcome in Iraq and Syria    We have a very close defence and military strategic relationship with the US and the administration has been expressing its appreciation for the role Australia plays   she said   Asked about Australia s commitment to the Trans Pacific Partnership  TPP   Ms Bishop said that Australia was  very keen to maintain the principals and the spirit of the TPP both economically and strategically    Mr Trump walked away from the ambitious  12 nation trade deal brokered by the Obama administration last month  He declared an end to the era of multinational trade agreements that have defined global economics for decades   In her first face to face meeting with US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson  Ms Bishop is also expected to discuss Australia s Mideast military commitment  as well as a regional response to North Korea ",
