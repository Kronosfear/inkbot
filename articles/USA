The brand has certainly made wellness a priority in recent years, ditching all artificial ingredients and being more transparent about what\u2019s in its food. Even just this week, Panera launched its own line of beverages\u2014with half the amount of sweetners as soda\u2014and became the first food chain to list added sugar on all its fountain drink dispensers. \u201cYou should feel completely comfortable asking anything you want [to make] the menu work for your individual needs.\u201d Plus, Panera is all about letting you personalize your order to create better-for-you combos, says Sara Burnett, the restaurant\u2019s director of nutrition and wellness. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen anyone say no when a [customer] requests a modification,\u201d she says. \u201cSo you should feel completely comfortable asking anything you want [to make] the menu work for your individual needs.\u201d Still, it helps to know some insider info\u2014and Burnett shared a few off-the-menu alterations to make over your next meal. Keep reading for 3 Panera Bread healthy-food hacks you never knew you could do. Get Started\n\n2/4 Add some plant power to the breakfast menu At first glance, the majority of Panera\u2019s a.m. offerings have a good protein-carb balance, but they\u2019re missing one thing: veggies. \u201cYou can add tomato, spinach, and avocado to any breakfast sandwich,\u201d Burnett says. \u201cIn fact, I like to add a little bit of veggies to all of them!\u201d Oh, and bonus: Almost all of the add-ons are completely free. (Though, your fave healthy fat, avocado, is extra.) Burnett has another breakfast hack for when she\u2019s in more of a hot cereal mood. \u201cOur oatmeal comes with dried apples as a topping, but what I do is nix the topping and ask for a fresh apple on the side instead. Then I cut it up myself and add it in.\u201d And just like that, you add vitamins A, B, and C to your meal.\n\n3/4 Green-ify your mac and cheese Some days, you walk into Panera Bread and the Green Goddess salad is calling your name. Other days, all you want is that warm mac and cheese. But there\u2019s a sneaky little trick for making the go-to comfort food more nutritious. (Turns out, it\u2019s the same one that rockstar vegan chef Isa Chandra Moskowitz relies on.) \u201cOrder a cup of mac and cheese instead of a whole, so that you have a half portion. Then, order a cup of kale on the side. When you sit down, you can mix them together so you\u2019re still eating a full meal, but half of it\u2019s greens,\u201d Burnett says. Just be prepared for the person at the next table to be eyeing your lunch, wondering how she missed it on the menu.",

        "body1": "The battle over President Trump\u2019s Supreme Court nominee was on full display Wednesday morning in the Senate, where one Democratic senator was delivering a marathon speech against Judge Neil Gorsuch that started Tuesday evening.\n\nSen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), a staunch Gorsuch critic, started speaking on the Senate floor just before 7 p.m. Eastern on Tuesday evening. Over the next 12 hours, he portrayed Gorsuch as an extreme nominee, took aim at Trump and slammed Republicans for not moving ahead with President Barack Obama\u2019s nomination of Merrick Garland to the court last year.\n\n\u201cTo proceed to fill this stolen seat will damage the court for decades to come,\u201d he said Wednesday morning. On Tuesday night, Merkley said he planned \u201cto keep speaking for quite a while longer, as long as I\u2019m able.\u201d\n\nMerkley\u2019s speech came as the Senate plowed toward a historic and bitter showdown over Gorsuch that is expected to conclude Friday with a significant change to Senate rules that will result in his confirmation.\n\nA parade of lawmakers took to the Senate floor Tuesday to deliver politically charged speeches for and against Gorsuch. More are expected on Wednesday.\n\nThere was no sign of compromise as the chamber formally opened debate on Gorsuch. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) predicted will be confirmed on Friday before senators leave town for the two-week Easter recess.\n\nMerkley\u2019s speech has no impact on the schedule.\n\nIn a Tuesday speech on the Senate floor, McConnell faulted Democrats for \u201churtling toward the abyss\u201d and \u201ctrying to take the Senate with them.\u201d He urged them to \u201creconsider\u201d their tactics.\n\n\u201cIt appears as if cloture will not be invoked, but we\u2019ll find out on Thursday,\u201d McConnell later told reporters, referring to an expected Democratic blockade of the federal appeals court judge in a Thursday procedural vote. \u201cBut either way, we\u2019ll be moving toward confirming Judge Gorsuch.\u201d\n\nOnly four Democrats have vowed they will side with Republicans to break that blockade and move to consider Gorsuch on the Senate floor.\n\nThe Democratic obstruction is expected to prompt GOP leaders to eliminate a 60-vote requirement for Supreme Court nominees and allow confirmation of Gorsuch with a simple majority vote.\n\nThe partisan standoff underscores the sharp polarization that has seized Congress less than three months into Trump\u2019s presidency. Senate Democrats angered by Trump\u2019s policies \u2014 and McConnell\u2019s refusal to consider Garland \u2014 have united against Gorsuch, clinching enough votes to block him earlier this week.\n\nIt also heralds a potentially more contentious climate in the Senate, which traditionally has allowed the minority party to exert a powerful voice in debate over key nominations and legislation \u2014 unlike in the House.\n\nSenate Democrats changed the rules in 2013 to permit executive-branch nominees including federal judges to be approved by a simple majority, with the critical exception of Supreme Court selections.\n\n[Trump\u2019s Cabinet picks are likely to be easily confirmed. That\u2019s because of Senate Democrats.]\n\nBut doing away with the 60-vote barrier would eliminate the minority party\u2019s historic influence over who the president nominates to the high court and significantly decrease its ability to help exercise a check on the executive branch.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a reason they call it the \u2018nuclear option,\u2019 and that is that there\u2019s fallout. And this fallout will be dangerously and perhaps disastrously radioactive for the Senate in years to come,\u201d said Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.).\n\nThe nuclear option \u2014 in this case, allowing high court nominees to be approved by a simple majority \u2014 may also further poison relations between Democrats and Republicans as each side is embittered by the other\u2019s behavior. That could have a practical impact on Trump\u2019s agenda, such as passing a complex tax package, health-care legislation and an infrastructure plan.\n\nMcConnell said that while he is prepared to deploy the nuclear option to overcome Democratic resistance to Gorsuch, he vowed not to end the 60-vote threshold on legislation while he is majority leader, maintaining what is known on Capitol Hill as the filibuster as it pertains to making laws.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no sentiment to change the legislative filibuster,\u201d he said.\n\nSenate Democrats said the only way they will end their resistance is if Trump submits a new nominee. They portrayed Gorsuch as outside the mainstream and expressed doubts that he has sufficiently demonstrated his independence from Trump.\n\n\u201cIf Senator McConnell is willing to be reasonable and cooperate in a bipartisan way, we can avoid the nuclear option,\u201d said Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.).\n\nAs Democrats and Republicans took turns on the Senate floor on Tuesday, they delivered sharply contrasting speeches. Democrats repeatedly brought up Garland, casting Gorsuch as beholden to wealthy corporate interests and not average Americans. Democrats expressed concern about confirming Trump\u2019s nominee at a time when ties between his team and Russia have come under heavy scrutiny.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be honest,\u201d said Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.). \u201cI think it is crazy that we are considering confirming a lifetime Trump nominee to the Supreme Court at a moment when the president\u2019s campaign is under the cloud of an active, ongoing FBI counterintelligence investigation that could result in indictments and appeals that will go all the way to the Supreme Court so that Trump\u2019s nominee could be the deciding vote on whether Trump or his supporters broke the law and will be held accountable. That is nuts.\u201d\n\nRepublicans portrayed Gorsuch as a more-than-qualified and mainstream judge with sterling career credentials and accused Democrats of caving to their political base.\n\n\u201cTheir base demands total war, total obstruction, and they are begrudgingly bowing to this demand. Unfortunately for them, it has proven difficult to invent attacks against an obviously well-qualified judge,\u201d said Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.).\n\nThere were no signs, however, that senators were making serious moves on Tuesday to avoid the impasse. Signaling that any hopes of a compromise are probably dead, Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), who successfully brokered past disputes on judicial nominees, thanks to his close relationship with several Democrats, said that this time he is done trying.\n\nMcCain, who was part of a 2005 agreement among 14 senators of both parties to allow the confirmation of several of former president George W. Bush\u2019s federal court nominees without changing the rules, said talks between Democrats and Republicans in the past few days \u201cdidn\u2019t go anywhere.\u201d He declined to specify areas of disagreement.\n\nMeanwhile, the resistance against Gorsuch grew. Sen. Angus King of Maine, an independent who caucuses with the Democrats, announced he would join the Democrats\u2019 blockade.\n\nIn a written statement explaining his decision to oppose Gorsuch, King accused the judge of providing answers to questions in his confirmation hearings before the Senate Judiciary Committee that seemed \u201cat best, increasingly evasive, and, at worst, simply not forthright.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf I am opposed to this nomination, it seems logical to oppose cloture because under the current rules, this would defeat the nomination,\u201d King said.\n\nIn a sign that at least some senators still want to avoid the showdown, Sen. Christopher A. Coons (D-Del.) said that even though he plans to oppose Gorsuch and support the Democratic barricade, he is willing to work on an agreement that would stave off changes to how the Senate confirms Supreme Court nominees.\n\n\u201cThere are Democrats and Republicans who I hope will be talking this week, in the next two days, to see if we could find some path forward where we preserve the filibuster,\u201d Coons said in a CNN interview.\n\nSen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah), a senior member of the Judiciary Committee, said that he had been discussing a potential compromise with Democrats as recently as Monday but admitted \u201cI haven\u2019t made a real push\u201d to reach an agreement.\n\nPlans for a Democratic filibuster \u201care stupid. I think it\u2019s a big mistake,\u201d Hatch added.\n\n[How Senate Republicans will break the Democratic filibuster on Neil Gorsuch and get him on the Supreme Court]\n\nAll Republicans are expected to vote to confirm Gorsuch. Only a few Democrats will not stand in his way.\n\nDemocratic Sens. Joe Donnelly (Ind.), Heidi Heitkamp (N.D.) and Joe Manchin III (W.Va.) \u2014 all of whom are up for reelection in states won by Trump \u2014 say they plan to support Gorsuch. Sen. Michael F. Bennet (D-Colo.), who represents Gorsuch\u2019s home state, says he won\u2019t support the filibuster but has yet to signal whether he would vote to confirm Gorsuch on the floor.\n\nThe four were the only Democrats who joined with Republicans in the 55-to-44 vote to move ahead with debate on Gorsuch\u2019s nomination Tuesday.\n\nA single-party filibuster has never successfully blocked a Supreme Court nomination. A bipartisan coalition used the procedural vote to defeat Abe Fortas\u2019s 1968 nomination to be chief justice.\n\nFor weeks, Republicans have warned that they will not hesitate to change the chamber\u2019s rules to confirm the 49-year-old federal appeals court judge if Democrats block him. A rules change will require majority support.\n\nAsked Tuesday if he is confident he has the votes to make that change, McConnell replied simply: \u201cYes.\u201d\n\nRead more at PowerPost", 
        "body0": "Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-OR) left his office in the Senate Hart Building at around 6 pm Tuesday afternoon, walked to the US Capitol, and took to the Senate floor to criticize Donald Trump Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch.\n\nMore than 12 hours later, Merkley is still talking.\n\nThe Oregon senator is not technically filibustering Gorsuch\u2019s nomination: Instead, he is using the existing floor time allowed under Senate rules to highlight Democrats\u2019 opposition to Gorsuch, according to an aide.\n\nSen. Jeff Merkley says he's planning on holding the Senate floor *all night* to protest Judge Gorsuch & a 'stolen' SCOTUS seat \u2014via @MSNBC pic.twitter.com/gNPB6oGOAv \u2014 Kyle Griffin (@kylegriffin1) April 5, 2017\n\nOn Tuesday afternoon, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) filed for \u201ccloture\u201d \u2014 to move to a vote \u2014 on Gorsuch\u2019s nomination. Doing so set off a mandatory 30 hours to allow for debate before the cloture vote is held. Republicans do not have the 60 votes to reach cloture, and are expected to instead use the \u201cnuclear option\u201d to change Senate rules so Gorsuch can be confirmed with only 51 votes.\n\nDuring his speech, Merkley spoke about Gorsuch\u2019s career, talked at length of his rulings on sexual discrimination cases, and harped on the seat denied President Barack Obama nominee Merrick Garland, who was nominated to replace Antonin Scalia, who died in February 2016.\n\n\u201cThe majority team in this chamber decided to steal a Supreme Court seat,\u201d Merkley said. \u201cThe majority said, \u2018We intend to pack the court of the United States of America.\u2019 It was a warfare tactic of partisanship.\u201d\n\nMerkley became the first Democratic senator after Gorsuch\u2019s nomination was announced to promise to filibuster him. In an interview with Vox in his office on March 24, Merkley predicted that Democrats would come up with the votes to filibuster Gorsuch \u2014 a prediction that proved correct.\n\nSince he began speaking at 6:46 pm, Merkley drank from a bottle of water but has not eaten or sat down. His staff cites his completion of an Ironman triathlon in 2013.\n\nA transcript of my conversation with Merkley in March, edited for length and clarity, follows.\n\nJeff Stein\n\nFrom Obama\u2019s appointment of Merrick Garland, until the Republicans in the Senate refused to give him a hearing, until Gorsuch\u2019s confirmation hearing today, what has this whole Supreme Court fight taught you about American politics that you did not believe before?\n\nJeff Merkley\n\nWhat is dramatically different is that we are dealing with a seat in which the Senate did not abide by its responsibilities under the Constitution to seat Obama\u2019s nominee. That has not happened in our history.\n\nIt\u2019s important to keep recognizing that this is a seat stolen from President Obama, put into a time capsule, and delivered forward to the next president. Republicans did that in the hope, with the dream, that they\u2019d put forward a very different Court and put a very different judge up for confirmation than did President Obama.\n\nIf this succeeds, it\u2019s a precedent that\u2019s terribly destructive. Destructive to the Senate, because it will say, \u201cWe can refuse to do our job under the Constitution,\u201d and destructive to the integrity of the Court. Because the Court has been rigged if this nomination of Neil Gorsuch is successful.\n\nJeff Stein\n\nHow has this changed your tenor of thinking about working with Republicans? How has that story changed your understanding of how the Senate works?\n\nJeff Merkley\n\nWhen I came to the Senate in 2009, I heard that Mitch McConnell wasn\u2019t interested in solving problems and was all about power and obstruction. And I didn\u2019t really believe them.\n\nI felt when you come to the Senate, you have a responsibility to address issues. In short order, I discovered that those stories if anything undersold the fact that Mitch McConnell is completely motivated by political purpose. He didn\u2019t want to solve the problems facing America; he\u2019d do anything possible to undermine the success of President Obama\u2019s ability to be reelected.\n\nThe Senate looks so different than I saw as an intern for [Oregon] Sen. [Mark] Hatfield 41 years ago. So different than when I worked for Congress in the 1980s.\n\nJeff Stein\n\nDo you think the rest of your colleagues on the Democratic side recognize that?\n\nJeff Merkley\n\nThey absolutely recognize what Mitch McConnell has done and how it\u2019s undermined this institution. It was only a couple decades ago that everything in the Senate was done by simple majority.\n\nThe idea you\u2019d require a supermajority to get something done was reversed for very rare occasions. That has completely flipped now. Everything now is a supermajority.\n\nJeff Stein\n\nI hear you when you say that the Democratic caucus understands this is what McConnell is all about. But before the hearing, the Huffington Post came out with a story saying Democrats did not have the appetite for an all-out war on this. Some Democratic senators are saying, \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t try to treat Grouch the way they treated Garland.\u201d And there\u2019s a recognition Democrats have to play nice.\n\nIs that a mistake? Or is that an incorrect assessment of your colleagues\u2019 attitude?\n\nJeff Merkley\n\nWhen my colleagues say, \u201cWe\u2019re not going to treat Gorsuch the way Republicans treated Garland,\u201d what they\u2019re saying is, \u201cHe\u2019ll get a committee hearing; he\u2019ll get vetted in committee.\u201d Knowing Republicans have control, they know he\u2019ll get to the floor. But that floor vote may well be a vote on closing debate. And my colleagues are not saying they are committed to closing debate.\n\nHad the Republicans proceeded to hold hearings on Merrick Garland and put him on the floor and then voted on him \u2014 whether to table it or to defeat it, or so forth \u2014 that would have at least been in the realm of the Senate doing its job. But do not assume this means that people are going to be prepared to close debate, which is the more procedural way to describe what the filibuster is.\n\nJeff Stein\n\nLet me phrase this more directly: Are you worried Democrats are going to vote to confirm Gorsuch?\n\nJeff Merkley\n\nI believe Democrats will filibuster Gorsuch and will not vote to close debate. There is a concern. The concern is that some may say, as has been reported, \u201cWhy not strike a deal with Republicans? They agree to keep the rule in place, and we agree not to filibuster.\u201d\n\nWe have to realize this is a losing strategy. That simply means Republicans can agree to change the rule on the next individual.\n\nIf folks say, \u201cThis one doesn\u2019t really change the Court\u201d \u2014 absolutely it does. We have a 4-4 Court; you can look at the 5-4 Court, it\u2019s all anti-labor, anti-consumer, anti-environment decisions. And so there are enormous consequences to confirming this extreme far-right nominee.\n\nJeff Stein\n\nWhen I talk to more moderate Democrats, they see their institutional prerogatives as being in tension with the policy outcomes you\u2019re talking about. They see it as there being two axes to uphold \u2014 one that\u2019s being a good senator, following the Senate rules and traditions; and two, fighting for the progressive policies they believe in.\n\nDo you feel that for you or the rest of your colleagues, this second axis is taking over the first in importance?\n\nJeff Merkley\n\nI think the two are compatible.\n\nSenators who said, \u201cYes, we must have a committee hearing; we need to have a debate on the floor\u201d \u2014 that\u2019s the procedural side.\n\nBut that\u2019s not incompatible with voting against closing debate, because the policy consequences of this far-right judge are enormous. I\u2019ve listened to my Senate colleagues who two or three weeks ago were in neutral territory, who now reviewed case after case after case and met with, listened to, heard from Judge Gorsuch, and they\u2019re saying, \u201cI started out in the middle ground, but the more I find out he\u2019s the furthest-right judge ever put before the Senate, that is not compatible with our Constitution\u201d \u2014 well, these are my words at this point.\n\nThis is really a dynamic between the vision of a government that works of, by, and for the people and one that works of, by, and for the corporations. That\u2019s what\u2019s at stake here.",

Amber Rudd\u2019s demand that the big digital companies weaken the encryption they use on their messages is unrealistic and \u2013 if it ever became real \u2013 self-defeating. It is unrealistic because encryption cannot be selectively weakened, any more than the value of pi could be stipulated as 3.2 for the state of Indiana alone as proposed by some proto-Rudd politician in 1897. Mathematics is universal, and the mathematics on which strong encryption depends is quite as inflexible as that which specifies Earth\u2019s orbit round the sun. If the encryption on terrorists\u2019 messages were weakened so that the government could read them, the same weakening would apply to everyone else, however innocent. If the government believes it can prevail upon the likes of Facebook (which owns WhatsApp) to issue a specially weakened version of the program to British users only, it is being even more fatuously optimistic than in its approach to the Brexit negotiations. No company would sacrifice its reputation (and so its market share) in such a way, and real criminals could always find alternatives.\n\nEven if these powers were delivered by some miracle to our government and to no other they would still prove self-defeating. Terrorists and their active sympathisers form a tiny minority of any community. Their criminal messages and phone calls to each other form an infinitesimal fraction of all the chat and gossip on the internet. To find them at the moment is like searching for a needle in a haystack. The task won\u2019t be made easier by dumping another haystack full of chaff on to the needle, which would be the effect of Ms Rudd\u2019s proposal if it were ever practicable. The more thoughtful members of the security community know this already. The power that they really need, which is to know all about the friendship networks of suspected terrorists, is one they already have. What\u2019s known as \u201cmetadata\u201d tells them everything about a message except its content, and this is extraordinarily revealing. But the government has its own reasons for pursuing a noisy attack on the internet companies.\n\nThe good reason is that the internet giants can and must do much more about communications that are completely unencrypted. The hate sites and propaganda videos that flourish with the help of Google, partly because they are made visible and profitable through its search and advertising, and partly by their distribution on YouTube, which is owned by the same company, are frequently contrary to British law, if only because so many incite racial and religious hatred. The same is true of some Facebook groups. Twitter is a slightly different case but it has still been used to disseminate extremist propaganda.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Amber Rudd\u2019s demand that the big digital companies weaken the encryption they use on their messages is unrealistic. Photograph: Reuters\n\nAll of these companies have policies that they are not enforcing. All face considerable technical difficulties in dealing with the volume of traffic, but there is no reason to feel sorry for them. Overcoming great technical difficulties is what has made them their fortunes. It is time they employed these skills for the benefit of the wider society. The German government has set an excellent example there with its proposal to fine heavily companies that fail to take down obnoxious content quickly enough.\n\nThe bad reason for the government\u2019s public assault on the internet companies is just as urgent, though. We do not yet know how Khalid Masood was radicalised. But we do know that the last attempt to whip up public fury against Facebook on grounds of security came after the inquiry into the murder of Fusilier Lee Rigby had identified a series of mistakes by the security services. Those are the sort of failings for which a home secretary is ultimately responsible. No wonder she\u2019d rather spout rather sinister nonsense about encryption instead. The rest of us should not be fooled.", 
        "body0": "Photo\n\nI like to say that leadership is a choice. As our leaders in Washington confront tough decisions about our budget priorities, I urge them to continue federal funding for public broadcasting. Public broadcasting makes our nation smarter, stronger and, yes, safer. It\u2019s a small public investment that pays huge dividends for Americans. And it shouldn\u2019t be pitted against spending more on improving our military. That\u2019s a false choice.\n\nThis might seem like an unlikely position for me, a 34-year combat veteran. But it\u2019s a view that has been shaped by my career leading brave men and women who thrive and win when they are both strong and smart.

According to the Pew Research Center, rising numbers of American children live with one parent or with two parents who both work.\n\nMy son and daughter-in-law are a two-income family with two children, and day care is a part of their lives. Many other parents must get by without day care services. These parents are busy in the morning and busy at night. They want to protect their children from over-commercialized content. And they strive to prepare their children for school and lifelong learning. Having thoughtful television, games and other media that is not commercially driven is essential to good parenting.\n\nAccording to the Annie E. Casey Foundation, more than half of all kids in our country do not have the opportunity to attend a preschool program. I\u2019ve also seen research that PBS local stations reach more children ages 2 to 5 than any other children\u2019s network, and the new dedicated PBS Kids channel is the only free national programming for children that is available anywhere and anytime.\n\nSign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.

We suspect the poor weather likely exacerbated the pullback, which is consistent with our expectation for a rebound in Q2.\n\nWe have suggested that March jobs report may be subject to mean reversion. After two strong reports, the risk is for slower job growth in March. The increase in weekly jobless claims suggests that as well. Weather may also skew the headline, more for the BLS survey than the ADP estimate.\n\nSome economists have noted that the dollar's reaction function often looks like a smile. It rallies as a haven when there is high anxiety, and it rallies in exceptionally good times, but normal times the dollar suffers. Perhaps that is the sort of response we should look for now. A shockingly poor report will likely be quickly written off as distorted, and there is little chance of a May hike discounted. A very strong report may raise the odds of a June hike (BBG 50.1%, CME 59.1%). Under both extreme scenarios, the dollar could rally. On the other hand, a report in line with expectations may deter a dollar rally.\n\n\n\nThere will be two important aspects of the FOMC minutes that will attract attention. First the Fed will introduce confidence cones around its forecasts. This may help investors have a better appreciation for the forecasts, and surely why they are not point specific promises. Second, the FOMC likely had its first formal discussion of the balance sheet. The key issue for the market is when and how it will be addressed.\n\n\n\nThe modification of the rolling maturing issues into new issues is expected to take place very late this year or early next year. It is not clear whether the Fed will focus on the MBS or Treasury portfolio or both. There are a couple of caveats. These discussions are still early in the process and there will likely be a wide spectrum of views which later will coalesce around two or three. Also, it is important to recognize that the Federal Reserve, especially the Board of Governors will look dramatically different by the middle of next year than it does today. By the end of the month, there will be three vacancies on the seven-person Board. And next year, both the Yellen and Fischer's terms as Chair and Vice are up, and neither is likely to remain a Governor.\n\nThe meeting between the US and Chinese Presidents is at hand. Having seen Chancellor Merkel was treated can only reinforce the cautiousness of President Xi. There is much speculation over the range of issues that could be discussed, though President Trump seemed to play down the trade issue now. The Trump Administration has begun a thorough review of the trade agreements, and it does not seem quite ready to talk specifics.\n\nIt is not clear how China sees Trump. He has backed down on two threats--to cite China as a currency manipulator (on day one) and to abandon the US recognition of only one China. China has made two minor concessions. It will not import coal from North Korea, who apparently launched some a projectile on the day before the meeting between the two presidents. Second, China recently granted Trump more than three dozen commercial trademarks.\n\nIt is not immediately obvious what the US Secretary of State meant when he said that the period of \"strategic patience\" with North Korea is over, or what President Trump had in mind saying that the US did not need China's help with North Korea. Separately, but not totally unrelated, China does not like the missile defense in South Korea.\n\nWe expect some commercial deals to be agreed during Xi's visit. We would not be surprised if the US and China agreed to trade talks, like the ones agreed to with Japan. It is one on this side of\n\nAlice's Looking Glass that the Chinese President may caution the US President against slipping into mercantilism and abandoning free trade principles.\n\nAlthough the euro slipped through $1.0650, it was not sustained, and on Monday and Tuesday, the euro finished near its highs. Barring a surprise, the euro can firm a cent over the next few sessions. The technicals look constructive. The dollar looks better technically against the yen. Buying emerges as JPY110 is approached. Initial resistance is seen near JPY111.20. The $1.2350-$1.2400 may deter a deeper pullback in sterling.\n\nThe dollar-bloc has been heavy, but it too may have found reasonable technical support. The Aussie fell a little through $0.7550 before catching a bid. The $0.7600-$0.7620 could now draw prices. Most of the Tuesday's sell-off in the Canadian dollar took place in Asia and Europe. In North America, the Canadian dollar recovered. A move back to CAD1.33 after turning lower from CAD1.3450 simply return it to where it was before.\n\nThis article was originally published on MarcToMarket.com.",

Even though Al Shabaab still remains a challenge, Mogadishu is far better than it was five years ago. We have been trying to create jobs and attract investments by building roads. For instance, we have completed tarmacking 17 kilometres of roads in the city and are currently working on two more,\" said Mr Jimale.\n\nWith Mogadishu expanding following the expulsion of Al Shabaab from the city in 2011, among the sectors that are still wide open for foreign investments are manufacturing, hospitality, telecommunication, education and insurance.\n\nMr Jimale said that the continued return of Somalis from the diaspora -- who have both capital and skills -- has led to investment in hotels, supermarkets, private universities and hospitals, and boosting the confidence in the city among investors.\n\n\"The collapse of the Siad Barre government in 1991 has cause destruction and affected the minds of the people. This means the city has been starved of services and investments in the past 26 years. I have been trying to win the confidence of Mogadishu residents by persuading them to trust me with their money to invest in services such as roads, education and health. It has taken a while but now they can see the results,\" he said.\n\nJobs, training\n\nMr Jimale said his main challenge is to increase employment opportunities and training for the youth so that they are not susceptible to Al Shabaab ideology.\n\nSo far, he said his administration has 540 youth in the administration with the help of partners such as USAid and the World Bank, who also provide employment opportunities to Mogadishu residents.\n\nThe education sector has huge opportunities for investment given that most public educational institutions were taken over by individuals when the country slipped into anarchy.\n\nMr Jimale said there are currently 50 private universities, and the Mogadishu University opened its doors three years ago after remaining closed for over 20 years.\n\nHowever, he said, his administration's major challenge is that since the country has been in chaos for the past 26 years, some people are holding property belonging to those who fled the country. Returning the property to their rightful owners is a challenge that the mayor's office is currently grappling with.",

Subscribe now for his exclusive untold story \u2014 only in PEOPLE.\n\nLooks like he made it!\n\nAfter 50 years in showbiz, Barry Manilow sat down exclusively with PEOPLE in his home recording studio at his Palm Springs estate to reminisce on his career, enduring legacy and private world ahead of the April 21 release of his latest album, This Is My Town: Songs of New York.\n\nFrom his humble beginnings in Brooklyn and collaborating with Bette Midler to becoming one of the bestselling artists of all time, the pop icon looks back on how he became the man who writes the songs that make the whole world sing.\n\nA Native New Yorker and a Natural Musician\n\nBorn Barry Alan Pincus in 1943, Manilow grew up with his single mom Edna Manilow in Brooklyn\u2019s Williamsburg neighborhood; he took her name after his estranged truck-driver father, Harold Kelliher, left. And while he started playing instruments (accordion at 7, piano at 13), it wasn\u2019t until he met his stepfather Willie Murphy that he found his first love: music.\n\n\u201cWhen my stepfather came into my life and brought with him a stack of albums that may as well have been a stack of gold, some of the greatest music you\u2019ve ever heard \u2014 jazz, Broadway scores, great singers with great arrangements,\u201d recalls Manilow. \u201cHe changed my life with just that little stack of records. My mother was very, very musical. So there was always great music in my house.\u201d\n\nHe wasn\u2019t the most popular teenager \u2014 \u201cI was miserable in high school!\u201d he says with a laugh \u2014 but Manilow found his place among fellow musicians.\n\n\u201cWhen I found the orchestra class, then I became Mr. Popular, really,\u201d says the Eastern District High School alum. \u201cI was voted best musician of the year, I formed my own band \u2026 but before that, I really didn\u2019t know what to do because it was all about sports, and that\u2019s not who I am.\u201d\n\nMarriage, Bette Midler \u2014 and His Big Break\n\nAfter graduating, Manilow married his second love \u2014 high school sweetheart Susan Deixler \u2014 and pursued a career in music in Manhattan. But the young artist\u2019s dreams put a strain on his relationship, and they split after a year.\n\n\u201cI was in love with Susan. I just was not ready for marriage,\u201d says Manilow, who (now married to longtime manager Garry Kief) maintains he wasn\u2019t struggling with his sexuality at the time. \u201cI was out making music every night, sowing my wild oats \u2014 I was too young. I wasn\u2019t ready to settle down.\u201d\n\nBut sacrificing his personal life paid off for his professional one as he worked with up-and-coming singers, accompanying and arranging music for them.\n\nManilow made a name for himself writing jingles (he\u2019s the brain behind such beloved slogans as \u201cLike a good neighbor, State Farm is there\u201d and \u201cI am stuck on Band-Aid brand \u2018cause Band-Aid sticks on me\u201d); headed up music for Ed Sullivan at The Late Show; then, in 1971, began collaborating with one Bette Midler at the gay hotspot the Continental Baths.\n\n\u201cBarry Manilow was a driving force,\u201d says Midler of Manilow, who produced her first two albums. \u201cHe did a great job arranging, and he had a great sense of how to move a song along; he just knew how to inject a song with excitement.\u201d\n\nMidler\u2019s career skyrocketed, and his followed suit.\n\nA Hesitant Superstar\n\nFollowing a lukewarm debut album, Manilow caught the break of a lifetime when famed record exec Clive Davis acquired his contract after seeing him perform for the first time in Central Park.\n\n\u201cI was knocked out,\u201d says Davis, who urged his latest signee to record a rock song that he\u2019d discovered called \u201cBrandy.\u201d So Manilow took the track, slowed it down, and turned it into a dramatic piano ballad and retitling it. Soon after, \u201cMandy\u201d became Manilow\u2019s first No. 1 hit in 1974.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know I was making the first big pop-rock ballad,\u201d says Manilow, laughing. \u201cBut when it did get on the radio, I listened to what was around me: \u2018Kung Fu Fighting,\u2019 \u2018Boogie Oogie Oogie.\u2019 I thought, \u2018These people need me!\u2019\u201d\n\nAlthough he\u2019s beloved by his devoted \u201cFanilows\u201d as a singer, songwriter and performer, Manilow actually prides himself most on his arranging abilities.\n\n\u201cAs an arranger, you take a rock \u2018n\u2019 roll song and make it into a ballad with three chord changes and key changes and an emotional ending. That\u2019s what I do,\u201d he says. \u201cYes, I\u2019m a songwriter. I\u2019ve written a handful of songs that have become hit songs. But that\u2019s not really my forte.\u201d\n\nStill, after the success of \u201cMandy,\u201d Manilow released hit after hit, from \u201cCould It Be Magic\u201d and \u201cLooks Like We Made It\u201d to \u201cCopacabana (At the Copa)\u201d and \u201cCan\u2019t Smile Without You.\u201d\n\n\u201cBarry\u2019s a terrific showman. But he\u2019s so modest about his performing talent and, to some extent, self-deprecating,\u201d says Davis, whose inaugural pre-Grammys party (an award season staple) was thrown in 1976 to celebrate \u201cMandy.\u201d \u201cI mean, the combination of the number of songs that are now part of, clearly, the musical culture? They\u2019re standards. And so the hits that we have enjoyed together are really part of the new Great American Songbook.\u201d\n\nIndeed, Manilow says he\u2019s still wrapping his head around his pop star status.\n\n\u201cI started out not loving the job because it was a big surprise,\u201d he says. \u201cI never thought about being a performer or a singer or any of that \u2014 maybe a composer or producer, anything in the background. But when I wound up on the stage singing and trying to talk to an audience, I was terrible; I was really terrible.\n\n\u201cI was an amateur. I got up from the piano, and I didn\u2019t know what to do with my legs. And as the years went by, I\u2019ve figured it out and become comfortable with it, and the audiences have stayed enthusiastic and wonderful.\u201d\n\n\u2018I\u2019ll Keep Going Until They Stop Me!\u2019\n\nOver the course of his decades-spanning career, Manilow has released dozens of albums, become one of the bestselling artists of all time and won a Grammy, an Emmy (which he uses as a makeshift doorstop!) and a special Tony. And while his fan base is as fervent as ever, he bid adieu to his touring days last year.\n\n\n\n\u201cForty-five years of room service is enough!\u201d Manilow jokes of his retiring from touring. \u201cGoing away from home for weeks at a time, I just couldn\u2019t do that anymore. I wanted to be home, to really have my life back. You know, there\u2019s this joke: Like the prostitute says, it\u2019s not the work, it\u2019s the stares. That\u2019s me! It\u2019s not the work; it\u2019s getting there that got me eventually, it just got me. So it was the last couple of tours I kept saying, \u2018I think this is it.\u2019 And then it wasn\u2019t. It was so exciting: another album, another reason to go on the road, another television thing. But eventually, it just got me, finally.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the end of the road \u2014 but it\u2019s not the end.\u201d\n\nThe consummate performer gets to spend more time with husband Kief at home in Palm Springs these days.\n\n\u201cThe reason I chose Palm Springs: My life is so filled with noise \u2014 great noise and the noise of airports and streets and going in and out of concert halls and music and applause,\u201d he says. \u201cI needed to be able to come home to a place where it was peaceful. It\u2019s peaceful here. It is the absolute opposite of what my 45-year career has been.\u201d\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean Manilow is retiring, though: \u201cI tried it. I was so bored, I was driving myself crazy,\u201d he says.\n\nSure enough, the legend is keeping busy making new music, as This Is My Town drops later this month.\n\nFor more on Barry Manilow and his life, love and legacy, pick up the latest issue of PEOPLE, on newsstands everywhere Friday.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s always the next thing,\u201d he says. \u201cA lot of the people that I started out with are not making albums. There are still record companies that are interested in me and audiences that are still interested in what I have to say. I\u2019m just one of the lucky guys that are able to keep going.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll keep going until they stop me!\u201d",

So he can jump through hoops to prove that he has made improvements and the school is performing well?\n\nWhat the SATs won\u2019t tell you about my son and his education are the times the teachers have gone the extra mile for him.\n\nThe times they have listened to my concerns and acted on them.\n\nOr the teaching assistant who looked after my son when he threw up and passed out at school \u2013 a kindness he has never forgotten.\n\nHis handwriting may be as scruffy as mine but his pictures are incredibly intricate, and he has a creative and eccentric side that many of his teachers have been happy to use to help his learning.\n\nHe has overcome struggles and setbacks, which won\u2019t be articulated in the test.\n\nI could go on.\n\nMy point is, every child has their own unique story of accomplishment, which will not be reflected by the SATs results.\n\nTeachers are no doubt just as stressed out as these will also be a reflection on them.\n\nMost of the time, the tools children need to be able to learn efficiently are way beyond their control.\n\nA good night\u2019s sleep, breakfast, discipline and a good diet are all examples of things that need to be in place long before a child steps inside a school.\n\nCuts to health visitors, children\u2019s centres, and mental health services will no doubt have a big effect in the classroom too.\n\nTeachers will come up against this day in and day out, and the majority will be trying their hardest while facing increasing pressure.\n\nI don\u2019t need a test to tell me how well my child is doing \u2013 we have parents evenings and school reports that do that job already.\n\nSo who do these tests benefit?\n\nSurely there must be a better way of measuring their attainment? And why are we using such old-fashioned methods in a modern world?\n\nIt\u2019s time we stopped wasting teachers\u2019 time on KS2 SATs and let them get on with developing the whole child.\n\nGive children the skills they need to be wonderful, unique young adults who enjoy learning.\n\nLet\u2019s not turn ten and 11-year-olds into stressed robots with the ability to parrot back information for a test that means very little in the long run.\n\nChildren sick of April showers?
