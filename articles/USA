        "Paris Saint-Germain’s Ángel Di María was at his vintage best as he scored twice on his birthday in a 4-0 demolition of Barcelona in their Champions League last 16 first leg. The Argentina winger, 29, scored in each half, with PSG’s Germany midfielder Julian Draxler and the Uruguay striker Edinson Cavani also finding the net as the French champions tore apart a disorganised Barcelona side who have it all to do in the return leg.\n\nPSG, eliminated by Barcelona in the Champions League quarter-finals in 2013 and 2015, were the more aggressive side at the Parc des Princes and have put themselves in a commanding position before the 8 March second leg at the Camp Nou. The five-time European champions Barcelona have not gone out in the last 16 since losing to Liverpool in the 2006‑07 season.\n\nThe only downside for PSG coach Unai Emery was the loss of the impressive Marco Verratti to a leg injury in the second half after a brilliant display from the Italy international and his fellow midfielder Adrien Rabiot in the first half. PSG were dangerous on the break and came close to scoring in the 11th minute when the captain Blaise Matuidi’s rasping shot was parried by Barcelona goalkeeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen after a perfect through ball from Rabiot.\n\nThe home side were rewarded seven minutes later when Di Maria whipped a free kick over the Barcelona wall into the net. Barcelona continued to play their patient possession game but failed to threaten, and their complacency was punished again five minutes before the break. Lionel Messi lost the ball in midfield and Verratti slid a perfectly weighted ball to the right for Draxler, who fired a low shot into the far bottom corner of the net.\n\nPSG started the second half strongly and went further ahead in the 55th minute when Di Maria danced around Andres Iniesta before curling a shot past Ter Stegen from 25 yards. Verratti limped off the pitch in some discomfort after 71 minutes, and was replaced by Chris Nkunku.\n\nPSG continued to push forward, however, and a minute later Cavani, who was celebrating his 30th birthday, rifled a low shot past Ter Stegen for his seventh goal in seven games in the competition this season. The hosts also defended perfectly, with centre back Presnel Kimpembe putting in a superb performance on his Champions League debut in the place of PSG’s injured captain Thiago Silva.\n\nBarcelona had a chance to get an away goal seven minutes from time but Samuel Umtiti’s header hit Kevin Trapp’s right-hand post, leaving Luis Enrique’s side with a mountain to climb. No team have ever overturned a deficit of four or more goals to progress in the Champions league knockout stages.",

        "Harrison Ford was involved in a “potentially serious” incident while piloting his private plane on Monday which is now being investigated by the Federal Aviation Administration, according to a report by NBC Nightly News.\n\nThe actor mistakenly attempted to land on a taxiway at John Wayne Airport in Orange County, which put him near a full passenger plane, according to the report. The FAA told Variety that it does not identify people involved in aircraft incidents or accidents, but issued the following statement on Tuesday:\n\n“Air traffic controllers cleared the pilot of a single-engine Aviat Husky to land on Runway 20L at John Wayne Airport Monday afternoon. The pilot correctly read back the clearance. The pilot then landed on a taxiway that runs parallel to the runway, overflying a Boeing 737 that was holding short of the runway. The FAA is investigating this incident.”\n\nThe passenger plane, American Airlines 737, was reportedly loaded with 110 passengers and a six-person crew. Ford was allegedly heard on an air traffic control recording saying, “Was that airliner meant to be underneath me?” Controllers then apparently informed Ford that he was landing on a taxiway instead of runway 20-L.\n\nFord’s rep declined to comment on the situation on Tuesday.\n\nThe 74-year-old “Star Wars” actor has had decades of flying experience, but has also had a series of crashes and close calls. Most recently, in March 2015, he made an emergency landing in a World War II-era airplane on a Santa Monica golf course after its engine failed.

        "What's better than scoring one goal against Barcelona in the Champions League on your birthday? Bagging a double.\n\nAngel Di Maria scored his second to give PSG a 3-0 lead on Barca in the round of 16 first leg on Tuesday, curling a gorgeous effort into the upper corner. After his free kick made it 1-0, Di Maria outdid himself on his birthday by scoring this beauty.\n\nGame over, possibly the tie. Di Maria with another beautiful goal to make it 3-0!! #PSGFCB ⚽ ... pic.twitter.com/cpfBb9B95v — Ali (@ChocMilkSheikh1) February 14, 2017\n\nAnd that gave the French side a dominant lead against one of the top contenders for the crown. A birthday to remember.", 
        "The Argentine has been a decisive influence at the very top level before, and with Barcelona looming it seems he has rediscovered his motivation\n\nWhen Real Madrid won La Decima in 2014, the influence of Angel Di Maria was hailed as one of the major factors that allowed the Bernabeu side to create history. Named man of the match on the historic occasion they defeated city rivals Atletico, he was not to linger long in Spain, with a British record move to Manchester United following in August.\n\nDi Maria’s spell at Old Trafford, though, was troubled. He never settled under Louis van Gaal, and having been used in a variety of positions was one of the high-profile casualties of what proved to be a thoroughly miserable campaign.\n\n“He is one of the players who are in a row of players who have no self-criticism,” the Dutchman later stated, having been accused by his former charge of moving him around too much.\n\nSeeking gamebreakers to lift them to an elite level, Paris Saint-Germain were quick to pounce for the former Rosario and Benfica man, splashing out £44 million on a player United had paid nearly £60m for 12 months earlier.\n\nAfter making a bright start in France, he has endured a difficult second campaign and is only now beginning to get going again.\n\nA spectacular performance off the bench in Monaco on his PSG debut set the bar high. Given just 24 minutes to impress, he produced one fine assist and showed the kind of silky touches that had ultimately won him acclaim in Spain.\n\nEven if the rest of the season did not live up to that standard, it could be considered relatively strong. No-one could touch him when it came to setting up goals in Ligue 1 – he created 18 in total, five more than his nearest rival and club-mate Zlatan Ibrahimovic. Additionally, he supplied two decisive passes as Chelsea were seen off in the Champions League last 16.\n\nNot necessarily signed as a goal scorer, he would contribute an impressive 15 times on that front.\n\nPSG could have struggled to ask for more as they claimed the domestic treble, with Di Maria performing well in a strong supporting cast around the Swede. This season, however, has been a different story.\n\nWith Ibrahimovic having left for the patch of Manchester that he found impossible win over, the 28-year-old was expected to step forward to become one of the stars of the team. Expectations heightened that he could contribute his regular scoring while maintaining his prolific rate of creating for others.\n\n'I have to score 100 goals before I can go' - Ibrahimovic\n\nUntil the last fortnight, that simply has not been the case.\n\nThe first half of the campaign finished with Di Maria having scored just three goals, including only one in the league, and having created seven more – well down on his pace the previous year. He seemed to be slipping into the void that Zlatan left rather than filling it.\n\nIndeed, it was not until Julian Draxler arrived shortly after Christmas and threatened to take his place that the real Di Maria came to play.\n\nHead coach Unai Emery took the bold step of omitting him from his starting XI under the cover of squad rotation. In reality, it was an admission that Lucas Moura, himself a much-improved figure, and January signing Draxler had overtaken him in the pecking order.\n\nThe German’s arrival in Paris seems to have lit a fire under his rival, which bodes well for the conclusion to the campaign – both at home and abroad.\n\nRonaldinho: PSG can test Barcelona\n\nHaving been alerted to the scale of his problems at PSG, Di Maria is threatening to rediscover the form that made him invaluable to Real Madrid in their clutch moments at the end of 2013-14. He was his side’s best player in the 2-1 win over Lille, and last Friday in Bordeaux, he both scored and created another.\n\nThomas Meunier is clear why there has been a sharp improvement from his South American cohort.\n\n“The competition,” the Belgian explained after the 3-0 success at Stade Matmut Atlantique at the weekend. “Everyone knows that places are expensive, that from one week to the next you could be on the bench or on the field.\n\n“If we want to have a chance to play games, we have to really work at training and in the games, to show we’re capable – and that’s what happened.\n\n“Draxler is a very, very good player, and everyone understands that. Angel, quite simply, he doesn’t want to be a substitute. He’s been metamorphosed. He is just putting a little more in.”\n\nDi Maria, it seems, is starting to show the fight that he was accused of lacking in Manchester, but how long he is prepared to show this level of motivation for is a question that can only be answered by time.\n\nCarlo Ancelotti, the man who, as Madrid boss, saw the best of the player during his blistering spell in the first half of 2014, did not exactly give him a rousing reference when he told Eurosport : \"Some players love to compete, others prefer to make more money. If a player needs motivation to play at the best club in the world, I have no problem in letting him go.\"\n\nNevertheless, the Bayern Munich boss would later praise the player for his unique ability to \"take matches by storm with his energy\". That, however, requires motivation, and that, it seems, it Di Maria's weakness.\n\nIf he is to re-emerge as a star capable of carrying PSG to the very top, as he did with Madrid, Tuesday’s Champions League meeting with Barcelona would be a great place to start - and if he needs any extra incentive to shine upon such a great stage, then his best days really are behind him.",

        "Just your average Joe Trudeau\n\nAnother day, another stumble from White House press secretary Sean Spicer in pronouncing a world leader’s name. After appearing to call Australian PM Malcolm Turnbull “Malcolm Trumble”—twice—Spicer made note of Monday’s much-hyped first meeting between Donald Trump and Justin Trudeau in his briefing, but managed to call Trudeau “Joe.” Perhaps he just hadn’t had his morning cup of Justin yet.\n\nHe says, she says, Flynn goes\n\nMichael Flynn is finally out as national security advisor after misleading White House officials over conversations with Russian officials.

British officials have rejected the proposal, which means—oh yes—Donald J.

Good luck with that.\n\nDown the drain\n\nAfter a decade of legal battles to get his own name trademarked in China—as products from pacemakers to condoms without any affiliation to Trump get produced and sold in the country—Trump appeared in line for a huge victory on Tuesday.

        "What would it take for GM Marc Bergevin to eject coach Michel Therrien from their self-described “foxhole” and change coaches for the Montreal Canadiens?\n\nIt’s something we’ve all pondered, but his loyalty to the coach seemed indissoluble. That is, until Valentine’s Day 2017, when we received our answer:\n\nIt would take Claude Julien being available to replace him.\n\n[Follow Puck Daddy on social media: Twitter | Instagram | Facebook | Tumblr]\n\nThe Canadiens shocked the hockey world and shook up the Eastern Conference on Tuesday by firing Therrien after five seasons and hiring Julien, who was himself fired by the rival Boston Bruins on Feb. 7.\n\nWe all knew he wouldn’t be out of work long. But how many of us actually thought the Canadiens would drop the hammer on Therrien to hire Julien for his second stint with the Habs?\n\nFrom the team:\n\n“I would like to sincerely thank Michel for his relentless work with the Montreal Canadiens over his eight seasons behind the bench, including the last five seasons when we worked together. The decision to remove Michel from his coaching duties was a difficult one because I have lots of respect for him. I came to the conclusion that our team needed a new energy, a new voice, a new direction. Claude Julien is an experienced and well respected coach with a good knowledge of the Montreal market. Claude has been very successful as an NHL coach and he won the Stanley Cup. Today we hired the best available coach, and one of the league’s best. I am convinced that he has the capabilities to get our team back on the winning track,” said Canadiens general manager, Marc Bergevin.\n\nClaude Julien, 56, enters his second tour of duty as head coach of the Montreal Canadiens after assuming the role of head coach from January 2003 to January 2006 with a record of 72-62-10-15 in 259 regular season games at the helm of the team (holding a .531 winning percentage). Claude Julien has coached 997 regular season games in the NHL (Montreal, New Jersey and Boston), including the last 10 season as the Bruins bench boss (2007 to 2017). Throughout his NHL career, Julien managed a record of 538 wins, 332 losses, 10 ties and 117 overtime losses for a .603 winning percentage.\n\nJulien was relieved of his coaching duties with the Boston Bruins on February 7 after compiling a record of 419-246-94 in 759 regular season games, and a .614 winning percentage behind the Bruins bench. He led his team to the Stanley Cup Championship in 2011 and also reached the NHL Stanley Cup finals in 2013. He also led the Bruins to the President’s Trophy in 2013-14 after racking up 117 points in the standings. In 2008-09, Julien was the Jack Adams Trophy recipient as the NHL’s head coach of the year and, on March 7, 2016 he reached yet another milestone when he became the winningest coach in Bruins history with 388 wins. Julien, who earned his 500th NHL win on February 13, 2016, also holds the Bruins record for most playoff wins with 57.\n\nWith a career 997 games, Julien ranks 27th among NHL head coaches (11th among active head coaches) and 21st with 538 wins (10th among active head coaches). A native of Orleans, Ontario, Julien began his coaching career behind the bench of the Hull Olympiques in the QMJHL back in 1996. Compiling a record of 141-109-16 in four seasons in Hull, he led his team to the Memorial Cup in 1997. Julien also led the Hamilton Bulldogs from 2000 to 2003, earning a selection of AHL coach of the year in 2002-03. On the international stage, as a member of Team Canada’s coaching staff, he won gold at the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics and captured yet another gold medal at the 2016 World Cup of Hockey.\n\nJulien inherits a Canadiens team that has been trending downward from its torrid start. The Habs are 31-19-8 for 70 points, but the second-place Ottawa Senators trail them by six points and have five games in-hand. After a 13-1-1 start, the Canadiens have gone 18-18-7.\n\nThe first real sign that Therrien could be in trouble came two days after Julien was fired, when Bergevin held a meeting with Max Pacioretty, Carey Price and Shea Weber without Therrien present.\n\nFive days later, Claude Julien is their new head coach.\n\n[Newsletter: Get 5 great stories from the Yahoo Sports blogs in your inbox every morning!]\n\nRead More", 
        "I don’t know if Bruce Cassidy is the second coming of Scotty Bowman. I’m not even sure he is as good a head coach as Claude Julien was.\n\nBut what’s clear is that the Boston Bruins, who are 3-0-0 since changing coaches last week, are benefitting from having a new voice behind the bench. And they aren’t the only ones. From the St. Louis Blues to the New York Islanders, the best trades in the NHL this season have concerned a coach, not a player.\n\nIt’s called a bump, a boost or a boon. And while there is no guarantee that this short-term surge will continue for the long run, it quite possibly has saved Boston’s season. And a similar move could save Montreal’s season as well.\n\nThe Habs, who lost 4-0 to the Bruins on Sunday, still have a six-point lead atop the Atlantic Division. But after losing 10 of their past 13 games, they head into the bye week skidding toward the same proverbial cliff that the team fell off last year.\n\nMaybe the five-day break will give the team a chance to clear its collective head and get back on track. Maybe acquiring a player such as Matt Duchene at the upcoming March 1 trade deadline will make things right. But that’s nearly three weeks away.\n\nBy then, the Habs, who have played five more games than the second-place Senators and have four games in hand on the fourth-place Leafs in the Atlantic Division standings, could be out of a playoff spot.\n\nBesides, the Habs don’t really need to make a trade. They just need a jolt in the same way that the Bruins, Blues and Islanders needed one.\n\nIn other words, they need to fire head coach Michel Therrien.\n\nWhen the Blues fired Ken Hitchcock on Feb. 1, the team had lost five of its past six games and was clinging to the final wild-card spot. Today, they are 5-1-0 under Mike Yeo and in third place in the Central Division. The Islanders are 7-2-2 since firing Jack Capuano, having climbed from last in the Eastern Conference to 10th place, just three points out of the wild-card spot.\n\nEven the Florida Panthers, who fired Gerard Gallant in November, have shown a slight improvement since then.\n\nIt’s not about Xs and Os. A new coach might assign new roles to players and devise different power-play schemes. But, mostly, it’s a wakeup call to the rest of the team. Trades are harder and harder to execute in today’s NHL, but firing the head coach is an easy way for a GM to get the message across that things need to change.\n\nAfter that, it’s up to the players.\n\n“It’s been pretty impressive,” Blues defenceman Colton Parayko told reporters after winning their fourth straight game under Yeo. “We’ve just realized that if we want to do this, we’ve got to put together the effort and make sure that we work together as a team. We definitely have the team on paper to be one of the best in the league, so it’s just a matter of showing up and working together. It’s definitely an exciting time for us when we know what we can be like when we play our best.”\n\nA year ago, the Pittsburgh Penguins found themselves at a similar crossroads when they fired Mike Johnston and replaced him with Mike Sullivan. At the time, the team was 15-10-3 and in fifth place in the crowded Metropolitan Division. The move ended up not only saving their season, but also resulted in a Stanley Cup championship. In the past eight years, two other coaches — Darryl Sutter and Dan Bylsma — have taken over a team in the middle of the season and won a Cup.\n\nThere is no reason why the Canadiens couldn't pull a similar 180 with another voice behind the bench. They have the best goalie in the league in Carey Price, a defenceman in Shea Weber who is in the Norris Trophy conversation and a top scorer in Max Pacioretty who is two goals back of Sidney Crosby in the Rocket Richard Trophy race.\n\nYet the Canadiens are a mess.\n\nThe team, which went 13-1-1 to start the season, has the worst record in the NHL since the beginning of February. Price hasn’t been nearly as sharp as he was at the beginning of the season, but it’s hard to blame the goaltending when Montreal has been shut out in three of its past five games and is averaging two goals per game in the past month.\n\nWith Alex Galchenyuk and Brendan Gallagher both healthy, there are no excuses. The Canadiens, who have another year after this one before Price becomes an unrestricted free agent, need to take advantage of this window before it starts closing and rebuilding teams such as Toronto and Buffalo become even more competitive.\n\nMontreal already made a culture-shifting move last summer, when GM Marc Bergevin traded P.K. Subban to Nashville for Weber.\n\nNow another move is needed.\n\nmtraikos@postmedia.com",

        "By Amanda Wicks\n\nIn a comment that’s sure to bring a massive attack from the BeyHive, Carlos Santana has offered his opinion about why Adele won Album of the Year at the 59th Annual GRAMMY Awards. According to him, Beyoncé isn’t a “real” singer.\n\nRelated: Santana Apology Unlikely to Sway Beyhive\n\n“I think that Adele won because she can sing, sing,” Santana told the Australian Associated Press (via New Zealand Herald).\n\nTo make matters worse, he also tried to qualify the difference between Adele’s talent and Beyoncé’s. “With all respect to our sister Beyoncé,” he said, “Beyoncé is very beautiful to look at and it’s more like modeling kind of music—music to model a dress—she’s not a singer, singer, with all respect to her.”\n\nSantana performed with Beyonce at the pre-game festivities before the Super Bowl in 2003.\n\nFor her part, Adele thought the Album of the Year award should’ve gone to Beyoncé for Lemonade. She even spent a good part of her acceptance speech talking about how much Beyoncé had influenced her own music and career.", 
        "Carlos Santana: Beyonce Is a Model, Adele Is a Singer\n\nWas Beyonce really robbed at the Grammys? Maybe the judges got this one right.\n\nAdele won an astounding five Grammy Awards on Sunday night, with Beyonce considered the big loser. Critics blasted Grammy judges for dismissing Beyonce’s album Lemonade, and even Adele paid tribute to the singer while accepting her award.\n\nBut is Beyonce really a singer? Or just a model and entertainer?\n\nNow, 13-time Grammys winner Carlos Santana says this all boils down to raw musical talent. And when it comes to actual singing, Adele is in a totally different league. “I think that Adele won because she can sing, sing,” Santana told the Australian Associated Press this morning.\n\n“With all respect to our sister Beyonce, Beyonce is very beautiful to look at and it’s more like modelling kind of music – music to model a dress – she’s not a singer, singer, with all respect to her.”\n\n+ Grammys 2017: The Complete Winners List\n\nThe blunt comment comes from one of the greatest guitarists of all time. And, a Grammy winning musician whose career has spanned decades, both as a soloist and member of his self-named group, Santana. That certainly gives him credentials to comment, though the line between ‘entertainer’ and ‘musician’ is often debated.\n\n+ Are the Grammys Racist and Outdated? Macklemore the Latest to Protest\n\nMeanwhile, the Grammys are getting slammed with accusations of racism, largely over the ‘Beyonce snub’. That resembles earlier charges against the Oscars, though the latest charges may be misplaced. Among the big winners at Sunday’s awards ceremony was Chance the Rapper, who won Best New Artist.\n\nThat said, major artists were missing. Ahead of the ceremony, marquee talent like Frank Ocean, Drake, Justin Bieber and Macklemore opted against participating. In the case of Frank Ocean, the absence was part of a protest against a ‘racist’ and ‘outdated’ event.\n\nThat said, the 59th Grammys hardly seemed like a racist affair. Through the evening, a multi-racial group of artists performed, with messages of unity and inclusion. That boiled over in a rap performance that included Busta Rhymes, who publicly attacked ‘President Agent Orange’ and specifically his immigration bans.\n\nFor the record, Beyonce did claim an award for Best Urban Contemporary Album.",

        "As the Champions League returns, let us consider one of elite European football's most persistent mysteries. More appalling than The Dabgrave Ritual, more controversial than The Salto Vampire. We refer, of course, to the Adventure of the Two Strikers.\n\nOver the last few years, in Paris, two forwards have been playing their trade. One is, frankly, a buffoon. He clanks around up front like a man who grew up believing that football was a game about missing the goal, has only just been informed of his mistake, and is losing the battle against his ingrained instincts. Sometimes the ball goes in, generally out of embarrassment. Mostly, he just looks confused, while his teammates shake their heads, the game slips away, and the word \"fraud\" gallops around the internet.\n\nThe other is pretty much a case study in how to do one's job. Whether we simply count his goals, or look to the more complex metrics such as xG (R^E, L7, eN variant)*, we find the same results. When played in his right position with decent support, he gets on the end of plenty of chances and he puts an acceptable proportion of them away. In short, he is extremely unfraudulent.\n\n* Expected goals, adjusted for the rotation of the earth, the moon's presence in the seventh house, and El Niño.\n\nThe mystery is that both these players play for Paris Saint-Germain in the same position, at the same time, wearing the same numbered shirt and the same face. And are the same person: Edinson Cavani.\n\nThe internet isn't big enough to get to the bottom of the argument between those people who like to watch football with their eyes, and those people who distrust their lying eyes and like to watch football with their spreadsheets. But there are few footballers for whom the fraud/non-fraud argument is felt quite so sharply. And, as PSG's owners pursue the Champions League trophy that would validate their entire project, there are few for whom it's so important.\n\nLast November's Champions League game against Arsenal provided the perfect illustration of the problem. It is deeply unfortunate that a striker gets remembered for his misses in a game where he scored the opening goal, one that ultimately made the difference between a draw and a defeat. But Cavani missed four clear chances that night and, come the end of the group stage, PSG finished two points behind Arsenal. That's why they've landed Barcelona in the knockout stages; that's why Cavani will likely have to score plenty over the two legs.\n\n(The fact that Arsenal went on to draw Bayern Munich is irrelevant here, because when it comes to Champions League knockout draws Arsenal are cursed, whereas PSG are simply unlucky.)\n\nWhat makes the suggestions of fraudulence even sharper is the fact that Cavani, for a given value of perfect, looks perfect. Long hair, broad shoulders, cheekbones that should probably be illegal: He looks like an attempt to construct a footballing superhero from the ground up. \"Give me a brilliant, charismatic, intimidating striker who could also kill an elephant if he absolutely had to.\" So when this vision of footballing perfection misses a chance? It looks unshakably wrong.\n\nPerhaps this is where we can find the solution to our mystery. Cavani's heroic aspect comes with certain responsibilities. Strikers in his mold should express themselves through their shoulders, their sinews, and their sweat. They should howitzer their goals into the net from about 20 yards out, then whip their hair around and scream for the replays. Not all footballers can be Gabriel Batistuta; even the great man himself resorted to the occasional toe poke. But those that have the look simply must give it a go.\n\nThe fraud committed by Cavani isn't the usual combination of being (a) famous, (b) expensive, and (c) extremely well-paid while also being (d) secretly rubbish. Instead, it's one of presentation, of expectations. Though he has his spectacular moments, he spends most of his time playing a game antithetical to his bearing. He gets into clever positions, he moves intelligently off the ball, he peels away from defenders. All good stuff, all admirable. But all somehow inappropriate, from a man whose bearing promises to take on and overcome the laws of physics.\n\nSometimes he tucks away his chances, sometimes he doesn't. Either way, we the viewers are largely left bereft. Yet ultimately, he's the real victim here, the butt of some great cosmic joke. They took a striker who looks like the lovechild of Batistuta and Conan The Barbarian, and they made him play like Andy Cole. No wonder people get so angry.",

Neither team will win the Champions League, but...\n\n...the winner of the tie will certainly cause problems for whoever they face in the quarter-finals.\n\nThe pace was frantic in the early stages and both sides caused problems for each other with nippy runs between the defenders.\n\nNelson Semedo and Eduardo Silva looked a deadly partnership down the right for Benfica, while Dortmund's creative forward line of Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, Marco Reus, Ousmane Dembele and Raphael Guerreiro look capable of changing a game at any moment.\n\nYou do feel that both sides are missing a little bit of star quality to go all the way - but they can most definitely scare one of the big guns.\n\n(Photo: Lars Baron)\n\n2. Aubameyang firing blanks\n\nHe might be one of the most sought-after strikers in the world, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang looked a man devoid of confidence.\n\nDortmund came into the fixture after only winning two of their previous eight games, with their talismanic striker only scoring twice since the start of December.\n\nHe had the perfect chance to return to form when Ousmane Dembele played him one-on-one in the first-half, only to rocket the ball over the crossbar. He then had the opportunity to tap into an open net, but he was a yard short of latching onto the cutback.\n\n(Photo: Lars Baron)\n\nAnd at the start of the second period, he lifted another one-on-one over the crossbar.\n\nWhat did he possibly need for a confidence boost? A penalty, of course. He missed that too. Straight down the middle but Ederson saw it coming and stayed put.\n\nHe was substituted off in the 62nd minute to compound the misery on a night to forget.\n\n(Photo: Alexandre Simoes)\n\n3. Fifth officials under fire again\n\nWe all know the phrase 'too many cooks spoil the broth'.\n\nWell, perhaps this was the problem when the fifth official, situated on the goal line, failed to collaborate with the referee and the linesman to give the most simple foul of the night.\n\nOusmane Dembele charged through on goal and Benfica goalkeeper Ederson raced out, only for his attempted clearance of the ball to completely miss, resulting in him wiping out the Frenchman on the edge of the box.\n\nThe official behind the goal was about 15 yards from the incident, a similar position to the linesman. Whose call should it be? Either way, Benfica got away with one.\n\n(Photo: Lars Baron)\n\n4. Remember Fulham's Mitroglou? He's pretty good now\n\nLet's all be perfectly honest, here. Kostas Mitroglou was bloomin' awful during his time at Fulham.\n\nHe is considered by most as one of the biggest flops in the history of the January transfer window, with the Cottagers paying a club-record £12million for his services. They didn't get a single goal from him.\n\nSo looking at the 28-year-old now, you would barely believe that it is the same man banging them in for Benfica in the Champions League.\n\nA smart run, bags of composure and a deft touch saw him open the scoring for the hosts.\n\nEven more remarkably, it was his 13th goal in his last 13 matches. Not too shabby.\n\n(Photo: Lars Baron)\n\n5. Wigan are setting their sights high\n\nYes, Wigan Athletic. Our Wigan. The pie-lovers from the outskirts of Greater Manchester.\n\nThe scout list from Estadio da Luz had a few interesting names on it. As expected, the likes of Manchester United, Chelsea, Juventus and Bayern Munich were included... as were Wigan Athletic.\n\nWhile staring relegation from the Championship in the face, you have to question which players they are possibly looking at in a Champions League fixture.\n\nAnother interesting note from the list is that United legend Ryan Giggs is down as UEFA's technical observer. Looks like he's found himself a temporary role before his first managerial venture.",

        "Andre Gomes says his playing style is a mix of Andres Iniesta and Ivan Rakitic\n\nThe 23-year-old joined Barcelona from Valencia last summer\n\nby Rohit Viswanathan News 14 Feb 2017, 16:47 IST\n\nGomes celebrates with Neymar and Messi\n\nWhat’s the story?\n\nAndre Gomes has had a stop-start season so far for Barcelona and is still getting used to playing at the tempo of his teammates but there is definitely an improvement in his game. With Andres Iniesta getting older and Rakitic’s future still in doubt, this season is make or break as far as Gomes’s Barcelona career is concerned\n\nBut Gomes believes he is always learning and has a unique playing style as well. Asked in detail about who he feels he is most similar to he said, “I prefer to have my own style... I think I’m a mix of the two [Iniesta and Rakitic]. No one is the same as either of them. They’re two great players.”\n\nThe midfielder might be currently on a learning curve but Barcelona will be hoping he can fulfil his potential.\n\nIn case you didn’t know..\n\nAndre Gomes despite being Portuguese, chose to play for Barcelona knowing his countryman Cristiano Ronaldo is at Real Madrid. The midfielder played for Valencia last season and was exceptional in the centre of the park.\n\nHe lifted the Euro 2016 in the summer before completing his move to Catalunya.\n\nThe heart of the matter\n\nGomes has been rotating with Dennis Suarez in that midfield and has also played across the three positions in the centre of the park. When Busquets was out injured he filled in for his teammate.\n\nHe has already played in Rakitic’s role, as well as in a more advanced position where Iniesta usually plays. It seems his versatility is his strength and Barcelona have utilized it well this season but that might have been the reason for his average showings so far.\n\nGomes has struggled for consistency this campaign and needs to be given a more definite role in the first team. Shifting him around might be affecting his game but by his own admission, he is determined to be successful as a versatile playmaker.\n\nAlso Read: Valencia director Jesus Garcia Pitarch reveals Real Madrid almost signed Andre Gomes\n\nWhat’s next?\n\nWith Busquets returning and Iniesta also back to full fitness, he might find his chances once again limited. The Catalans will take on PSG tonight in the UEFA Champions League and it will be a very tough task for them despite being favourites.\n\nSportskeeda’s take\n\nThe next two months will be crucial for Gomes. He was Barcelona’s biggest signing of the summer which puts him under more pressure to perform. His recent performances have been encouraging and Luis Enrique will be hoping for more from the same.", 
        "Barcelona certainly made tough work of their Copa del Rey semi-final second leg clash against Atletico Madrid.\n\nHeading into the game at the Camp Nou, Luis Enrique's men held a slender 2-1 lead from their previous meeting and would have felt extremely confident of reaching the final.\n\nHowever, Atletico gave the Catalans a huge scare in the second half and very nearly pulled off a big upset.\n\nArticle continues below\n\nLuis Suarez had extended Barca's aggregate lead with a close-range strike in the first half but Sergi Roberto's red card early in the second period prompted a crazy finish to the game.\n\nAtletico's Yannick Carrasco joined Roberto in the changing room little over 10 minutes later after picking up a second yellow.\n\nArticle continues below\n\nThen substitute Kevin Gameiro missed from the penalty spot, only to make amends by scoring almost immediately afterwards.\n\nSuarez then picked up the third red card of the evening for a controversial second booking to leave the hosts with nine men for the closing stages.\n\nAnd they clung on, just.\n\nIn amongst all of the drama was an assured performance from Andre Gomes.\n\nIniesta and Sergio Busquets began the night on the bench, giving Gomes the responsibility to link up play between the midfield and strikers.\n\nAnd while on the whole he impressed, there was one particular moment which really caught our eye.\n\nWith two Atletico players charging in to nick the ball from the Portuguese just inside his own half, Gomes produced a quite brilliant turn to leave them stranded - see the video below.\n\nOne of the chasing pack, Griezmann, was left flat on his backside as Gomes wheeled away before spreading the play to Arda Turan on the left.\n\nAfter overcoming a stubborn Atletico side, Barcelona's reward will come in the form of a tie against either Celta Vigo or Alaves in the final.\n\nDo YOU want to write for GiveMeSport?
