        "body0": "It\u2019s becoming commonplace for Chicago sports teams to break historic droughts, and Northwestern University joined that growing list when they were selected to their first NCAA tournament berth in school history. (Published Wednesday, March 15, 2017)\n\nThursday is a day that all Northwestern University fans have been waiting for, as the Wildcats will open NCAA tournament play with a tough contest against Vanderbilt.\n\nThe Wildcats, who will be making their first ever appearance in the tournament, are considered to be slight favorites in the battle between the eighth and ninth seeds in the West Regional, but after an up-and-down regular season, the Wildcats are still poised for a fight against the Commodores.\n\nBryant McIntosh will be looking to rebound for Northwestern after a pedestrian game against Wisconsin in the Big Ten tournament, as the junior guard managed just eight points on 4-of-12 shooting in the team\u2019s 76-48 loss. The game broke McIntosh\u2019s streak of seven straight games of scoring in double figures, and it was also his worst shooting performance since mid-February.\n\nThe Wildcats will also need sophomore standout Vic Law to get his scoring touch back, as he\u2019s had an inconsistent run of late. He played very well in wins over Rutgers and Maryland in the Big Ten tournament, scoring 16 and 17 points in those games respectively, but he crashed back down to Earth against Wisconsin as he, like so many of his teammates, struggled from the field as he managed just four points in the blowout loss.\n\nAside from getting production from some of their top scorers, the Wildcats will need to take care of the basketball, and that\u2019s something they\u2019ve been very good at this season. Northwestern has averaged 10.5 turnovers per game according to ESPN, and that is good enough to rank them 16th in the nation in that category.\n\nTaking care of the ball takes some pressure off of the Wildcats\u2019 defense, and they are a fairly stout group in that department as well, as they\u2019ve held opponents to fewer than 70 points in nine of their last 11 games heading into the tournament.\n\nAs for Vanderbilt, they are a battle-tested group that has played the toughest schedule in the nation. That accounts for their entry into the tournament despite having 15 regular season losses (the most that any at-large team has ever had), and it\u2019s given them plenty of experience in terms of facing adversity.\n\nThe Commodores won seven of their last nine games heading into the tournament, including two wins over number-four seeded Florida and a road win over Tennessee.\n\nTip-off is scheduled for 3:30 p.m. Central time, and the game will be televised on TBS as part of the network\u2019s March Madness coverage.",

She has become a regular at Northwestern games during its run to the program\u2019s first ever NCAA tournament bid.\n\nWhen the Wildcats hit that touchdown pass game winner, Louis-Dreyfus was there. It\u2019s all because her son Charlie Hall is on the team.\n\nHall is a sophomore walk-on at Northwestern. While he doesn\u2019t get much time on the court, Louis-Dreyfus is there to cheer her son on regardless.\n\nESPN2 caught Julia Louis-Dreyfus (@OfficialJLD) celebrating a rebound by her son, @NUMensBball sophomore @charlie_hall23. pic.twitter.com/xgbBwrWGQm \u2014 Jeff Eisenband (@JeffEisenband) March 10, 2017\n\nRelated Vanderbilt blew a late lead over Northwestern with a totally baffling foul\n\nBoth Louis-Dreyfus and her husband Brad Hall are Northwestern grads.\n\nAccording to the Chicago Tribune, Hall doesn\u2019t get recognized much for being Louis-Dreyfus\u2019 son but that doesn\u2019t mean he lacks the comedic chops.

        "body1": "Insider\n\nWe continue our recruit and return series with the Vanderbilt Commodores, whose season ended Thursday with a loss to Northwestern in the West Region. Here is a look at what the 2017-18 season could hold:\n\nPossible 2017-18 starting five:\n\nG: Riley LaChance\n\nG: Matthew Fisher-Davis\n\nG: Joe Toye\n\nF: Jeff Roberson\n\nF: Clevon Brown\n\nWho is lost: Part of the reason Vanderbilt was so difficult to defend this past season was the presence of Luke Kornet on the offensive end. At 7-foot-1, Kornet was one of the best 3-point shooters on the team and really spread out the defense. With Kornet graduating, Bryce Drew won\u2019t have a tailor-made replacement, and Kornet\u2019s ability to stretch the floor will be missed. Former Cornell transfer Nolan Cressler is also gone after shooting 43 percent from 3-point range the past season. He brought versatility to the Commodores\u2019 perimeter group.\n\nWho is added: Drew\u2019s first recruiting class will fill some voids in Nashville. The highest-rated prospect is four-star center Ejike Obinna, who will help replace Kornet -- but is completely different. Obinna is athletic and will help immediately on the defensive end of the floor, potentially changing the look of Vanderbilt\u2019s frontcourt. A pair of three-star point guards also enter the program in Saban Lee and Maxwell Evans. Lee in particular could be an immediate impact player. He\u2019s long and athletic and loves to push the tempo. He could allow LaChance to move off the ball for stretches. Larry Austin Jr., a transfer from Xavier, is eligible next season.\n\nWhat it means for next season: Drew has five of his top seven back from this season. Matthew Fisher-Davis and LaChance both averaged in double figures and are two of the best shooters in the SEC. Fisher-Davis led the team in scoring, despite a late-season slump. LaChance is one of the best shooters in the country, burying nearly 50 percent of his shots from behind the arc while distributing effectively. The addition of some ball-handlers in the recruiting class will certainly help. Jeff Roberson is an inside-outside weapon up front. His shooting from 3-point range dropped off as a junior, but he improved his rebounding and ability to score in the paint. Chicago native Joe Toye saw a major bump in minutes late in the season and established himself as a key shooter and versatile defender. Expect Clevon Brown to see more time down low next season. Payton Willis is a versatile perimeter weapon.\n\nTrending: Level. Drew got Vanderbilt to the NCAA tournament in his first season at the helm, and there will be an influx of talent into the program. The loss of Kornet will hurt, though, and remember: This team lost 15 games before the NCAA tournament.",

Speed. A sideline-to-sideline player. And that\u2019s something that has helped me. That and my instincts has helped me to be a good player.\u201d\n\nThe Dolphins have secured a durable veteran middle linebacker, Lawrence Timmons, in free agency. This will likely allow Miami to move productive linebacker Kiko Alonso outside.\n\nKoa Misi\u2019s health is a concern. Jelani Jenkins seems unlikely to return. And Neville Hewitt is a promising developmental player.\n\nCunningham has the capability of playing outside or inside linebacker, but could potentially join Timmons and Alonso to create a much-improved linebacker unit.\n\nCunningham had 16.5 tackles for loss last season, a statistic coach Adam Gase and defensive coordinator Matt Burke will surely note.\n\nAnd the film shows he can also effectively cover linebackers and running backs.\n\n\u201cI feel I am one of the better linebackers as far as pass coverage goes,\u201d Cunningham said.\n\nAccording to a scouting report by NFL.com, Cunningham is a \u201cplay-making machine,\u201d \u201cplays on a downhill tilt and is always looking to draw first blood,\u201d \u201ccreates tackles for losses by shooting gaps at appropriate angles,\u201d is a \u201cfootball magnet with outstanding tackle production and ability to create and recover turnovers\u201d and is \u201cdurable and reliable.\u201d\n\nPro Football Focus labeled Cunningham \u201cthe best linebacker you\u2019ve never heard of.\u201d\n\nBut that article was published before last season.\n\nAccording to PFF, Cunningham grades well against the run, in coverage and as a pass-rusher. The scouts at PFF cite Cunningham\u2019s speed, physicality, and understanding of the game.\n\nVanderbilt coach Derek Mason has said Cunningham is one of those players who can translate football \u201cfrom the class to the grass.\u201d\n\nSome have compared Cunningham to Chiefs linebacker Derrick Johnson, Browns linebacker Jamie Collins or Rams linebacker Alec Ogletree.\n\n#Dolphins have spent time with S Jabril Peppers, LB Hasson Reddick, LB Zach Cunningham, DE Taco Charlton. #DraftTalk \u2014 Draft Talk (@Draft_Talk_NFL) March 13, 2017\n\nCunningham says he is a team player. He proudly describes the enjoyment he took from playing guitar in a band.\n\n\u201cIt all ties together in being in a group,\u201d Cunningham said. \u201cBeing a part of a big family. Something that everyone is really aimed at achieving something that\u2019s bigger than themselves, for the group as a whole. And that\u2019s something that definitely relates to football.\u201d\n\nCunningham is a fan of John Legend. He says he\u2019d get together with some of his Vanderbilt teammates and have some R&B or Jazz \u201cjam sessions.\u201d\n\nBut Cunningham wants to leave no doubt his first love is football. It\u2019s important to him. He\u2019s driven to put the notion of being overlooked behind him.\n\n\u201cI have a great work ethic,\u201d Cunningham said. \u201cPassion for the game. Passion for what I do. A hard player. A team player. Always putting the team first. I\u2019m a guy that\u2019s going to sell himself out for his teammates as much as my teammates would sell themselves out for me.\u201d\n\nWonder what Jordan Phillips thinks of Dontari Poe Miami Dolphins visit\n\nNo, at $20 million, Miami Dolphins QB Ryan Tannehill isn\u2019t overpaid\n\nHow the Miami Dolphins compare to New England Patriots, at the moment\n\nBefore blasting an NFL contract as \u2018ridiculous!\u2019 consider Isa Abdul-Quddus\n\nLOOK: What if you could get Dolphins stories right to your Facebook by liking this page"

        "body0": "Doug Collins was the epitome of a proud father on Thursday afternoon as his son Chris led Northwestern to their first-ever NCAA Tournament win\n\nThe Northwestern Wildcats made some history this past Sunday when they earned their first-ever selection into the NCAA Tournament. On Thursday, they took that history a bit further, as they ended up winning their first-ever NCAA Tournament game, a nail-biter over Vanderbilt. It was truly a milestone moment for head coach Chris Collins and the Wildcats program.\n\nBut during the final stretch of the game as Northwestern was coming away with the win, the focus for just a short while was on another Collins \u2014 Chris\u2019 father Doug. Doug has seen his son through this entire journey, and you had to imagine that he was the proudest father in the world during that moment when the realization set in that the win was coming.\n\nOh he indeed was the proudest father in the world, and it showed on his face, as the television cameras were able to catch.\n\nDoug Collins can\u2019t even\u2026 pic.twitter.com/GOBq4JnGBm \u2014 Bleacher Report (@BleacherReport) March 16, 2017\n\n\n\nYep, that\u2019s certainly a proud father if there ever was one, and it\u2019s pretty obvious that he has every right in the world to be.\n\nRELATED: Updated 2017 NCAA Tournament bracket\n\nDoug has already made his mark on the basketball world as a player and a coach, and now he is watching his son make some history of his own. And what may be the best part of all this is the fact that Collins might just be getting started with the work he\u2019s doing with this Northwestern program. Much more may be to come, especially in this tournament alone as the Wildcats are now advancing on.\n\nBut there might not be much for Doug that will be better than seeing his son make history such as he and his team did on Thursday afternoon.", 
        "body2": "On the day Northwestern introduced basketball coach Chris Collins on April 2, 2013, with Welsh-Ryan Arena filled with blind faith more than the fervor on hand Sunday, his father, Doug, pondered the future from his front-row seat.\n\n\"There is something to being the first,\" Doug Collins said, explaining what drew Chris to Evanston after 13 years as a Duke assistant. \"Do you want to chase somebody's legacy or create your own?\"\n\nBut was his son up to the task?\n\nThe answer came emphatically Sunday when Chris Collins became the only Northwestern coach to qualify for the NCAA tournament, ending a 78-year period of futility that made the Wildcats a favorite of Cubs fans familiar with the concept of waiting. Now the Wildcats will try not to suck Thursday afternoon in Salt Lake City against beatable Vanderbilt and extend one of the happiest endings in sports at least another 40 minutes.\n\nGood luck finding a more compelling story in the 68-team field than the last Power Five program to qualify for the tourney, leaving only Army, Citadel, William and Mary and St. Francis (N.Y.) among the original 160 Division I schools that never have celebrated on Selection Sunday. This week, America's team wears purple.\n\nAs you will hear all week until tipoff, no matter what happens against the Commodores, Northwestern's 2016-17 season will go down as a success. In terms of recruiting and tradition, the Wildcats could lose by 20 Thursday without feeling a ripple. Nobody can argue.\n\nBut face it: As well as Northwestern played at the Big Ten tournament until running out of gas Saturday against Wisconsin, the Wildcats have to believe they can handle a Vanderbilt team with 15 losses. Bryant McIntosh and Scottie Lindsey and Vic Law can arrive with the swagger they've developed under Collins. No matter how many years the Northwestern program has gone without participating in March Madness, nobody should be satisfied with going 23-11, beating five NCAA teams and becoming the tournament darling.\n\nChris Collins on Northwestern's first-ever NCAA tournament selection Northwestern coach Chris Collins reacts after it was announced the team was selected into its first-ever NCAA tournament on March 12, 2017. (Teddy Greenstein/Chicago Tribune) Northwestern coach Chris Collins reacts after it was announced the team was selected into its first-ever NCAA tournament on March 12, 2017. (Teddy Greenstein/Chicago Tribune) See more videos\n\nPerhaps nobody expects Northwestern to beat the West's No. 1 seed, Gonzaga, in the second round, but if the program has matured to the point Collins thinks, the Wildcats should approach the Vanderbilt game as a referendum on their season. Worry about rationalizing the loss later. Act like defeat isn't an option now. In one of the dozens of interviews Collins conducted Sunday, the giddy coach summed it up well, like a guy who had been rehearsing answers all week in front of a mirror.\n\n\"You want to go to the dance, but you want to dance a few songs and not just leave after the first number,\" Collins said.\n\nEncore, encore.\n\nIronically, Northwestern will play under the same roof where the last Chicago-area basketball moment carried a national impact. On June 14, 1998, Michael Jordan held the follow-through against Bryon Russell to lead the Bulls past the Jazz in Game 6 for their last NBA title in what was then the Delta Center and has since been renamed the Vivint Smart Home Arena. Almost 19 years later, the time has come for another group of basketball players visiting Utah from Cook County, Ill., to do something in the building that's never been done.\n\n\"You don't get many chances in life in anything to be a part of something historical,\" Collins said.\n\nThis was why Collins, a perennial hot coaching candidate at Duke, turned down other opportunities until the right job opened. This was the solitary spotlight Collins had earned, away from any shadows cast by working for Duke legend Mike Krzyzewski or growing up the son of a successful NBA coach. This is what the confident 42-year-old whose edginess complements his eloquence expected from the moment he arrived.\n\n\"I am my own guy,\" Collins said, a tad defensively his first day on the job. \"I am going to blaze my own path, and this is the right place for me to do that.\"\n\nWelsh-Ryan Arena reacts as Northwestern is announced into NCAA tournament Watch the reaction at Welsh-Ryan Arena as Northwestern is announced as a No. 8 seed in its first-ever NCAA tournament appearance on March 12, 2017. (Teddy Greenstein/Chicago Tribune) Watch the reaction at Welsh-Ryan Arena as Northwestern is announced as a No. 8 seed in its first-ever NCAA tournament appearance on March 12, 2017. (Teddy Greenstein/Chicago Tribune) See more videos\n\nHow fun that the mother of all NCAA tournament brackets turned a first-round matchup into fathers' day. Perhaps only Homer Drew, Vanderbilt coach Bryce's dad, can relate to the pride Doug Collins will feel when the two teams meet. The fathers don't know each other well \u2014 Homer made his mark in coaching at Valparaiso while Doug worked in the NBA \u2014 but enjoyed each other's company last year when Bryce brought his Valparaiso team to scrimmage Northwestern.\n\nBesides being bright, 42-year-old head coaches \u2014 Chris is 154 days older than Bryce, a candidate for the Northwestern job in 2013 \u2014 Collins and Drew both like having their dads around their program. In the same manner Doug finds a way to be around Northwestern as much as possible, Homer and his wife, Janet, moved to Nashville last fall to be closer to their grandkids \u2014 Bryce hired Casey Shaw, married to Bryce's sister, Dana, on his staff after taking over last March.\n\nThe wholesome images of two of college basketball's intense, intelligent leaders are as similar as the esteemed universities they represent. Only the sense of destiny might feel different this week for the coaches.\n\n\"This isn't an end game,\" Collins said. \"To me, today is a beginning, a day we put ourselves on the national map.\"\n\nThe direction was clear from day one.\n\nChicago Tribune writers make their predictions for the 2017 NCAA tournament."

They won a school-record 30 games and cruised to the Conference-USA regular-season and tournament titles.\n\nThe selection committee must have missed all that, because it made the Blue Raiders a 12 seed. You know, the kind of spot usually reserved for directional schools and conferences most of the country forgets about for all but one month of the year.\n\nBut it was clear throughout the game which team was better.\n\nThe Blue Raiders outrebounded the bigger Gophers 37-24 and were a blistering 7 of 13 from 3-point range.\n\nHIGHLIGHTS FROM THE NCAA TOURNAMENT'S FIRST ROUND", 
        "body2": "A year after Middle Tennessee upset Michigan State, the Blue Raiders did it again, this time winning 81-72 against No. 5 seed Minnesota, which turned out to be its own worst enemy in a hot-and-cold game.\n\nAfter starting the game unanswered, Minnesota\u2019s supremacy sank late in the first half when star Reggie Lynch began collecting fouls like a philatelist does stamps. The second half proved just as detrimental to Lynch, who committed his third of the game, this time a borderline flagrant foul, about a minute after tip off.\n\nThe fouls would continue to haunt Minnesota as the clock ticked on. Amir Coffey, one of the team\u2019s leading scorers, also ran into foul trouble and even Coach Richard Pitino was called for a technical when he argued with the referee.\n\nLynch\u2019s early fouls, however, are what really opened up the game for the Blue Raiders against the Golden Gophers, who were forced to bench their lead defender for much of the game.\n\nMeanwhile, the Blue Raiders took off, extending the six-point lead they\u2019d racked up at halftime to 17 at one point thanks to, well, pretty much everyone.\n\nCompared to Minnesota, which saw three players, Coffey, Dupree McBrayer and Jordan Murphy, score the majority of the team\u2019s points, with 17, 16 and 15, respectively, Middle Tennessee shared the wealth.

        "body0": "There is much about the Trump administration's actions and decisions that could reasonably concern one. The latest block of information to digest has been the budget blueprint, which is an unrealistic fiction of what the country needs and where to most effectively spend money.\n\nCriticism is fine and necessary. However, there is a tendency for people who oppose Trump, and, sadly, for journalists covering the administration, to jump into every utterance and decision with, as a public policy Spinal Tap think tank would say, the dial turned up to 11. A clear example is the claim in some media outlets that the proposed budget would kill Meals on Wheels.\n\nThe relevant Department of Housing and Urban Development section of the budget contains the following language:\n\nEliminates funding for the Community Development Block Grant program, a savings of $3 billion from the 2017 annualized CR level. The Federal Government has spent over $150 billion on this block grant since its inception in 1974, but the program is not well-targeted to the poorest populations and has not demonstrated results. The Budget devolves community and economic development activities to the State and local level, and redirects Federal resources to other activities.\n\nMeals on Wheels, a program that supports the delivery of meals to seniors who cannot afford food or cannot prepare it, started in Australia and has been in the United States since 1954. The program serves 2.4 million seniors every year and does get funding from the Community Development Block Grant program.\n\nBut the situation is complicated and saying that the budget eliminates the Meals on Wheels program is factually incorrect. According to the Meals on Wheels annual IRS filing for 2015 (it isn't a government program), approximately 3.3 percent of its funding comes from government sources. Most is from corporate and foundation grants, with individual contributions the second largest source. Government grants are actually the fifth largest source of revenue.\n\nIf its portions of block grants were eliminated, the program wouldn't suddenly disappear. However, the organization says that it already cannot keep up with growing demand from seniors who need help. In addition, Meals on Wheels passing funding down to 5,000 local groups that provide food, and they additionally might be affected by the funding cut.\n\nWill there be consequences for the program (and others, obviously)? Of course. However, resorting to hysteria is dangerous, and that is happening, both among many on the political left and some media outlets. Such statements can make valid criticism look uninformed and foolish.\n\nInstead, people who are concerned need to dig into the specifics of what is happening, understand the real implications, and then address those.\n\nErik Sherman writes about business, technology, economics, and public policy.

When its Traffic Jam Pilot feature is engaged, the vehicle will need to determine if a driver is alert enough to take control after being a passive passenger for long periods.\n\nThrough its Driver Availability Detection system, sensors will scan the head and face to ensure that the eyes are open and the driver is alert before the car turns over the steering wheel.\n\nAdvanced drowsiness detection systems exist today. For example, Mercedes\u2019s Attention Assist monitors a driver\u2019s behavior for the first 20 minutes behind the wheel to get a baseline of behaviors. Then, the system checks those against as many as 90 indexes, such as steering wheel angle, lane deviation and external factors such as wind gusts and pothole avoidance.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe system can currently detect drowsiness with 80 percent accuracy, said Christoph von Hugo, head of active safety for Mercedes-Benz. If drowsiness is detected, the driver is alerted to the nearest rest stop.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nFor the past decade Volvo has offered its Driver Alert system. \u201cTo detect drowsiness, we study the car, not the driver,\u201d said Mr. Aust of Volvo, looking at differences in the ability of the car to stay in lane, and other factors.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe system detects drowsiness with 97 percent accuracy, Mr. Aust said.\n\nWhile N.H.T.S.A. reported 824 deaths in 2015 because of drowsiness, that number is likely to be considerably higher, the agency said. Drowsy driving can only be self-reported and not measured like drunkenness. Also, drowsiness is not reported when it is a complication of other factors like excessive drinking.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re a nation of tired drivers. People talk about sleep deprivation as if it\u2019s a badge of honor,\u201d said Deborah Hersman, the head of the National Safety Council and the former chairwoman of the National Transportation Safety Board. \u201cAs a society we have to realize that drowsy driving is really dangerous.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nUntil fully autonomous vehicles are a reality, \u201cdrowsiness is something everyone needs to worry about,\u201d said Mark R. Rosekind, former head of N.H.T.S.A. and an expert on human fatigue. \u201cOur tendency is to say we\u2019re wide-awake when in reality we can fall asleep in a second.\u201d\n\nStill, the obvious solution for a driver who feels fatigued is to pull over and rest. According to Mr. Rosekind, studies with airline pilots show that those who took a nap for 26 minutes improved their performance by 34 percent and alertness by 54 percent, compared with those who did not.\n\nRegardless of how good technology is at detecting drowsiness, fighting off sleep is futile. Because sleep is a biological need, the best solution for drivers is still a low-tech one: Pull over and take a nap."

And Commodores guard Matthew Fisher-Davis knows it.\n\nVanderbilt limped to the finish in the second half against the Gators on Friday night, squandering an 8-point lead with 3:27 to go and needing a free throw from Jeff Roberson paired with a strong defensive stop to force overtime.\n\nBut once that overtime period came, there was no lack of confidence against one of the nation\u2019s elite teams. And Fisher-Davis, who hit three 3-point shots on his way to 11 points in the contest, wasn\u2019t shy to share why:\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t lost to them in two years,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we were pretty confident going into overtime.\u201d\n\n14 points later, the Commodores emerged with a 72-62 victory, defeating the league\u2019s No. 2 seed for the third time this season and fifth consecutive time since White took over the Gators program.\n\n\u201cEvery time we\u2019ve played them it\u2019s been really tough, close games,\u201d Vanderbilt senior Luke Kornet said. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s like anything knowing you\u2019re going to win, it\u2019s knowing it\u2019s going to come down to a fight.

Don\u2019t make mistakes. You\u2019ve gotta give them the credit, but a lot of the mistakes we\u2019ve made are easily fixable. We\u2019ve just gotta be better.\u201d\n\nTo his credit, White seemed to acknowledge the Commodores\u2019 status as an emerging threat in the league in the moments following the game.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re the most improved team during the season in the league,\u201d White said after moving to 0-5 against the Commodores. \u201cThey\u2019ve come a long, long way. As much as I thought they have improved offensively during the season, I think they\u2019ve made the same improvement defensively.\n\n\u201cThe last two games, our lack of interior production has a lot more to do with Luke Kornet than it does with my bigs. The credit goes to that guy. He is something else, offensively, and obviously, offensively as well. Our entire scouting report revolves around how to defend a 7-foot-1 that shoots like a 2 guard. I have the utmost respect\u2026 I don\u2019t know him as a person. He seems like a great kid. But as a player, he\u2019s terrific.\u201d",

(Photo: Kelvin Kuo-USA TODAY Sports)\n\nSALT LAKE CITY \u2013 No. 9 seed Vanderbilt\u2019s comeback fell short in a 68-66 loss to No. 8 seed Northwestern in a first-round NCAA Tournament game Thursday.\n\nJunior Matthew Fisher-Davis scored a team-high 18 points to lead a rally from a 15-point second-half deficit, but he also committed a foul that he didn\u2019t have to in putting Northwestern\u2019s Bryant McIntosh on the foul line for the go-ahead free throws.\n\n\"It was a collective effort in coming back, and it was my dumb mistake why we lost,\" Fisher-Davis said.\n\nFisher-Davis said he thought Vandy was down one instead of ahead by one. When Vanderbilt coach Bryce Drew pointed for him to pick up McIntosh, Fisher-Davis thought he was saying to foul him.\n\nVanderbilt finished its season with a 19-16 record in coach Bryce Drew\u2019s debut season.\n\nIt marks the second time in program history that Vanderbilt has lost NCAA tournament openers in back-to-back seasons. It dropped its first game of the 2010 and 2011 NCAA tournaments. It lost to Wichita State 70-50 in last season\u2019s opening round.\n\nFisher-Davis went on a scoring spree late in the second half, burying back-to-back 3-pointers, a running bank shot and a fade-away jumper to start the rally.\n\nBut after Riley LaChance made a driving layup to put Vanderbilt ahead 66-65, Fisher-Davis fouled with 14.6 seconds remaining despite the Commodores being ahead. McIntosh made both foul shots, and Vanderbilt never retook the lead.\n\nFisher-Davis tossed a three-quarter court shot at the final horn that banked off to finish the game.\n\nReach Adam Sparks at asparks@tennessean.com and follow him on Twitter @AdamSparks.", 
        "body2": "Northwestern\u2019s first NCAA tournament appearance in history has already been one to remember, with their 68-66 first-round win over Vanderbilt Thursday coming thanks to one of the more bizarre fouls you\u2019ll ever see. The Wildcats did well early on, leading 34-27 at the half and 49-34 with less than 14 minutes to go, but the Commodores mounted a ferocious comeback led by Matthew Fisher-Davis (who finished with a team-high 22 points despite coming off the bench), and they took a 66-65 lead with 17.8 seconds left on a Riley LaChance layup. However, Fisher-Davis then made a huge mistake, fouling Northwestern\u2019s Bryant McIntosh as he brought the ball up the floor:\n\nAs Vanderbilt didn\u2019t have a foul to give, that let McIntosh go to the line, where he made two free throws to put the Wildcats back in the lead. The Commodores then had another chance, but they couldn\u2019t get the ball inside and settled for a three-point attempt from LaChance with seven seconds left; that missed, and Northwestern got the ball after it went out of bounds. The camera shots there included closeups of a distraught-seeming Fisher-Davis:\n\nA further Vanderbilt foul after Northwestern inbounded led to Sanjay Lumpkin missing and then making a shot, boosting the Wildcats\u2019 lead to 68-66. and then a Fisher-Davis long-range heave at the buzzer missing:\n\nIf that final Fisher-Davis shot had gone in, he\u2019d probably be feeling a lot better about himself right now. It didn\u2019t, though, and that means that his unnecessary foul stood as the crucial play. As TBS studio analyst Charles Barkley later said, it was a true brain-freeze moment under pressure:\n\nThis is a tough one for Fisher-Davis, as he played so well throughout the game. His 22 points were by far the highest on the Vanderbilt side (Luke Kornet was second with 14), and he was key in sparking the comeback that gave the Commodores a chance to win. However, it\u2019s the big moments near the end that most remember, and his unnecessary foul here is going to be long-remembered.\n\nThis is also just the latest twist in a very weird season for Fisher-Davis. The junior guard was benched three times this season, most recently in February where he was held out of a trip to Arkansas thanks to \u201ca violation of athletic department policy.\u201d He led Vanderbilt in scoring with 15.6 points per game at that point. Fisher-Davis has been a key contributor for the Commodores all year, whether in the starting lineup or off the bench, and things seemed to have been going well for him since his return from that last disciplinary action, but this was a tough way for it to end.\n\nOf course, we don\u2019t know that the result would have changed without this foul from Fisher-Davis. Northwestern might have found a way to win anyway, as they still had time for a shot. Still, the Fisher-Davis foul took the pressure off the Wildcats and put it on the Commodores. Unfortunately for them, and for him, that didn\u2019t end well."

It revealed not one by two torn labrums \u2014 one on each hip \u2014 and signaled the end of his basketball career.\n\nFrom that end came a beginning, however: a hip-hop music career.

Recently, though, he was able to combined his two loves of music and basketball by releasing the \"Minnesota March\" song as a send-off for the Gophers' first NCAA tournament appearance since 2013.\n\n\"I went to alumni day, I think they were playing Penn State and I had talked to guys in the office and they askedif I could do the song,\" McKenzie said by phone Thursday morning. \"I had a producer friend and wanted to make something new and upbeat \u2014 something for the kids to turn up to and get excited about.\"\n\nThe lyrics reflect the turnaround the Gophers have embarked upon this season \u2014 from eight victories last year to 24 (and counting) this season going into Thursday's 3 p.m. game between fifth-seeded Minnesota and 12th-seeded Middle Tennessee. The theme of overcoming doubts remains relevant, as several pundits project Middle Tennessee will oust the higher-seeded Gophers. The song builds to a chorus of an updated \"M-I-N-N-E-S-O-T-A\" that fans will be familiar with from \"The Minnesota Rouser.\"\n\n\"I looked at Instagram and saw all the guys being doubted and I really researched it and wrote the song that way,\" McKenzie said.

Still, it was hard to believe.\n\nPerhaps it had something to do with the six banners from Frozen Four appearances hanging behind him at Ridder Arena and the five national championships that stemmed from those trips.\n\n\u201cI think we are an underdog,\u201d he insisted.\n\nBy seeding, yes, the Gophers (26-7-5) are underdogs as they look for their third straight national championship this weekend at the Frozen Four, which begins for them at 8 p.m. Friday against No. 2 seed Clarkson (30-4-5) in St. Charles, Mo., a suburb of St. Louis.\n\nTop-seeded Wisconsin (32-2-4) plays No. 4 seed Boston College (28-5-5) in Friday\u2019s other semifinal, at 5:30 p.m.\n\nMinnesota, which upset third-seeded Minnesota-Duluth last weekend, is the only unseeded team at the Frozen Four, but Clarkson players must be rolling their eyes at the thought of Frost\u2019s team being considered an underdog.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, but on paper we certainly are (the underdog),\u201d Frost said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got some great experience in our locker room, so we\u2019re excited about that, but we know that there\u2019s four real good teams there, and anybody can win it.\u201d\n\nMinnesota has had to overcome a string of injuries that Frost said was unlike any he had seen.\n\nWithin five games, he lost one of his best freshmen and his top senior forward to injuries, although senior Dani Cameranesi has since returned.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a struggle, or a little bit more of a struggle than it has been in the past, this year with injuries and some different things,\u201d Frost said. \u201cAnd then (we went) on the road for the first time in six years in the quarterfinal game. \u2026 So we\u2019re enjoying the run and enjoying the opportunity to get to the Frozen Four. I know everybody on our team except for our freshmen have been there, so we\u2019re looking forward to the experience.\u201d\n\nFriday night\u2019s game is a rematch of the 2014 national championship, which Clarkson won 5-4, the only season since 2012 that Minnesota didn\u2019t win it all.\n\nWhile only the seniors on this year\u2019s team played in 2014, they\u2019ve spread the word to teammates they want payback.\n\n\u201cWe definitely remember that,\u201d said sophomore Sarah Potomak. \u201cWhen we won against Duluth, the seniors told us that their freshman year, Clarkson beat them. We\u2019re just looking forward to trying to get revenge for our seniors. Hopefully we can send our seniors out with a national championship.\u201d\n\nThe Gophers beat Minnesota-Duluth 1-0 last week on a goal in the third period. But to reach yet another national championship, Frost is hoping for more offense.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t been scoring a lot of goals, quite frankly, over the last month,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we\u2019ve been getting great goaltending and playing real solid defense, which you have to have in order to win.\u201d\n\nClarkson ranks No. 4 in women\u2019s hockey in goals scored (3.56 per game) and goals allowed (1.54), better in both areas than Minnesota\u2019s 3.18 goals and 1.71 goals-against. And Clarkson boasts the leading scorer in college hockey in Cayley Mercer, 26 in 39 games.\n\nBut while Frost firmly believes his team is an underdog, his players know Clarkson is going to have a tough time buying that.\n\n\u201cNo team is looking at us like an underdog,\u201d said Kelly Pannek whose 61 points are the most in the country. \u201cIf you ask Clarkson, they\u2019d say the same thing. And I think we relish that. We love that feeling of people not putting us as a top team and not ranking us as a top-4 team, but still playing like a top-4 team. That\u2019s huge for us. We know that we can play with anyone. Everyone knows that they should watch out for us as well.\u201d"

He wore a Cubs jersey with \"COLLINS\" on the back, a memento from having thrown out the ceremonial first pitch at previous games.\n\n\"Had my hat on backward, maybe some eye black on,\" Chris Collins joked.\n\nCollins spotted a contemporary in every sense of the word \u2014 a college basketball coach who learned the game from his father, a man from greater Chicago born in 1974.\n\nBryce Drew.\n\n\"I don't think he recognized me at first because I had a full uniform on,\" Collins said. \"He was dressed all nice, shirt and slacks.

Both proceeded to pose for photos with Clark the Cub. (Sorry to break it to you, Willie the Wildcat.)\n\n\"I wish we'd have gotten a picture together,\" Drew said.\n\nCollins said the same, wishing they had a group photo. You know it would have made the TBS telecast of Thursday's NCAA tournament game between Northwestern and Vanderbilt.\n\n\"We gave each other a hug, said, 'Go, Cubs,' and kept it moving,\" Collins said. \"It's funny to think about that now.\"\n\nThere's a lot of \"funny,\" a lot of parallels, in this NU-Vandy clash that features players you can label student-athletes with a straight face.\n\nIf Collins had been, say, hired by DePaul and unavailable after Northwestern dismissed Bill Carmody in 2013, you know who might have become the Wildcats' coach?\n\nDrew, that's who. He was coming off a 26-8 season at Valparaiso that included a respectable 11-point loss to Michigan State in the NCAA tournament. He interviewed with NU athletic director Jim Phillips and was a strong candidate for the job.\n\nBut Collins was a lights-out candidate, with slightly better ties to Chicago.\n\nBoth have thrived in their jobs, thanks in part to dads who knew all the intricacies of basketball \u2014 but also knew when to back off.\n\nHomer Drew was Valpo's head coach for 22 seasons, sharing the floor with Bryce for four years and the bench for another six.\n\nNorthwestern players prepare for their NCAA tournament game against Vanderbilt in Salt Lake City.\n\n\"He would make decisions I didn't agree with,\" Bryce Drew said. \"And about two weeks later, I could see why he was right. Now that I've gotten older, I value his wisdom and feedback even more. He balances when to talk with when not to talk. If we lose, it's not a time to tell me a lot of things.\"\n\nDoug Collins also knew when to let the car idle.\n\n\"If he ever senses that he's overstepping his bounds, he backs off,\" Chris Collins said. \"If he does come to practice, he's never on the floor. He goes up in the seats. And when practice is over, our guys go and talk to him and listen to all the old stories.\n\n\"He's kind of like the grandpa to all of them, which he loves. He's been great. He never tries to do anything with X's and O's.\"\n\nHomer Drew will be in Salt Lake City on Thursday. So will Doug Collins. He worked Wednesday night for ESPN in Los Angeles.\n\n\"A quick flight,\" Chris Collins said.\n\nCollins has extensive NCAA tournament experience \u2014 52 games as a player and assistant coach at Duke. But Wednesday marked his first time as the boss on an open practice day on the eve of a tournament game.\n\nAt the end of Northwestern's allotted 40-minute session, he posed for pictures with his team, with Phillips and finally with his son, Ryan.\n\nRecalling the moment, his voice cracked.\n\n\"Awesome,\" Collins said. \"Those were the moments that I loved growing up ... being with my dad, going to NBA locker rooms. To be able to do that with my own son is cool.\n\n\"A couple of times in the open practice, I looked over and saw (Ryan) rebound with the guys, smiling ear to ear.

        "body0": "\u00d7 The \u201cCatournament\u201d Journal: Chris Collins, Bryce Drew and the Cubs\u2019 World Series\n\nSALT LAKE CITY \u2013 If only someone had remembered to grab some photographic evidence of the event.\n\nThis picture would have really come in handy this week for the coaches for Northwestern and Vanderbilt basketball.\n\n\u201cI wish we would have taken a group photo if we would have known this was going to happen,\u201d said Wildcats head coach Chris Collins of the historic run-in with friend and Commodores\u2019 coach Bryce Drew.\n\nNot that the coach\u2019s meeting was something for the history books. But the event the were at certainly was \u2013 Game 4 of the 2016 World Series at Wrigley Field. It was just the second such game for the Cubs in 71 years as the team made their historic run to a championship \u2013 and it just so happens that Drew along with Collins were there.\n\nTo be fair, it might have been hard for the Vanderbilt coach to recognize his coaching colleague from Northwestern.\n\n\u201cI had a full uniform on that night. He was dressed all nice, he had a nice shirt on and slacks. I had my Cubs jersey on, my hat on backwards, and maybe some eye black on,\u201d said Collins of his attire. \u201cHe did a double take when I went and said hello to him. It was pretty funny.\u201d\n\nDrew concurred when asked about the meeting on Wednesday during the news conferences prior his Vanderbilt team\u2019s first round match-up with Northwestern in Salt Lake City.\n\n\u201cMy wife and I went to a Cubs World Series game, and getting a picture with the mascot and here comes Chris Collins in his Cubs jersey and his wife,\u201d said Drew. \u201cWe talked there back in October.\u201d\n\nThe man in the middle of this meeting? None other than the team\u2019s mascot.\n\n\u201cWe each took our photos with our wives with Clark the Cub,\u201d said Collins. \u201cGave each other a hug, and said, Go Cubs, and kept it moving. It\u2019s funny to think about that now.\u201d\n\nIt would be incorrect to say that this was the first meeting between the two, since Collins and Drew have crossed paths during their coaching days outside of Wrigley Field.\n\n\u201cSo we\u2019ve always kind of connected because we come from basketball families. Our dads were coaches. We grew up in gyms and the game,\u201d said Collins. \u201cSo we\u2019ve always connected on that level and gotten along really well.\u201d\n\nThat might change on Thursday since each other\u2019s seasons depend on beating the other. Eight-seeded Northwestern has all the hype as they\u2019ve finally qualified for their first-ever NCAA Tournament. Meanwhile Drew is taking Vanderbilt to the \u201cBig Dance\u201d for the first time as the head coach of the Commodores after five years at Valparaiso.\n\n\u201cChris has always been great to me on the road, great to me whenever we talk. He sent me some encouraging texts this year,\u201d said Drew of Collins. \u201cHe\u2019s a great coach. He\u2019s been really, really good to me.\u201d\n\nNow if they only had that photo.", 
        "body2": "Insider\n\nWe continue our recruit and return series with the Vanderbilt Commodores, whose season ended Thursday with a loss to Northwestern in the West Region. Here is a look at what the 2017-18 season could hold:\n\nPossible 2017-18 starting five:\n\nG: Riley LaChance\n\nG: Matthew Fisher-Davis\n\nG: Joe Toye\n\nF: Jeff Roberson\n\nF: Clevon Brown\n\nWho is lost: Part of the reason Vanderbilt was so difficult to defend this past season was the presence of Luke Kornet on the offensive end. At 7-foot-1, Kornet was one of the best 3-point shooters on the team and really spread out the defense. With Kornet graduating, Bryce Drew won\u2019t have a tailor-made replacement, and Kornet\u2019s ability to stretch the floor will be missed. Former Cornell transfer Nolan Cressler is also gone after shooting 43 percent from 3-point range the past season. He brought versatility to the Commodores\u2019 perimeter group.\n\nWho is added: Drew\u2019s first recruiting class will fill some voids in Nashville. The highest-rated prospect is four-star center Ejike Obinna, who will help replace Kornet -- but is completely different. Obinna is athletic and will help immediately on the defensive end of the floor, potentially changing the look of Vanderbilt\u2019s frontcourt. A pair of three-star point guards also enter the program in Saban Lee and Maxwell Evans. Lee in particular could be an immediate impact player. He\u2019s long and athletic and loves to push the tempo. He could allow LaChance to move off the ball for stretches. Larry Austin Jr., a transfer from Xavier, is eligible next season.\n\nWhat it means for next season: Drew has five of his top seven back from this season. Matthew Fisher-Davis and LaChance both averaged in double figures and are two of the best shooters in the SEC. Fisher-Davis led the team in scoring, despite a late-season slump. LaChance is one of the best shooters in the country, burying nearly 50 percent of his shots from behind the arc while distributing effectively. The addition of some ball-handlers in the recruiting class will certainly help. Jeff Roberson is an inside-outside weapon up front. His shooting from 3-point range dropped off as a junior, but he improved his rebounding and ability to score in the paint. Chicago native Joe Toye saw a major bump in minutes late in the season and established himself as a key shooter and versatile defender. Expect Clevon Brown to see more time down low next season. Payton Willis is a versatile perimeter weapon.\n\nTrending: Level. Drew got Vanderbilt to the NCAA tournament in his first season at the helm, and there will be an influx of talent into the program. The loss of Kornet will hurt, though, and remember: This team lost 15 games before the NCAA tournament."
