        "body0": "Stacy Revere Getty Images  After using the franchise tag on wide receiver Alshon Jeffery last offseason  the Chicago Bears are reportedly not expected to do the same this year   According to NFL Network's Ian Rapoport  Chicago is likely to allow the 27 year old to hit the open market  Jeff Dickerson of ESPN confirmed Rapoport's report   Jeffery finished 2016 with 52 receptions for 821 yards and two touchdowns  He missed four games due to a suspension for violating the NFL's performance enhancing drug policy   He also sat out seven games in 2015 due to injury  but he was productive when healthy with 807 yards and four scores   The second round pick out of South Carolina topped the 1 000 yard mark in both 2013 and 2014  and he was named to his only Pro Bowl in 2013 after a career high 89 catches and 1 421 yards to go along with seven touchdowns   At 6'4  and 230 pounds  Jeffery is a matchup nightmare for opposing cornerbacks  but his inability to remain on the field in recent years makes investing heavily in him risky   According to Jason La Canfora of CBSSports com  however  the Philadelphia Eagles are among the teams that may be willing to pay a significant price to land him   Should the Bears allow Jeffery to walk  they may need to turn to the draft   Kevin White was Chicago's first round pick in 2015  but he has just 19 receptions in four career games due to injury  Cameron Meredith emerged to lead the Bears with 66 grabs for 888 yards and four TDs in 2016  and veteran Eddie Royal remains in the mix as a slot receiver as well   Chicago also has an unsettled quarterback situation with Jay Cutler likely to be sent packing  but it does own the No  3 overall pick in the draft  Should the Bears bring in a young quarterback without a true No  1 wideout  it will make the learning curve even steeper ", 
        "body2": "What we  knew  most about the 2016 Bears heading into the season is that  offensively  Jay Cutler and Alshon Jeffery would be the straws that stirred the offensive drink   Thanks to injuries  suspension and a perfect storm that resulted in a 3 13 season  the straw had a hole in it  the team still couldn't collectively close out games and a fifth round rookie  Jordan Howard  and a second year undrafted free agent  Cam Meredith  turned into the greatest causes for optimism on that side of the ball   The news that the team is shopping Cutler is hardly news bulletin worthy  We've written about Cutler Fatigue here and discussed it on CSN's BearsTalk Podcasts for some time now  A breakup has seemed inevitable after eight years of  500 ball when he's been behind center  The tricky part is finding an alternative that would be a marked improvement for a coaching staff that might need to finish  500 to continue on the job in 2018  Yet that's the gamble that must be taken for a franchise that almost needs to move on  for better or worse  in order to find a way out of the muddy ditch it's found itself in   Cutler must first be deemed healthy enough after labrum surgery on his throwing shoulder   something similar to what Buffalo did with Tyron Taylor this week following groin surgery  But Taylor might be a safer bet to stay with the Bills than Cutler is here  Those medicals might be out there already around the league if shopping has truly begun  And while a new destination for Cutler might not earn him the same salary  roughly  15 million  he'd make here  the thinking here is he'd prefer a fresh start just as much as the Bears want one   So let's go shopping   Cleveland  No   San Francisco as a stopgap starter  Maybe  There's tons of salary cap space while a successor is groomed  and there's the Shanahan  Kyle Mike  Factor  But more losing   How about Jacksonville to push his young clone  Blake Bortles  Perhaps  There's still a loaded  talented young defense that has yet to reach a promising ceiling  and a couple of talented receivers   The Los Angeles Rams could provide a push for Jared Goff  though it's hard not to see Goff being the starter  for better or worse   But if something should happen  Cutler would be ready  with Todd Gurley  what should be a respectable defense and a location close to where wife Kristin Cavallari can return to actressing   Jay in Buffalo  Good one   Arizona has already shot down interest   We don't see Denver wanting him back as they await Paxton Lynch's maturity with Trevor Siemian as a bridge   Reuniting with Adam Gase in Miami could be an option with Ryan Tannehill's health still a mystery   Then there's always Houston  I'm looking for Tony Romo's ultimate destination impacting Jay's   But retiring  as some reports this week suggested  No  Despite the public perception  Jay is a competitor  and I truly believe that still runs through him  He may not get to prove his reputation wrong before he retires  but despite what body language experts feel  I believe he'd still like to prove something  But I'm also not counting on any team giving up a draft pick for him  Teams know the Bears will release him  but if a club lower on the waiver claim wire truly desires him  Ryan Pace has squeezed something out from teams for his players on the discard pile before   As for Jeffery  all remains quiet on the franchise tag front  The seal remains tight at Halas Hall over whether there have been any negotiations this past week  and if so  whether they've moved in a positive  long term direction   Two things to keep in mind  the Bears did not tag him last year until the day before the deadline to do so  That deadline this year is March 1  The other is the fact that other teams in similar situations  such as Washington with Kirk Cousins and Kansas City with Eric Berry and Dontari Poe  have yet to make moves either  as that deadline looms  If the Bears determine they'll cut ties with Cutler  Eddie Royal and Lamarr Houston  that will free up another  24 million in cap space on top of the  60 million plus they have already  Perhaps that factors into the decision on Jeffery  who'd get paid  17 million in 2017 under a second straight franchise tag for a team that needs play makers and a coaching staff that needs wins next season  Letting him go would require attention and a portion of those dollars to replace him in the draft and or free agency   We leave all our internet talk radio caller GM's with this question  Would you REALLY want to be in Ryan Pace's shoes this offseason  Can you be as shrewd  wise and run the table to the extent he must  especially at the most important  franchise shaping position  which  granted  he's put on the back burner his first two years   And  get it right  to build momentum moving forward for a franchise that's reached the playoffs just once in the past decade  The rebuild remains substantial  And so are the decisions he faces in a crucial offseason ", 
        "body1": "Indianapolis will again become the NFL's hub this week  playing host to the annual scouting combine  As always  much of the TV spotlight and outside hype will center around the 330 draft eligible invitees who will partake in on field testing  medical examinations and interview sessions   Yet for Bears general manager Ryan Pace and coach John Fox  the business demands will stretch beyond their draft preparation homework  Pace and Fox are scheduled to meet with reporters Wednesday at the Indianapolis Convention Center to offer their offseason updates  As that session closes in  here are four Bears storylines worth keeping tabs on   The big catch  Photos of Bears wide receiver Alshon Jeffery   Say this for Alshon Jeffery  He doesn't lack for self confidence  On the final day of the regular season  after a 28 point loss to the Vikings completed a 3 13 season  Jeffery boldly declared that the Bears would win the Super Bowl next season   A day later  when asked if he stood behind that proclamation  Jeffery affirmed his stance   Damn right   he said    I really believe it in my heart    Misguided  Probably  Outlandish  Absolutely  But with Jeffery  such bravado comes from a well intentioned place  The veteran receiver has a competitive streak and a deep belief in his own abilities  And that's not to be overlooked as he prepares to dip his toes into free agency for the first time   Jeffery badly wants to be part of a winner  He also hopes to land a mega contract that will offer him fair compensation and long term security  So will he prioritize loyalty to the Bears over a desire to land the richest deal possible   The consensus around the NFL is that Jeffery will be one of the 10 most talented players to hit the open market March 9  And it's easy to argue that the Bears ultimately need Jeffery more than he needs them  After all  if Jeffery wound up departing  wouldn't that spell trouble for an offense that has only two other receivers   Cameron Meredith and Kevin White   locked into the 2017 plans   Still  don't expect Pace to lose his business discipline if a high priced auction breaks out on the first day of the new league year   The Bears have plenty of room under the salary cap and are very much interested in keeping Jeffery around  even after his 2016 season  52 catches  821 yards  two touchdowns  was interrupted by a four game suspension for a violation of the league's policy on performance enhancing drugs   But Pace also isn't hellbent on becoming the highest bidder if Jeffery's price tag shoots too high   The Bears still have understandable questions about Jeffery's dependability and potential for growth  So just where will Pace draw the line in his negotiations   Adding complexity to the issue is the lack of direction the Bears seem to have on offense  Other than a familiar setting  what can the Bears truly sell Jeffery on with yet another new receivers coach  Zach Azzanni   likely a new starting quarterback and a postseason drought that has reached six seasons and counting   Any takers   Photos of Bears quarterback Jay Cutler   At last year's combine  Fox labeled quarterback Jay Cutler  one of the brightest spots  of his first season in Chicago  lauding the quarterback's mental toughness and ability to execute under pressure  A year later  it seems to be a matter of when  not if  Fox and the Bears will permanently pull the plug on Cutler   From the front office's perspective  think of Cutler as that outdated toaster in the corner of the kitchen that's no longer of much use  The first option  Set him out on a garage sale table and hope someone desperate offers some form of compensation   anything really   to take him away  And if no one does  Then he's out to the front porch for the next Salvation Army pickup   That  in a nutshell  is how the trade or cut question will likely play out in the coming weeks  And the Bears are certain to use their time at the combine to measure outside interest in Cutler   Even Cutler's biggest backers at Halas Hall seem to understand that new direction is needed at the position  So the Bears must identify the most fruitful separation strategy   Through that lens  any public comments Pace or Fox makes this week about Cutler must be properly filtered  Any praise of Cutler's recovery from shoulder surgery or optimism about his future potential should not be interpreted as a vote of confidence in Cutler but more so as a calculated sales pitch to other rabbit eared NFL general managers   The Bears' phone lines are open  Any and all offers will be considered   Third watch  Jonathan Allen Kevin C  Cox   Getty Images Alabama's Jonathan Allen tackles Washington's Myles Gaskin during the Chick fil A Peach Bowl on Dec  31  2016 in Atlanta  Alabama's Jonathan Allen tackles Washington's Myles Gaskin during the Chick fil A Peach Bowl on Dec  31  2016 in Atlanta   Kevin C  Cox   Getty Images   Kevin C  Cox   Getty Images   The Bears own the No  3 overall pick in April's draft  a nice consolation prize for last season's misery  Now  how will they use it   If Pace wants to add his quarterback of the future in Round 1  he'll start with an intense evaluation of Clemson's Deshaun Watson and North Carolina's Mitch Trubisky  Maybe even Notre Dame's DeShone Kizer  But if the 40 year old GM stays true to a philosophy of taking the best player available  the focus may instead shift to Alabama defensive lineman Jonathan Allen  LSU safety Jamal Adams or Ohio State defensive backs Malik Hooker or Marshon Lattimore   The combine will give the Bears a chance to thicken their scouting reports on those defensive difference makers  Allen might be the safest bet  a disruptive force who would be an immediate starter at end in the Bears' 3 4 defense  Allen is stout against the run and has shown an ability to consistently push the pocket as a pass rusher  His combination of quickness and power is elite and would make him an intriguing fit alongside Eddie Goldman and Akiem Hicks up front   Open for business  A scheduling shift pushed this year's combine back on the calendar and closer to the start of free agency  a change that is being celebrated by agents and team executives alike  In recent years  the casual preliminary free agency discussions that were had at the combine lacked urgency as teams and agents slowly felt each other out  But with the combine now oozing into March and butting up against the opening of the new league year  March 9   there's a sense that the business conversations in Indy will be a lot more meaningful this week ",

only one in Philadelphia paying tribute to the Dominican Republic s independence from Haiti 173 years ago   The Dominican population in the city is at a record high  having almost tripled in the last decade  from 7 688 in 2005 to 23 974 in 2015  according to data from the Census Bureau  Dominicans  or Quisqueyanos  surpassed Mexicans in 2010 as the second largest Hispanic group in the city  trailing only Puerto Ricans  who account for 65 percent of the total Hispanic population   Like Dur n  many recent Dominicans leave their beloved island for higher wages and to join family and friends already settled in Philadelphia  As the community grows in numbers  so does its influence  First  and even second generation Dominican leaders have emerged  community organizations have expanded  and Dominican owned businesses continue to boom   Victor Vazquez Hernandez  the department chair of social sciences at Miami Dade College  said the Dominican boom in Philadelphia began in the 1990s as thousands of Dominicans left New York City in search of more affordable housing    As more Dominicans got established in Philadelphia  more came directly from the Dominican Republic   said Vazquez Hernandez  who used to teach at Temple University   And they branched out to places like Allentown and Reading  That chain migration really took off    Luisa Hernandez  48  arrived in Philadelphia in 2000 after leaving the Dominican Republic and living two years in Puerto Rico and New York City  She chose Philly for its affordability and economic growth   Like many Dominican women in Philadelphia  the mother of two is a hair stylist and has owned Ashley Beauty Salon on Sixth Street and Erie Avenue since 2006  She also called the Dominican boom in Philadelphia a  chain migration     For example  I came here because of a friend  and because of me  about ten other Dominicans have moved to Philadelphia   Hernandez said of Northeast Philly   For years  I never met anyone here from my hometown  Mao  Now  there are so many people from Mao    Danilo Burgos  a cofounder of Philadelphia s Dominican Grocers Association  has his own theory regarding the uptick of Dominicans' arriving from the island    Philadelphia  maybe 10 years ago  started having direct flights to the Dominican Republic   said the American born Burgos   Now we re starting to see Dominicans that come directly to the city before going through New York or Miami    And first generation Dominicans in Philadelphia continue to outnumber American born Dominicans  according to an Inquirer analysis of 2014 Census Bureau data using IPUMS USA  a census research project at the University of Minnesota   While 42 percent of the Philadelphia Dominican population is U S  born  57 percent is foreign born  presumably in the Dominican Republic  Additionally  63 percent of Dominicans in Philadelphia are U S  citizens  either naturalized or U S  born   and 34 percent are not U S  citizens  either visa  and green card holders  or here illegally    Diojenes   who preferred not to give his last name   is emblematic of an unknown number of Dominicans who are in Philadelphia illegally   Diojenes  40  fled the Dominican Republic in 2010 to Mexico  Guided by armed smugglers   they were children  8 to 10 years old  he said   Diojenes crossed the Rio Grande into McAllen  Texas   He was detained by the border patrol and jailed for seven days  His wife  who was in Philadelphia on a visa  helped him post the  7 500 bail and hired an immigration lawyer  Diojenes was released and traveled to Philadelphia as his court case dragged on for years  He stopped appearing in court after two years  fearing the possibility of deportation    Look  the U S  is looking primarily for illegal immigrants with criminal records   Diojenes said   I have a clean record  I came here to work    In 2013  he scraped together  95 000 from relatives to open a bodega in North Philadelphia  which now has two employees  Diojenes  a father of three  said his  honest work  has borne fruit    You know  everyone has a dream   said Diojenes  speaking over the quintessential bachata music blasting in his bodega   My dream is to own something that can sustain my family    Dominicans in the city traditionally have been known for opening bodegas and hair salons    In the '80s  you started seeing a few bodegas   said Jos  Joaqu n Mota  a co founder of the Dominican Grocers Association and vice consul in Philadelphia   Now  you have over 2 000 bodegas owned by Dominicans    Mota believes that the Census Bureau numbers underestimate the size of the Dominican community in the city  which he estimates is 50 000   At a political level  Dominicans in Philadelphia have yet to elect one of their own into office   Burgos came close when he placed second in the 197th District State House Democratic primary in 2014  losing to Leslie Acosta  who later resigned  after pleading guilty to conspiracy to commit money

they had burned down a house in the neighboring hamlet of  vila  The Kreyol language stations on her radio warned of ethnic violence and that immigrants would soon have to register with the Dominican government  There would be mass deportations and perhaps a reprise of the Parsley Massacre  the 1937 mass murder of as many as 30 000 ethnic Haitians   So Ena and her family fled  One day in late July 2015  taking only what she could carry  she simply walked across the border into Haiti  The t gueres stole everything she left behind   We lost the small store we owned  along with our livestock   she says  adding that the thieves were never punished    Here  we can barely find water to drink   she says  her voice choking with despair  Facebook  Twitter  More shares recommend reddit email    Now Louissaint is 33 years old and lives in Parc Cadeau  a remote  squalid refugee camp that houses some 2 000 people  It's a haphazard collection of huts  hovels  and lean tos that stretches alongside a dusty white gravel road  Ena and the others drink water from the dirty Pedernales River or a nearby agricultural canal  Both sources are untreated  and an outbreak of cholera last year killed 14 people   There is no electricity and no sanitation in the camp  and dirt paths connect randomly placed abodes  It was all built in a rush with whatever material residents could find  No one expected to live here for years  The sturdiest shelters are composed of sticks covered in mud  They're roofed in thatch that keeps out most of the water  The flimsiest are made of rain warped cardboard and rusting sheets of corrugated zinc  One family has lived for months in a donated Coleman camping tent  There are no trees for shade  only thorny shrubs   Though nearby Anse   Pitres and Pedernales are home to a shared bazaar where everything from Norwegian herring to Vietnamese made Converse sneakers are sold  Louissaint has little chance of finding the cash to become a vendor   or even of renting land to cultivate   Here  we can barely find water to drink sometimes   she says  her voice choking with despair   and no one is helping    Louissaint holds little hope of returning to the country where she grew up and that she knows best  She doesn't have Haitian or Dominican identity documents  Nor does she have the 50 Dominican pesos to bribe a border guard  And she doesn't want to talk about what happens to Haitian women who get caught crossing the border without the requisite bribe   A year and a half ago  Louissaint was one of the 750 000 Haitians living and working in the Dominican Republic  But a series of events  set off by a 2013 Dominican Supreme Court ruling that stripped more than 200 000 Dominicans of Haitian descent of their birthright citizenship  forced her to flee  The Inter American Court of Human Rights  Amnesty International  Human Rights Watch  and Oxfam condemned that ruling  The United States government remained mute   The law has become part of what is known as la apatrida   the civil genocide  which declared Dominicans of Haitian descent born as far back as the 1930s to be  in transit    only passing through   even if they had spent their entire lives in the Dominican Republic  After October 2013  an already marginalized underclass suddenly couldn't legally own property  vote  or work formally in the private sector  Nor could they send their children to school past the fourth grade  The ruling was found to violate the United Nations' Universal Declaration of Human Rights  The Dominican government ignored that finding   Haitians and their Dominican born children  who in some cases barely spoke Kreyol  were required to register by July 2015  They were 7 percent of the population  but few had the required birth certificates and identification cards   Panic spread  Newspapers in Santo Domingo began speaking of the  invasion  of a  dark army  whose greatest weapon was a high birth rate   of the need to defend the fatherland against uneducated savages  Erroneous reports circulated of a Haitian being lynched in the Dominican city of Santiago  Louissaint's worries peaked when the t gueres showed up in the hills near her home in Pedernales  just across the border from Anse   Pitres   In summer 2015  more than 70 000 people fled the Dominican Republic for Haiti  The Dominican government  in an Orwellian twist  called them  voluntary returnees   Like Louissaint  they lost their homes  businesses  and property  For a time  international news and human rights organizations publicized the refugees' problems  Then they were forgotten   Louissaint and the other residents of Parc Cadeau tell a story of intense intimidation and fear  Long after they were chased down from the hills and left to live in wretched poverty on this dust filled plain  they remain here  out of the international spotlight and out of luck   No one is helping us anymore   Louissaint says   not even the parish priest     I left because of the threats   says Wayom  who has lived in a tent for more than a year   The bosses wanted us out   Photo by Mario Ariza  Eliseo Jean Luis isn't quite sure how old he is  A tall  rail thin  gray haired father of 11  he thinks he must be pushing 60  But because he was born in a rural part of the Dominican Republic to illiterate parents who were never issued a birth certificate  he can't be sure  Though he speaks fluent Spanish and can name more Dominican towns than Haitian ones  he doesn't plan to ever go back to the land of his birth  He has lived in dusty Parc Cadeau for a year and a half but would like to resettle deeper into Haiti   A thousand pesos could get me out of here   he says   Jean Luis left his home because he was afraid  He and his wife walked across the border and into Haiti in early July 2015  They left behind a life growing beans in Las Mercedes  a hill town 13 miles from Pedernales  When he talks about his decision to return to Haiti  his voice drops to a hushed tone   The t gueres showed up one night in June  They were on motorcycles  They had machetes and pistols    Jean Luis says they caught him on the road as he was walking back to his home  He thinks they didn't hurt him because he looks so old  But they insulted him and told him to return to his country  or else   He says he felt like  the t gueres from Pedernales wanted to burn us all  and the radio was saying it was going to be like 1937 all over again    His voice lowers to a whisper when he mentions that far off year  He's like many Haitians on the island  one of Columbus' first landing spots in the New World  He still shudders at the thought of the genocide perpetrated by American backed dictator Rafael Leonidas Trujillo exactly 80 years ago   The Spanish speaking Dominican Republic and the mostly Kreyol speaking Haiti share the island of Hispaniola  a landmass that's 700 miles from Miami and about the size of North Carolina  The island's 137 mile  mountainous border divides the Western Hemisphere's poorest nation from Latin America's fastest growing economy   Because the majority of both countries' populations are of African descent  the genocide perpetrated by Dominicans against Haitians can be difficult to understand for Americans  says Harvard professor Lorgia Garc a Pe a   Early in the 16th Century  the Spaniards said  'Fuck sugar   there's gold in Peru and native people we can exploit ' so they abandoned Hispaniola   she says   To be negro   black  in Spanish  meant you were a slave  so even just one drop of white blood meant a better social position    The French showed up early in the 18th Century and took the western side of the island  They quickly imported millions of slaves and turned the French colony of Saint Domingue into the richest in the New World  The new influx of slaves meant that being something other than  negro  became much more important to the mixed race Spaniards on the island's eastern side   The French slaves heroically rebelled in 1791 and eventually conquered the whole island  Ultimately  Dominicans of all colors rose up against the Haitian occupation and gained independence in 1844    Dominican mulattos made the Republic possible   Garc a Pe a clarifies   but then the white people took over    The United States occupied Haiti in 1915 and the Dominican Republic in 1916 and helped a white elite to consolidate power in the latter  Along with building roads and providing sanitation  the United States brought institutionalized racism to the island and began importing Haitian labor to work in the Dominican Republic's sugarcane fields  Since then  Haitian labor has been integral to Dominican success    We feel like what the Dominican Republic is doing is equal to some type of apartheid in the Caribbean   says Marleine Bastien  director of Fanm Ayisyen nan Miyami  a community social services nonprofit based in Miami  She helped organize the Haitian diaspora's response to la apatrida   We went to Congress but got nowhere   Bastien remembers   We felt that  la apatrida  was very unfair  Haitians had built Dominican infrastructure and were now being kicked out    One activist  the Pulitzer Prize winning Dominican writer Junot D az  testified before Congress alongside Haitian writer Edwidge Danticat about the civil genocide  The Dominican government responded by stripping D az of a national prize he had been given in 2009  Authorities cited his  un Dominican activities    Though a law was passed in 2014 to allow Haitians to stay in the Dominican Republic and get access to social services  hundreds of thousands couldn't meet its stringent requirements  Among them  If one lacked proper documents  one would need testimony from two people who had been present at one's birth    Hypocritical  is how Bastien describes it   The interior ministry knew the burden placed on families was too high    The Dominican government claims that Louissaint  Jean Luis  and the other residents of Parc Cadeau left the country of their own accord    self deported    In a sense  they did  Filled with fear  some 4 000 people fled to Parc Cadeau  Today there are about 2 000 left  Though more than 230 000 Haitian migrants in the Dominican Republic have registered for new documents  a half million haven't   Recently  deportations have slowed  mob assaults have been reported less often  and there has even been some humanitarian cooperation   But all of this is far from the mind of Eliseo Jean Luis  His concerns are more immediate  clean water  cash for food  shelter from the dust and sun  Asked about his hope for the future  his face clouds over and his eyes narrow  In a voice choked with emotion  he says   Everything here is fucked    Mackenz n Augiste is tired of having to hike up a hill next to Parc Cadeau to defecate  A 27 year old father of three who was born and raised across the border in the hills above Pedernales  he leans his gaunt  exhausted frame against the sill of his dilapidated hut's only window  Then he speaks in slow  measured  Kreyol accented Spanish   I don't feel well here  There's nothing to eat  Sometimes I go days without eating  and I just got over being sick   His sickness shows  His skin is sallow  and he sounds defeated   Augiste was a cowherd for a Dominican farmer on the other side  With exhaustion  he notes that the camp's eight rudimentary latrines have filled up in the past year and a half  Residents are forced up into the hills or down to the river when they need to go to the bathroom  A similar situation is likely what led to last year's cholera outbreak   When it's dry  the wind kicks up the shit and the dust and makes us sick  When it rains  everything in my house gets soaked  and we get sick  I'm tired of it   Asked why he hasn't moved farther into Haiti  Mackenz n says he doesn't know the country  He spent his whole life in the Dominican Republic  and on clear days  he stares out across the river toward his former home   Cadeau means  gift  in Kreyol  which seems entirely ironic  especially as one approaches the camp on a motorbike  leaving the unfinished concrete houses of Anse   Pitres behind for the unforgiving  cactus spiked scrubland of the south of Hispaniola  The settlement sits on a plain some four or five miles wide  From a hill above the camp  one can glimpse the shallow Pedernales River as it bends toward the Caribbean Sea  Across the road from the haphazard collection of slapdash houses and bare gray lots is a series of naked limestone cliffs that marks where the ocean  millions of years ago  used to be   Asked how he feels since moving  the former cowherd says   It's been a calamity   Facebook  Twitter  More shares recommend reddit email    A farmer named it  gift park  because one of his cows birthed twin calves shortly after he purchased the land  Last winter  as if fulfilling the plot's name  that farmer's son let a few destitute souls squat here  That number grew and then fell as residents left to move deeper into Haiti or were resettled by international organizations   According to camp residents who did not wish to be identified  the International Organization for Migration  IOM   a nonprofit based in Switzerland  gave almost a thousand people money to rent homes in Anse   Pitres  But residents report that the organization hasn't helped enough of them  and they complain that after the rent money ran out  the people who had received aid returned because they couldn't find jobs   Juan Baca  the chief of mission for the IOM in the Dominican Republic  neither conformed nor denied the residents' allegations  He said he had no firsthand experience of the camp  But  he added   It's possible that many in the camps stayed because they were awaiting the possibility of receiving aid    Pierre Paul Edouane is not just waiting for aid  In some ways  his life parallels that of Mackenz n  He is also a 27 year old resident of the camp who was born and raised across the border  A serious and thoughtful man who chooses his words carefully and could use a shave  he cares for the small makeshift chapel built of palm thatch that stands in the center of Parc Cadeau  He helps distribute what little aid arrives these days   Inside the chapel  Edouane takes advantage of the shadowy coolness to explain why he and so many other residents have stayed in Parc Cadeau despite the precarious conditions    There were three kinds of people here last year  The first knew where they were from in Haiti and went back home  The second knew where they were from but didn't have a place to go in Haiti anymore  The third  like me  didn't know Haiti at all  The second and third have stayed    Edouane isn't even considering a return to the Dominican Republic to register   I don't have any papers  nor do I have money to go back   He tries not to feel defeated   He's philosophical about his time spent in the Dominican Republic   Life over there was better  in the sense that you could eat  but here in Haiti  there is no harassment  no one attacks us   As he speaks  Edouane cradles a coconut  He explains it's from a small plot of Haitian land his father purchased with money earned during 37 years of sharecropping in the Dominican Republic   He uses yield from the tiny half acre plot to feed his wife and child  But he must share whatever the land produces with his father's seven other children  Edouane says he feels both Dominican and Haitian  even if he can't return to the country where he was born   Neither the Haitian government nor local politicians have done much to aid these Dominican born Parc Cadeau residents  There is not much work to be found aside from the occasional cutting of a tree for charcoal  Nor is there counseling to help folks find jobs in tourism  agriculture  or other industries   Asked how he feels since moving to Parc Cadeau  Augiste  the former cowherd  says   It's been a calamity    For Haitians who have stayed in the Dominican Republic  even registering kids for school is tough  Photo by Mario Ariza  Jean Marie Telemac is of Haitian lineage but is different in many ways from the residents of Parc Cadeau  The lean father of five with a sun weathered face has lived in Las Mercedes  a hill town in the Dominican Republic about 20 miles from Parc Cadeau  since 1986   When the t gueres came to his town in June 2015  Telemac   with his hard set jaw  steely eyes  and peasant stubbornness   didn't budge   I have a good relationship with my Dominican landlord   he explains while softly patting a sheathed machete attached to his belt  There are thousands like him who remained in the hills   He has traveled to the town of Pedernales  13 miles from his home  for an appointment at the civil registry the next morning  He has applied for the third time for documents so his two daughters can study in the Dominican Republic   I would like to see all my children studying   he says   Telemac is angling for the kind of card that one third of the Haitian migrants in the Dominican Republic have received  But because his daughters were not issued birth certificates by Dominican authorities   it's going to be difficult   he says   Since they don't have documents  they can't get documents     I was raised there  had my kids there  but I would never go back   Facebook  Twitter  More shares recommend reddit email    In a phone interview  the IOM's Baca qualifies the new identity card program as a relative success  He claims few other countries   including the United States   offer immigrants access to social services like the Dominican Republic offers   It's true that when the deadline was coming  there was a lot of noise and fear in the Haitian community   he says   But there's been a sea change in the  Dominican  government attitude toward Haitian migration    Says Harvard's Garc a Pe a   That's bullshit  and you can quote me on that    This is a racialized system of oppression and control  If the idea is to regularize  then why denationalize Dominicans of Haitian descent going back all the way to 1937    Telemac's struggles to register his children speak of the program's manifold failures  Authorities want statements from the mayor of Telemac's town and from the midwife who helped his wife deliver their children  The trips from his remote village to try to win approval  he says  are taxing his meager finances   Life without the card means restricted access to work  travel  and education  It also means constantly having to bribe the notoriously corrupt Dominican police every time they are encountered or risk getting thrown onto a bus and deported  Telemac says he's simply fighting for his children's fair share  He's frustrated by all the red tape but determined to get the documents   Analuisa Jean  a thin 33 year old mother of two who was born in the Dominican Republic  says that over the past year and a half  conditions in Parc Cadeau have deteriorated  Food has gotten scarcer  Doctors have stopped visiting  Fuel for cooking has become more expensive  And every month or two  someone's hut burns down because they got distracted while tending a fire   Still  Jean rejects the idea of returning to the Dominican Republic  even if the situation is bleak   I was raised there  had my kids there  but I would never go back   She says people in the town of Pedernales threw rocks at her children one morning in June 2015 as they were walking to school  Those people were her neighbors  She says the border police summarily deported friends and family members  and some of her relatives were even beaten   Unlike most other residents of Parc Cadeau  Jean lived just outside Pedernales  in a neighborhood slightly north of the town  Her old house sat directly across the river from the refugee camp  only a half hour walk away  She says that in June 2015   things got so bad I couldn't even get to work  So we fled    She and her children walked to Haiti one afternoon  crossing the shallow Pedernales River on foot  Though she is now free from the threat of persecution at the hands of vigilantes and Dominican border authorities  Jean is less than sanguine about her new life in Haiti   Here  there's no work  Here  we're surviving by the grace of God  ",

        "body0": "Sean M  Haffey Getty Images  While the Miami Dolphins reportedly want to re sign wide receiver Kenny Stills  a new report suggests he is leaning toward signing elsewhere in free agency   According to Armando Salguero of the Miami Herald  the Dolphins are hoping to make a pitch to Stills this week  but sources believe he is more likely to test the free agent waters   Per Salguero  Stills is expected to command around  12 million per season on the open market  a price Miami is unwilling to pay   A receiver needy team such as the Philadelphia Eagles may be in the hunt  however  Eliot Shorr Parks of NJ com reported their interest in Stills  and Salguero confirmed it   The 24 year old Stills is coming off arguably his best season  as he reeled in 42 receptions for 726 yards and a career high nine touchdowns   Miami acquired him from the New Orleans Saints prior to the 2015 season  and while Stills' first campaign with the Dolphins was a struggle to the tune of just 440 yards and three touchdowns  he became a key part of the offense in 2016   Stills is a good fit in Miami since he is among the NFL's most dangerous deep threats  which allows Pro Bowl receiver Jarvis Landry to do damage underneath defenses   The 2013 fifth round pick out of Oklahoma was only third on the team in receiving yardage last season  though  behind both Landry and DeVante Parker   If Parker continues to make strides and Miami manages to find a cheaper deep option either through the draft or free agency  it may be able to let Stills walk without experiencing too much of a drop off ", 
        "body2": "Retaining wide receiver Kenny Stills is the Miami Dolphins  primary offseason goal  or so they say   But the pending free agent is not guaranteed to return next season  with teams inevitably scouting for deep field threats  as a Friday report has already noted   Stills  market value has been estimated at anywhere from  25 million to  30 million over a four  or five year contract  according to Spotrac and other sources  Theoretically  those are numbers the Dolphins could find reasonable  but if another team comes forward with a larger offer  he s likely to accept it   What would that mean for the Dolphins  passing offense   It wouldn t be good  Stills was Miami s third most productive pass catcher  covering 726 yards through the air  and was their most prolific scorer  with nine receiving touchdowns  His 17 3 yards on average per catch was not only a team high  but the NFL s third best mark overall  surpassed only by four tenths of a yard behind DeSean Jackson and Chris Hogan   Surveying the Dolphins  receiving depth chart reveals enviable talent  but Stills  most pronounced skill  the long play that can split a secondary in two  is not prominent among the other members  Jarvis Landry is a yards after the catch fixture from the slot  but not known as a high volume scorer  DeVante Parker can be special  and was their second best yard gainer  but he was also slowed by injuries to his hamstring and back last summer   Otherwise  Miami relies on unproven rookie Leonte Carroo  and a decent cadre of tight ends and assorted tailbacks to provide an extra push as pass receivers   Losing Stills is obviously not an ideal solution  and it s one the Dolphins are currently formulating plans to avoid  And though there would be a few options to consider in the draft  the team would do better to use their picks to address other  more pressing needs  and stick with the player they know has proven success ", 
        "body1": "Which wide receiver should the Eagles sign in 2017 NFL free agency  DeSean Jackson or Kenny Stills   As the Philadelphia Eagles are gearing up for the 2017 free agency period  which begins on March 9 at 9 p m  ET  tampering period starts March 7   there is a big debate for many fans and analysts  Should the Eagles should target wide receiver DeSean Jackson over wide receiver Kenny Stills  or should they target Stills over Jackson   Without football being on  the debate has helped filled a void that many are missing  but in my opinion  that is all this is just a football debate to fill a void  I feel that targeting Jackson over Stills is a no brainer  Let s start debunking the theory that the Eagles need to target Stills over Jackson   Stills is entering his fifth year in the NFL and has never had 1 000 or more yards in a season  His highest total  913  came in 2014 with the New Orleans Saints  who traded Stills before the 2015 season for a third round pick to the Miami Dolphins  That mean if Stills signs with someone other than the Saints or the Dolphins  he will play for three teams in five years  You have to assume that  if Stills was an elite talent or teams saw elite potential in his game  he would not be in this scenario   Staying on Stills  he has never caught more than 50 passes in a season and outside of that 2014 seasons when he caught 63 passes  Stills  next highest total was 42 receptions  The former Dolphin s longest touchdown of his career was 76 yards  So why are Eagles fans and analysts thinking Stills is the guy the Eagles should target instead of Jackson   His career yards per reception is impressive  sitting at 16 7 and he is coming off of a career high nine touchdown season in 2016  Stills averaged 17 3 yards per reception and was a solid deep threat for the Dolphins this past season  However  those aren t the numbers that people put the most weight into  At just 24 years old  though  the thought is that the young player is getting ready to hit his prime and have a breakout season   The argument is that the 30 year old Jackson will start to decline while the 24 year old Stills will start to rise  It makes sense if this were a video game  In a perfect world  the younger player will start to perform better than the older player  but you need grounds and factual evidence to support the claim that Stills will be a better asset than Jackson  However  the numbers and facts just aren t there   Jackson has played nine NFL seasons and has gone over 1 000 yards five times  That means Stills will need to go over 1 000 yards  something he has never done  for the next four seasons to match Jackson  He has also caught over 50 passes six times in his career  and did so in three out of his first four seasons in the NFL  grabbing 47 in the year he failed to reach that mark   Hearing this  people will say that was over Jackson s career  but now it is about the present and the future  Well  last season Jackson caught 52 passes for 1 005 yards and four scores  He did that in 15 games  one less than Stills  and he averaged 17 9 yards per catch  best in the NFL  So  in present time  Jackson remains better than Stills   In the last four seasons  the first four seasons for Stills  2013 16   Jackson has more receptions  yards  and touchdowns than Stills  He also averages more yards per reception than Stills and has an impressive 19 yards per receptions rate over his last three years   Saying the Eagles should target Stills over Jackson sounds good  but the facts prove otherwise  Outside of age  why would the Eagles want Stills over Jackson  Even if Jackson slows down in two or three years  those are two or three years of elite play by a guy who will be in the Hall of Fame when he s done playing   By signing Jackson over Stills  the Eagles get a sure fire deep threat and someone who will stretch the field for their offense  It gives their franchise quarterback Carson Wentz a veteran target that he can trust  Signing Stills does the complete opposite  It guarantees nothing and  if Stills does what he has been doing so far in his career  Wentz would have another mediocre wide receiver that he can t depend on   If the future is what many people are putting weight on  the arrow still points to Jackson being the better option over Stills  The numbers and facts don t lie  and Jackson is the wide receiver the Eagles should target when free agency opens  not Stills ",

        "body1": "The case against a St  Anthony police officer who fatally shot Philando Castile during a traffic stop this past summer is heading to trial   In an order issued Wednesday afternoon  Ramsey County District Judge William Leary denied a defense motion to have the charges against Jeromino Yanez dismissed on the grounds they lacked probable cause   Defense attorneys also argued that Castile was high on marijuana when Yanez shot him  making the 32 year old black man culpable in his own death   Leary found that prosecutors had met the legal threshold necessary to move forward    This court concludes that the evidence  as interpreted by the state  is substantial enough to create a likelihood that  if the state s interpretation is accepted by a jury  the state could prevail   the order reads   Consequently  it is fair and reasonable to allow this matter to proceed to trial    Leary went on to write that the defense s argument that Castile was somehow to blame for his death because he was high had  failed     A victim s unreasonable conduct is never an absolute defense to a criminal charge   the order said   The judge issued his decision hours after a Wednesday morning hearing on the motion drew supporters for both Castile and Yanez to the Ramsey County Courthouse   Leary gave defense attorney Paul Engh the first opportunity to present reasons for asking for the dismissal during the proceeding  Assistant U S  Attorney Jeffrey Paulsen countered with arguments on why the case should go to trial   Chief among the defense s position  Engh argued  was that the charges lacked probable cause because Yanez had acted within the rights afforded him as a police officer when he made the decision to fire at Castile July 6   As a police officer  Engh said Yanez had the right to be carrying a gun that night  the right to stop Castile for his vehicle s broken tail light  the right to have his orders obeyed  and the right to shoot when he felt his life was in danger   The defense further argued that Castile was high at the time and therefore had no right to be driving a vehicle or carrying a gun  His impairment made him culpable in his death  Engh argued   Related Articles St  Anthony officer expected to plead not guilty in Castile shooting  Plan to attend the Philando Castile cop shooting trial  What you need to know  New memorial planned near site of Castile shooting  Cop who shot Philando Castile  indeed saw gun   his attorneys say Prosecutors maintained that there are numerous  facts in dispute  in the case that should be left for a jury to decide   Among them  Paulsen said prosecutors disagree with the defense statement that Castile was reaching for his gun when Yanez shot him seven times  Instead he was reaching for his wallet to comply with Yanez s request to see his driver s license  he argued   Further  he disputed the claim that Yanez actually saw Castile s gun  pointing out that when first interviewed after the shooting  Yanez reportedly said   I don t know where the gun was    He also said that  while Castile was found to have had THC   an active ingredient in marijuana   in his system at the time of his death  Castile was not  impaired  at the time of the traffic stop  He added that video captured of the incident backs that up   He also argued against the defense s claim that Castile s use of marijuana could somehow negate his right not to be recklessly shot by a police officer    The central question in this case  is not whether  Castile  had a right to carry a gun   it was his right not to be killed for no good reason   Paulsen said   He added that Yanez s subjective opinion that he faced a threat to his life was not an adequate defense  Instead  he said the legal standard is based on the  objective  assessment of what a  reasonable officer  would do under the same circumstances    If all  a police officer  had to do is say   I felt threatened and you have to believe me  Judge   there would never be a prosecution  in these cases     That s what a trial is for   Paulsen said   The St  Anthony police officer was charged in November with one count of second degree manslaughter and two felony counts of dangerous discharge of a firearm for fatally shooting Castile during a July 6  2016  traffic stop in Falcon Heights  Castile was in the car at the time with his girlfriend and her young child   Yanez wore a beige suit at the hearing  Sitting next to his team of attorneys  he said nothing during the roughly 40 minute proceeding   Earl Gray  another of Yanez s defense attorneys  said that while the defense had hoped to win its motion Wednesday  he was still confident Yanez would prevail at trial    Before you can be convicted  a jury has to find unanimously that your client is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt   Gray said   Well  I believe that when we present the  findings  about Castile s conduct that night compared with our client s  I don t think it will take a jury long to find that the state has failed miserably to prove their case beyond a reasonable doubt    Some of Yanez s fellow officers  including the St  Anthony police chief  attended the Wednesday hearing   Castile s family and friends took up two rows inside the courtroom   His mother  Valerie Castile  said afterword that the future of the case is  in God s hands   and reiterated the integrity of her son and the depth of loss she and her loved ones have had to carry since his death    He was an amazing human being   she said   Castile graduated from Central High School in 2001  He was a longtime employee for the St  Paul school district  where he worked in an elementary school as a kitchen supervisor  He had never been convicted of a felony in Minnesota   Yanez  who is Latino  is married with one child  The 28 year old became a licensed police officer in 2011 and joined the St  Anthony Police Department about four years ago   He has no record of complaints against him in his personnel file   The next hearing in the case is scheduled for Feb  27  Yanez is expected to enter a plea during the proceeding ",

        "body2": "The accountancy firm in charge of the Oscars results has apologized after Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway were handed the wrong results card when announcing the Best Picture award and incorrectly announced La La Land as the winner rather than Moonlight   The apology came in statement released by accounting firm PwC  formerly Price Waterhouse Coopers  hours after the Academy Awards ended on Sunday night   The statement said  'We sincerely apologize to Moonlight  La La Land  Warren Beatty  Faye Dunaway  and Oscar viewers for the error that was made during the award announcement for Best Picture   'The presenters had mistakenly been given the wrong category envelope and when discovered  was immediately corrected  We are currently investigating how this could have happened  and deeply regret that this occurred   'We appreciate the grace with which the nominees  the Academy  ABC  and Jimmy Kimmel handled the situation '  In a heart stopping moment  the stars and producers of La La Land were stopped midway through their acceptance speeches and forced to hand their trophies to the stars of Moonlight after their film was announced as Best Picture in one of the biggest blunders in Oscar history   Warren Beatty was forced to explain the mishap as the cast of La La Land handed over their Oscars to the producers of Moonlight on stage  The terrible end to an otherwise triumphant show left the audience gasping in horror as Beatty revealed he had incorrectly read La La Land as the winner   Accountancy firm PricewaterhouseCoopers's Brian Cullinan and Martha Ruiz were in charge of this year's top secret Academy Awards results  They're posed together above with the two sets of envelopes  which are carried in briefcases  As the La La Land cast were walking on stage to accept the accolade  a stagehand standing in the wings could be heard saying 'Oh     Oh my god  he got the wrong envelope' and walking back and forth  according to the LA Times   While still on stage  Beatty blamed the epic mishap on being given the wrong envelope  saying he had seen the name Emma Stone from 'La La Land' when he opened his envelope   'I want to tell you what happened I opened the envelope and it said Emma Stone  La La Land and that is why I took such a long look at Faye and at you  I wasn't trying to be funny  This is Moonlight for best picture ' Beatty told the shocked crowd as he explained the blunder   An investigation is continuing into how La La Land was wrongly named Best Picture rather than the triumphant Moonlight   Only two people know the Oscars winners list and supervise the counting procedures   PwC tax adviser Martha Ruiz and Brian Cullinan an accountant who is the chairman of PwC's US board   Just days before the showcase event  they told the Huffington Post that they were unsure of the exact procedure in the event that the wrong actor or film was named as a winner in any given category since such a mistake had never been made in the awards' 88 year history   Cullinan and Ruiz each carry a suitcase containing a copy of the winning envelope for all the categories   meaning there are two envelopes for each award   There are duplicate envelopes for every category and Beatty was given the Best Actress duplicate envelope for best actress  with the category ACTRESS IN A LEADING ROLE clearly printed on the outside  La La Land producer Jordan Horowitz held up the correct envelope with Moonlight written on it as Warren Beatty stood behind him  before he graciously passed his statue to the Moonlight producers  The pair stand on opposite sides backstage and memorize the winners to avoid having to write them down and have revealed in the past how they carry out rigorous checks to ensure they have stuffed the envelopes correctly   It is believed Ruiz and Cullinan are ordered to destroy the duplicate cards as the presentation goes on  so by the time Best Picture is awarded  the only envelopes left are the two for Best Picture  according to Free Press   When Beatty and Dunaway took the stage to announce the Best Picture award  Cullinan and Ruiz realized that they still had two best picture envelopes  meaning that the envelope taken on stage was a duplicate for an award that had already been announced   It is unknown why there was still a Best Actress duplicate available when Beatty walked on stage   Executives from PwC immediately realized there was a problem  but they were too late to rectify the mistake as Dunaway read out the name La La Land from a card that was meant to be for the Best Actress award  which Emma Stone won for her role in the film earlier in the night   After the officials realized what had happened  they tried to get on stage immediately  But the news was broken to the La La Land cast and crew after they had started their acceptance speeches   La La Land producer Jordan Horowitz returned to the microphone after being told about the mix up and said 'Moonlight won Best Picture' and insisting that 'this is not a joke'   Faye Dunaway and Warren Beatty walk on stage to present the award for Best Picture  The pair's appearance at the show is meant to be a triumphant reunion to mark the 50th anniversary of 1967's Bonnie And Clyde  Beatty opens the envelope  sees the words 'Emma Stone from La La Land' and confusion spreads across his face  He looks to Dunaway  who reads out 'La La Land' as the Best Picture winner  La La Land producers Jordan Horowitz and Fred Berger  left  arrive on stage to accept the award from Dunaway and Beatty as the cast and crew follow suit  La La Land producer Jordan Horowitz accepts the award and and thanks his cast and crew after being announced Best Picture  Suddenly  a backstage official with a headset rushes on to the stage to correct the mishap  He arrives with a new envelope  with the correct details inside  He came on stage after executives from PwC  who tally the Oscar results  realized there was a problem when Dunaway read out the name La La Land  A shocked Horowitz and Jimmy Kimmel react as Beatty reveals the correct winner to him midway through his acceptance speech  It has since emerged that there are duplicate envelopes for every category and Beatty was given the Best Actress duplicate envelope by mistake  Horowitz presents the envelope reading 'Moonlight' as the winner as he calls up the producers of the film to graciously pass over his statue  La La Land's Horowitz invites the Moonlight cast and crew on stage as Beatty explains that he had received the wrong results envelope from officials  Beatty tells the crowd that the card he received had Emma Stone's name in it  because it was a card for Best Actress instead of Best Picture  Beatty explains how he read the incorrect card to the crowd as shocked cast and crew from La La Land and Moonlight stand behind him  Horowitz embraces Jenkins on stage and hands over his Oscar after the revelation that it belonged to the Moonlight director  Writer and director of Moonlight  Barry Jenkins  holds his Oscar and speaks to the crowd after being awarded the Best Picture Academy Award  Beatty and Dunaway arrive at an Academy Awards after party following the chaotic ceremony  Beatty brought the Best Actress card to the party with him following the mishap  When Jenkins finally receives his Oscar  the director has the trophy engraved backstage  a tradition that follows each presentation  Just seconds before  confusion was etched across Beatty's face after he opened the envelope  He took a second glance inside the winner's envelope before showing it to Dunaway who mistakenly thought he was asking her to read out La La Land   'It's one of the strangest things that's ever happened to me ' Beatty said backstage  'Thank God there were two of us up there ' Dunaway responded   The actress then asked Beatty  'Who else should I tell '  'Everybody ' he said   At that point  a security guard tried to take the real envelope and Beatty said  'Security is not getting this  I'm giving it to  Moonlight director  Barry Jenkins at a later time ' Beatty also refused to show it to anyone else   ABC News  tweeting about the ceremony broadcast on its network  said the envelope held by Beatty read  'Actress in a leading role ' A close up photo of Beatty onstage verified that   PwC has counted votes and provides winner envelopes for the Oscars and has done so for more than 80 years   This is the first time in Oscar history that the wrong envelope had been opened while an award was being announced   Host Jimmy Kimmel came forward to inform the cast that Moonlight had indeed won  showing the inside of the envelope as proof   La La Land producer Jordan Horowitz immediately called up the producers of Moonlight and graciously passed his statue over   'I knew I would screw this up ' Kimmel  a first time host  joked  'I promise to never come back '  Academy president Cheryl Boone Isaacs said Academy officials met with PriceWaterhouseCooper to figure out exactly what had happened when Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway were given a duplicate envelope containing Emma Stone's best actress win   Moonlight's director Barry Jenkins told the crowd  'Very clearly even in my dreams this can't be true  But to hell with it because this is true  It's true  it's not fake '  Even though it wasn't strictly speaking Beatty's fault  he exited the Dolby Theatre through a back exit to avoid press   He later told the Daily Mail the reason he paused for so long was because he knew there was a problem   Emma Stone posed backstage with Leonardo DiCaprio after accepted her Oscar  She can be seen holding her envelope underneath her arm  The 79 year old made a surprise appearance at the after party still clutching the wrong envelope in his hand  Golden girl  Emma Stone was also a first time winner as she was crowned Best Actress for her work in La La Land  Excited  The 41 year old actor was obviously overcome with emotion  Respect  His big brother Ben congratulated Casey with hugs and kisses  'People thought I was being dramatic but I wasn't   There was something wrong   I showed it to Faye and she said La La Land ' Beatty said   The Moonlight director Jenkins said backstage  'I noticed the commotion that was happening and I thought that something strange had occurred   'The last 20 minutes of my life have been insane '  He added  'It made a very special feeling even more special  but not in the way I expected '  A crazy  stupid moment  Ryan Gosling guffawed on stage after learning La La Land was not really the best picture winner at the Academy Awards on Sunday  He told reporters he had not been given a formal explanation but he understood that mistakes happen   'I will say  I saw two cards  and so things just happen ' Jenkins said  'I wanted to see the card    and Warren refused to show the card to anybody before he showed it to me  And so he did  He came upstairs and he walked over to me  and he showed the card   'Everyone was asking  'Can I see the card ' And he was like  'No  Barry Jenkins has to see the card  I need him to know'  And I felt better about what had happened '  He said that cast and crew of La La Land were 'so gracious' during the mayhem   'I can't imagine being in their position and having to do that ' he said   Meanwhile  Emma Stone  with her Best Actress Oscar in hand  told Daily Mail that she was 'distraught ' over the best picture screw up   'Wow   Its horrible ' she said of the monumental flap over the wrong film being announced as best picture   The star of La La Land said she wasn't aware until later that there were duplicate envelopes for every Oscar category   She said that she had the envelope for her win as best actress for La La Land  ' I didn't know until now that they have two of everything '  After the ceremony mix up  Beatty and Dunaway made a surprise appearance at the Governors Ball   the official after party   The 79 year old entered the party still clutching the wrong envelope in his hand   The ceremony's chaotic scene immediately raced to the top of all time Oscar moments  far more stunning than the nude man who raced across the stage in 1974 as part of the 'streaking' fad   City Of Stars  La La Land swept the original music categories as Justin Hurwitz  Justin Paul  and Benj Pasek   pictured from left to right   accepted gongs  Crowning achievement  Viola Davis won her first Oscar ever in the Best Actress in a Supporting Role category for Fences  Aww  Viola was congratulated by co star Denzel Washington  And it immediately evoked Steve Harvey's recent gaffe of naming the wrong Miss Universe winner   The Miss Universe Twitter account quickly let the Oscars know they felt their pain   'Have your people call our people  we know what to do ' the tweet read   That was the beginning of a Tweet pile on that may be the biggest of all time  with many declaring that 'La La Land' won the popular vote while 'Moonlight' won the electoral college   But this stage  and this audience  were far  far bigger and are likely to last far  far longer in collective memory   The unbelievable mishap came at the end of an otherwise flawless evening  which saw Casey Affleck and Emma Stone take home their first Oscar   Affleck won Best Actor for Manchester By The Sea  while Stone was crowned Best Actress for her work in La La Land   Just before that  Damien Chazelle won Best Director for La La Land  The musical had already won four other gongs at the event held at the Dolby Theater   It is already tied for most nominations of all time and swept the original music categories as well as Best Production Design and Cinematography   Before Chazelle's win  Viola Davis took home her first ever Oscar when she was crowned Best Supporting Actress for her role in Fences   The 51 year old star gave an impassioned speech about being an actress at the event held at the Dolby Theater in Hollywood on Sunday night   Big win  Mahershala Ali won the first gong of the night in the Best Supporting Actor role for Moonlight  Showing respect  At the very beginning of his acceptance he said his grandmother would tell him to button up his tuxedo jacket so he did so  Viola had tears in her eyes as she said  'I became an artist  and thank God I did  because we are the only profession that celebrates what it means to live a life '  It was also a crowning achievement as she became the first black actor to ever receive an Oscar  Emmy  and a Tony   Earlier in the night  Mahershala Ali took home the gong for Best Supporting Actor for his role in Moonlight    The 43 year old Oakland  California  native made sure to button up his tuxedo as he said his grandmother would tell him to do so   Ali had a very poignant moment during his speech as he talked about being an actor by explaining  'It's not about you  it's about these characters  you are a servant '  The directors of Zootopia proudly accepted the Best Animated Feature Film gong   One even got political during the acceptance speech as they talked about the theme of the movie as they said  'Zootopia is a story of tolerance being more powerful than fear of the other '  The ceremony was kicked off by an entertaining performance by Justin Timberlake as sang his Trolls hit Can't Stop The Feeling   Then came out host Jimmy Kimmel  who immediately

chance to beat the record 11 Oscars that have been won by Ben Hur  Titanic and The Lord of the Rings  The Return of the King   Its ten other nominations came in nine categories   Oscars host Kimmel

speeches dominated the Oscars on Sunday night with winners lining up to outdo each other as they spoke out against President Donald Trump's immigration ban  Oscars host Jimmy Kimmel kicked things off when he fired several shots at Trump during his opening monologue  But as the night progressed  actors  directors and designers quickly started dedicating their Academy Awards to 'the immigrants'  spoke out against the Mexican wall and went as far as calling Trump's immigration policy 'inhumane'  While Alessandro Bertolazzi is not a well known name outside the film industry  the makeup artist was the first Oscar winner to mention politics in his acceptance speech  The Italian dedicated his win in the makeup and hair styling category to 'all the immigrants'  Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway  stars of 1967's classic Bonnie and Clyde  presented the Oscar for best picture  'Our goal in politics is the same in our goal in art  and that's to get to the truth ' Beatty said on stage  Iranian director Asghar Farhadi took home the Academy Award for best foreign film for his drama The Salesman  The director had previously said he was not attending the Oscars in revolt against Trump's

throughout her career   'One actress has stood the test of time for her many uninspiring and overrated performances ' Kimmel said  'This is Meryl's 20th Oscar nomination    she wasn't even in a movie

        "body1": "Transition  States  rights used to be a conservative value  In the Trump age  it s a liberal one   It s widely known that the Trump administration has overturned Obama era protections for transgender students  It s less well known that the way it did so  emphasizing states  rights  was a gigantic tactical mistake that is going to blow up in their faces   The substantive issue is whether transgender students in public schools should be allowed to use gender appropriate restrooms  or whether schools may require them to use single stall bathrooms or those corresponding to the students  biological sex at birth   Legally speaking  there are two avenues in which this debate is moving forward  First are two  guidance letters  by the Education Department  stating that Title IX which prohibits discrimination in educational contexts based on sex covers trans students as well  and requires schools to let them use gender appropriate restrooms  That letter didn t have the force of law  but because the DoE could withhold funds from non conforming school districts  it did wield the power of the purse strings   Those letters were officially retracted in a February 22 letter by the civil rights directors of the Education and Justice Departments   But there s also the second legal avenue  which is a case brought by the ACLU on behalf of Gavin Grimm  a transgender student in Virginia a case that will be argued at the Supreme Court on March 28  In that case  G G  v  Gloucester County School Board  the Court is set to decide the same question  whether Title IX covers trans people   In that regard  the February 22 letter is extremely odd  It doesn t take a position on Title IX  instead saying that the government needs more time to  further and more completely consider the legal issues involved   And it adds  echoing President Trump s statements  that  there must be due regard for the primary role of the States and local school districts in establishing educational policy    That was a huge mistake  for three reasons   First  the administration missed the opportunity to tell the Supreme Court its interpretation of Title IX  Earlier in the litigation  courts had deferred to the Obama administration s interpretation  But with that gone  the Supreme Court now has   nothing    We don t really know the government s position on Title IX   said Joshua Block  the ACLU s lead lawyer  in a press call discussing the G G  case   Technically  their position is neutral    That s exactly right  And while the new government s position isn t technically part of the G G  litigation  its February 22 letter practically begs the Court to weigh in   It wouldn t have been hard to simply take the opposite view  True  the new administration has only been in office a month  but that s certainly not stopped them from taking bold positions on immigration  national security  and a myriad of other issues  Moreover  they re not working on a blank slate  Conservatives  and one district court  have articulated anti trans interpretations of Title IX for years   Here  I ll articulate one right now  Title IX is about sex discrimination  and was passed in 1972  The term  transgender  wasn t invented until 1975  and there s not a scintilla of evidence that Congress had anything like it in mind  Anyway  sex and gender are different things  This is a massive expansion of legislation that is totally unjustified by the statute or its legislative history   That wasn t hard to say and yet the Trump administration chose not to say it  abdicating legal ground that it could easily have occupied   Second  emphasizing states  rights is incoherent  Said Block   sex discrimination in public schools hasn t been left up to the states since 1972  That s why Title IX was passed  The federal government said that it is going to protect everyone no matter what state they live in    That  too  is exactly right  Like it or not  the whole point of federal legislation on civil rights is to take primacy over states  rights  That  unlike the question of transgender equality  is in the statutory history of Title IX  and it s absurd to argue  states  rights  against a law that understands states  rights quite clearly  and deliberately takes precedence over them   Get The Beast In Your Inbox  Daily Digest Start and finish your day with the top stories

to other Trump administration initiatives  such as its crackdown on marijuana users and its fight against  sanctuary cities   In those and other contexts  the government is directly opposing states  rights  usurping criminal law and threatening cities with bankruptcy if they allocate their own resources in a way the federal government dislikes   Indeed  the last month has seen a reversal of the usual federalist dynamic  For two centuries during the Civil War  the New Deal  the Civil Rights movement  and in countless contemporary contexts from environmental law to interstate commerce conservatives have waved the banner of states  rights  while liberals have opposed them  It s in conservatives  DNA  It s why the conservative legal network is called  The Federalist Society   It s why Governor George Wallace stood in that schoolhouse door  opposing a federal desegregation order   But now  the shoe is on the other foot  Now it s progressive states and localities arguing states  rights  and the federal government opposing them  The case that halted Trump s travel ban was called Washington v  Trump and was filed by the state of Washington against the federal government   Sanctuary cities  rely on the longstanding priority given to local authorities for local law enforcement   The term is really a misnomer  since generally  it only means that local officials won t cooperate with federal immigration actions not that they will oppose them   We re sure to see much more of this  particularly from blue states and cities   Attorney General Jeff Sessions  who spearhead the effort to overturn the transgender protections  is from a generation for whom states  rights and conservative resistance to civil rights were synonymous  But now  states  rights are more about liberal resistance to the Trump administration  The same values that his department s letter is promoting are opposed by the administration itself ",

Barnum   Bailey  will hold its final performances in May of this year  Ringling Bros  ticket sales have been declining  but following the transition of the elephants off the road  we saw an even more dramatic drop  This  coupled with high operating costs  made the circus an unsustainable business for the company   Nearly 50 years ago  my father founded our company with the acquisition of Ringling Bros  The circus and its people have continually been a source of inspiration and joy to my family and me  which is why this was such a tough business decision to make  The decision was even more difficult because of the amazing fans that have become part of our extended circus family over the years  and we are extremely grateful to the millions of families who have made Ringling Bros  part of their lives for generations  We know Ringling Bros  isn t only our family business  but also your family tradition   Ringling Bros  and Barnum   Bailey  Presents Circus XTREME will conclude its tour

Death  in 2014    As Was  is an album that is atmospheric and melodic without relenting on any of the ferocity the band is known for  It is more diverse  complex  and thought provoking than anything the group has previously recorded    We started working on the album a little over a year ago   said Delaney  during a phone interview Wednesday afternoon from a tour stop in Washington  D C    We recorded at Menegroth in Queens and it was mixed and mastered in Sweden by Tore Stjerna at Necromorbus Studio in Stockholm  He s just someone we knew would make the album sound like we wanted  We just left it in his hands    We did some overdubbing when we were recording  You do as much as you can live and then add whatever else it needs  This was the first time we used this studio and we were very happy with it    Delaney spoke of the differences the new album has from its predecessors    This album is a lot more refined   said Delaney   It came together differently  We just sort of trimmed the fat and made it come together  We knew where we wanted to go  We wanted to keep it a lot simpler and  at the same time  more musical  We wanted to be more creative and take more chances  And  there is a lot more singing on it    We did what we wanted and if some fans don t like the direction we moved  the hell with them  At the end of the day  we re happy with it  It was a huge success    We re at the end of this tour and then we ll start again soon  We ll be touring most of the year  This whole cycle we ll be playing new stuff and that s fine  I can t say we re a band that has hits or other

Beethoven are out on a limited run East Coast tour performing a series of  Resonance Field Tests    The idea behind the  tests   presented in the form of dance concerts  stems from the growing theory

being stagnant museum pieces preserved lifelessly behind glass in seated and stuffy institutions   Reed Mathis   Electric Beethoven are taking this music back to the streets  performing ritualistic

cast with Catharine Slusar  Trevor William Fayle  Sean Bradley  Molly Ward  Amy Frear and Susanne Collins    We have a cast of six and it really is an ensemble piece   said Ward  during a phone interview Tuesday afternoon during a break between tech and a dress rehearsal   My character is Maggie and it is more from her perspective    It s set in the present time in Manchester  New Hampshire  It s about one family   a blue collar New Hampshire family dealing with a missing teenage daughter during a blizzard    Filled with poignant passions  plot twists and dark humor   Lost Girls  is both a tense family drama and a moving teenage love story  When Erica  their 16 year old daughter  goes missing during a winter storm  Maggie and Lou former high school sweethearts  now divorced are forced to confront the legacy of their past decisions    When Erica is lost  we all come together at my mother s house   my ex Lou  His wife Penny  my mother Linda and me   said Ward   We are dealing with the fact that we might have lost her    It s a non traditional family having to deal with each other  My mother is a fantastic comic matriarch   played by the fantastic Catharine Slusar  She is my grumpy  drunk mom and she s a force to be reckoned with    She was a single mom and so am I  We re two generations of unwed mothers  The show is about the struggle not to repeat mistakes our parents

 The show is directed by Exile s Founding Artistic Director Joe Canuso    I didn t know anything about  Lost Girls   when I auditioned   said Ward  a native of Mount Airy who just relocated to Philly after living in New York for 20 years  It was in New York right when I was leaving New York    I read it and it s a meaty actor s play  It s an old fashioned family play that is also dark and funny  It s really plot driven   and it flies by  It s extremely well paced  The script is a tight machine    Video link for Theatre Exile   https   youtu be evMxZpD9myE    Lost Girls  will run from February

Fortunately  area music fans don t have to travel all the way to the Big Easy to get in a Mardi Gras mood and groove to the sounds of New Orleans because the Ardmore Music Hall  23 East Lancaster Avenue  Ardmore  610 649 8389  www ardmoremusic com  is hosting the New Orleans Suspects on February 17   The New Orleans Suspects have only been in existence for slightly more than seven years but they are so tight musically  it would be easy to assume that they ve been making music together for decades   The band features Charlie Wooton on bass  Royal Southern Brotherhood  Sonny Landreth  Bonerama    Mean  Willie Green on drums  Neville Brothers   Jeff Watkins on saxophone  James Brown Band  Joss Stone Band   Jake Eckert on guitar and vocals  Dirty Dozen Brass Band  and CR Gruver on keyboards and vocals  Polytoxic  Outformation     We re still home   said Eckert  during a phone interview last week from his home in New Orleans   Our gear heads out tomorrow and we fly to New York City on Thursday  We ll do a short tour and then head home for Mardi Gras    Being home for Mardi Gras is very important to us  The carnival festivities kicked of last weekend and it just keeps ramping up  It lasts three weeks and each week gets progressively more intense  It s a full family tradition  The kids even have off from school the last week before Mardi Gras    The band s formation was very accidental  Hank Staples  the guy who runs the Maple Leaf  a popular New Orleans music club  occasionally had a band that doesn t show up  So  he kept a list of New Orleans musicians who he could call at the last minute    We all live right around the Maple Leaf   said Eckert  I was in the Dirty Dozen Brass Band  Willie was with the Nevilles and the Radiators were still in existence    Hank would call me whenever he needed a band at the last minute  We played a couple gigs together and people really enjoyed it  A few weeks later  Hank called again  Another few weeks later  he called again and said   can you put the usual suspects together to come play    The band began performing a couple times a month at the Maple Leaf and started hanging out at Eckert s place while he was building his studio  Before long  they were developing their own sound   It was a traditional sound within the realm of New Orleans funk   music like the early Meters  Earl King  Mardi Gras music  Professor Longhair  Dr  John and early Neville Brothers  Eckert also brought along a background in southern rock    As time went on  we started recording our first album   first as a demo and then it turned into a real album   said Eckert   That s when we changed our name to the New Orleans Suspects  Then  we started hitting the road    The next crossroad was when we picked up Jeff Watkins  He s a great saxophone player as well as an amazing engineer  He was the missing link    Watkins and Eckert produced and engineered the band s latest album  Ouroboros   They also did the mastering at Eckert s studio  which won a Grammy two years ago for its work with the North African band Tinariwen   According to the band s press release   Ouroboros   the band s third album  features fever inducing funk  irresistible R B rhythms  Longhair rhumbas  dancing in the street second lines  jazzy soul drenched horns  mind melting swamp hoodoo  and feet don t fail me now Carnivale music    We re working on our new album now   said Eckert   The last one and this one are all originals  There is zydeco  straight up New Orleans funk  Southern rock  Second Line tunes  a Mardi Gras Indian song and a song we made with Paul Barrere and Fred Tackett of Little Feat    The music has changed  At first  it was all these different styles come together  Now  it has its own sound  It s a strange gumbo but the sum of the parts is really good    The Mardi Gras vibe will be in full force at the Ardmore Music Hall Friday night with sets by Bonerama and the New Orleans Suspects    I love Mardi Gras   said Eckert   I ve got a seven year old and it s great for kids  What you see on TV with girls flashing their breasts on Bourbon Street and what actually happens are very different  Bourbon Street is for tourists    Uptown  where all the bands are from  it s a family thing with colors  costumes and cotton candy  We ll probably go to 10 12 parades  We ll be playing at the Maple Leaf for Lundi Gras  February 27

Eaglesmith released his debut album  Fred Eaglesmith  in 1980 and just released his latest album  Standard  on January 27   His bio offers this quick recap of his career as one of North America s premier songwriters    Start writing songs when you re 10 years old  Grow up with poverty  agriculture  religion  and eight siblings  Run away from home  Hop freight trains  Start a business  Lose a business  Struggle to get any gig  Drive to Nashville with no money and pockets full of songs  Get a record deal  Lose a record deal  Win a Juno Award  Break down on the side of the road every day for days on end  Become a cult hero and amass a following of self proclaimed  Fred Heads   Tour relentlessly  Become everyone s favorite  Becomes nobody s favorite  Follow your gut  Smarten up  Don t care what anybody thinks  Be fair  Be loyal no matter what  Keep going  Soften up  Give people a break  Expect nothing  Give everything  Keep going  Allow yourself to be happy  Find out who you are and deal with that  Don t stay in fancy hotels  Write good songs     I ve made 21 or 22 albums in 37 years   said Eaglesmith  during a phone interview Monday afternoon from a tour stop in Virginia  I had a vision when I was a kid that the career I m having was what would happen    At the end of the day  I did have sort of an idea that it would work out that way   me being an underground artist that gets some respect  At age 60  I m very alive and vibrant   very on fire with a lot of creativity  I m still on the road 200 days a year   and I m still an alternative thinker    Eaglesmith is a veteran of the music industry and at the same time is about as far away from actually participating in today s music industry as one could be  Never operating within anyone s boundaries  he continues to set the standard for independent artists everywhere   He tours endlessly   performing with his wife and musical partner Tif Ginn   Ginn is a gutsy singer and a transcendent songwriter who has spent most of her life touring and playing music  Her impressive  sultry vocals and glorious harmonies with Eaglesmith  along with her multiple instrument additions to the show  result in a perfect partnership   Eaglesmith s new album  Standard  shows that he is as on target as ever    I put the material together over a long time   said Eaglesmith    I get ideas and then try to get them to work  We cut the album at my home studio  We recorded it analog   and used a lot of tape    I wasn t trying to find a theme  I just wanted to create something of interest  It has a loose feel but it was a very hard album to record  It came out pretty simple but it was a very difficult record to make   to make it believable  It wasn t perfect in an era of perfect records    According to Eaglesmith   The album is more narrative than musical  The vocals have not been re tuned  either automatically or manually and sometimes they are a little sharp or flat  On some of the tracks you can hear the quiet hiss of reel to reel tape  It is a less than perfect album    Eaglesmith was well aware that many musicians sacrifice reality for perfection when making records   and that it was a path he did not want to follow    These days  you can fix everything but that s not what I wanted   said Eaglesmith   It s a hard decision because audiences are used to perfection    It s hard to decide what to leave in and what to take out  I make pretty lo fi records regularly  Anybody can make hi fi records  These guys were singing these songs   and they were real    Video link for Fred Eaglesmith   https

        "body2": "James Franco s screen adaptation of John Steinbeck s 1936 novel   In Dubious Battle   about striking California fruit pickers  is the farthest thing imaginable from the titillating provocations for which Mr  Franco is notorious  Along with his films based on William Faulkner s  As I Lay Dying  and  The Sound and the Fury   it belongs to the literary subgenre that might be called James Franco s eat your spinach movies   The first novel in Steinbeck s Dust Bowl trilogy  which also includes  Of Mice and Men  and  The Grapes of Wrath    In Dubious Battle  is Mr  Franco s stodgiest movie  a traditional historical drama replete with stale boilerplate dialogue and a choppy narration about the early days of the American labor movement  It was a time when striking workers risked brutal  sometimes murderous retaliation by greedy bosses and their rich cronies   Video  Directed by Mr  Franco from a screenplay by Matt Rager  who also wrote the script for Mr  Franco s  The Sound and the Fury    it stars Mr  Franco as Mac  a fiery union organizer who  with his much younger prot g   Jim Nolan  Nat Wolff   sets out to organize apple pickers in the fictional Torgas Valley of Central California   Mac is fiercely idealistic but unscrupulous  and Jim a starry eyed na f  Both belong to  The Party   read Communist   When the laborers learn that their promised pay has been reduced from  3 to  1 a day  they are ripe for the plucking as potential union members  Robert Duvall  with his usual aplomb  plays the evil landowner Bolton  who appears gun in hand with his posse   The rebellious fruit pickers are soon feuding among themselves  and before long organized protest morphs into dissension  chaos  arson and death  The movie s latter half is a mess  pivotal characters aren t properly introduced  and the rusty dialogue clanks so heavily you feel you are watching a vintage made for television movie    In Dubious Battle  wants to be a noble period piece in the mode of a John Sayles film like  Matewan   But it is too flat footed and sloppy to explore the obvious parallels between then and now  and the movie is peppered with gratuitous star cameos that distract rather than enlighten  At least it means well ",
