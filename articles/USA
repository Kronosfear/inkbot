        "body0": "One of the great mysteries of our time is why so few professionally funny people tend to be conservative. In the search for answers, you could do worse than to survey what conservatives find laughable. Some may point to Milo Yiannopoulos\u2019s faux-ironic shock humor as an example, or Piers Morgan\u2019s horrendous hackery, or the fact that a legion of Twitter Eggs had a huge guffaw when Donald Trump announced that while he used to call CNN Fake News, he now calls it Very Fake News. For a master's thesis in how conservative humor can fall flat, however, one need look no further than the transcendently unfunny Twitter feed of Mike Huckabee.\n\nMike Huckabee is a former Arkansas governor, multi-time presidential candidate and ersatz host of the Fox News talk show, Huckabee, which amazingly does not bear an exclamation point at the end. He's also the author of God, Guns, Grits and Gravy, a critical look at the all-time leading causes of death in the American South. See what just happened, just then? It was a joke. Not a great joke, by any means, but there was a set-up and a punchline and everything. Mike Huckabee probably wouldn't like that joke, but he's a big fan of the form itself\u2014not just hearing jokes, but making them too. Huck got jokes, alright. He's got so many of them. Mike Huckabee's main job these days seems to consist of armchair open mic-ing the events of the day.\n\nFor instance, it was a particularly big afternoon for the man who was once in charge of governing the state of Arkansas, as he livetweeted the Gorsuch confirmation hearing like it was the Golden Globes.\n\nEvery day is a day for topical jokes, though, when you're former presidential candidate and least funny person on Twitter, Mike Huckabee.\n\nIt wouldn't be so excruciating to read Huck's Twitter if it were merely filled with hacky dad jokes about the Super Bowl and daylight saving time, which it is. It\u2019s that his constant stabs at topical humor are coming from such a prominent person that they wind up in the overlapping echo chamber of both Media Twitter and Political Twitter. If you've spent time in either of those hallowed hellmouths, you know just how hard it is to stand out as being bad at making topical jokes. Huckabee always manages to make it look easy, though. Not only are his jokes unfunny, they're almost aggressively antifunny.\n\nIt\u2019s the smugness that's galling. Also the reiteration of far right talking points, officious deference to the president, and animosity toward traditional joke structure. For better or worse, people actually listen to this man. His words carry weight. So it\u2019s especially dispiriting that his terrible jokes also function as propaganda. He especially has a soft spot for reiterating how implausible it is that there is anything suspicious about either Russia or Trump\u2019s many, many connections to Russia, despite massive, mounting evidence to the contrary. Our president is under investigation by the FBI... and that\u2019s HILARIOUS.\n\nLike many amateur comedians, his sense of humor often leads to offense. He'll tweet using rap cadence, offending the sensibilities of anyone who has ever enjoyed even one Biggie bop. Or he'll insult the memory of slain trans martyr, Brandon Teena, achieving the impossible by briefly making Zach Braff look cool and spurring Cameron Esposito to raise thousands in Teena's honor with just one tweet.\n\nAlso, like most comedians and battle rappers, Huckabee has a sensitive spot that can be used against him, and frequently is. While insults about the sheer, mesmeric unfunniness of Huckabee\u2019s jokes always haunt his Twitter mentions, some of his critics prefer to get way more personal. These people will bring up the time that then-Governor Huckabee's son allegedly murdered a dog. It's an uber- , scorched earth reply that's haphazardly hurled at nearly all of Huckabee's tweets. The practiced may have reached its pinnacle the other day when he tweeted an epically awful joke involving dogs.\n\nWhether he deserves that kind of attack or not, one thing is for sure: Mike Huckabee is very bad at jokes. Of course, the worst part about his jokes, similar to Milo and other far-right funnymen is that when critics suggest they aren't funny, they insist that those those critics just aren't advanced enough as humans to get their jokes.\n\nTrust us, Mr. Huckabee, your humor is not over our heads\u2014it\u2019s beneath our contempt. Well, almost beneath it.",

Rick Scott faces term limits next year, a new poll shows Florida voters from both parties are undecided on who they want to replace him in Tallahassee.\n\nSt. Leo University released a poll of Floridians on Tuesday showing both Republicans and Democrats are not sure on who they want to be their gubernatorial candidates come 2018.\n\nA third of Florida Republicans--34 percent--are undecided on who they want to replace Scott while 30 percent are for former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, R-Ark., who moved to the Panhandle following his 2008 presidential bid. Huckabee has been active on the national stage since then, including hosting a national radio show and a TV show on Fox News. In 2016, Huckabee made a second presidential bid but fared far worse than he did in 2008, bowing out after a ninth place finish in the Iowa caucus which he won eight years before.\n\nFlorida Agriculture Commissioner Adam Putnam gets 13 percent of Florida Republicans while 6 percent former St. Petersburg Mayor Rick Baker. Florida House Speaker Richard Corcoran pulls 5 percent followed by state Sen. Jack Latvala with 3 percent. Physician Usha Jain, who ran for an Orange County Commission seat last year, gets 2 percent while 8 percent back other candidates. Jain is the only one of the Republicans included in the poll who has officially kicked off a gubernatorial bid.\n\nOn the other side of the aisle, 40 percent of Florida Democrats are unsure on who they are supporting for governor next year while 20 percent back former U.S. Rep. Patrick Murphy who was the party\u2019s unsuccessful candidate against U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., last year. Attorney John Morgan takes 9 percent followed by Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer with 6 percent. U.S. Rep. Kathy Castor and Miami Beach Mayor Phil Levine takes 5 percent apiece while two candidates based out of Tallahassee--former U.S. Rep. Gwen Graham and Mayor Andrew Gillum--claim 4 percent each. St. Petersburg Mayor Bob Buckhorn, who has said he will not run, gets 3 percent. Former state Sen. Jeremy Ring and Ft. Lauderdale Mayor Jack Seiler take 2 percent apiece while 4 percent prefer other candidates. So far Gillum and Orlando businessman Chris King, who was not included in the poll, have launched gubernatorial bids on the Democratic side.\n\nFrank Orlando, the director of the Saint Leo University Polling Institute, said name ID was in play in the early stages of the contest.\n\n\u201cThe biggest word in the gubernatorial race is still uncertainty\u2019,\u201d said Orlando. \u201cMost candidates are still doing their homework to decide if making a run is worth it. Until the field crystallizes, we\u2019ll continue to see results dominated by name ID.\u201d\n\nUndecided voters also came into play in the only hypothetical general election matchup conducted by St. Leo. While 26 percent of all voters were for Morgan and 20 percent for Putnam, 42 percent where undecided and 12 percent opted for other candidates.\n\nThe poll of 507 Floridians was conducted with an online survey instrument from March 3-11 and had a margin of error of +/- 4.5 percent.",

        "body1": "The Chicago Bulls regretfully announce that longtime Bulls executive Jerry Krause has passed away at the age of 77. Krause, the architect of Chicago\u2019s six World Championship teams, was a member of the Bulls\u2019 front office for 18 seasons (March 26, 1985 \u2013 April 7, 2003).\n\n\u201cThe entire Bulls organization is deeply saddened by the passing of Jerry Krause,\u201d said Chairman Jerry Reinsdorf. \u201cJerry was one of the hardest working guys I have ever been around, and he was one of the best talent evaluators ever. Jerry played an integral role in our run of six championships in eight years. He truly was the architect of all our great teams in the \u201990s. I would not have been elected to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame if it were not for Jerry. We will miss him tremendously, and we send our thoughts and prayers to his wife Thelma and the Krause family.\u201d\n\nKrause, a native of Chicago, took over Chicago\u2019s basketball operations department on March 26, 1985, following a successful run as a scout for the Baltimore Bullets, Phoenix Suns, Los Angeles Lakers and, previously, the Bulls (1969-71). During his NBA career, he was responsible for the drafting of future Hall of Famers Earl Monroe, Wes Unseld and Scottie Pippen. He also played a key role in the drafting of four NBA Rookie of the Year recipients in Monroe, Unseld, Alvin Adams and Elton Brand. In addition, Krause worked to select other NBA stars such as Jerry Sloan, Norm Van Lier, Clifford Ray, Michael Cooper and Norm Nixon.\n\nAmong the players he drafted for the Bulls were Pippen, Charles Oakley, Horace Grant, Stacey King, B.J. Armstrong, Toni Kukoc, Elton Brand, Ron Artest, Jamal Crawford and Tyson Chandler. Along with Michael Jordan, Pippen and Grant were the cornerstones of Chicago\u2019s first three-peat teams. From a free-agent standpoint, Krause complemented his rosters with the signings of John Paxson, Trent Tucker, Steve Kerr, Bill Wennington, Jud Buechler, Randy Brown, Ron Harper, Robert Parish, Brian Williams and countless others. He also traded for Bill Cartwright, Luc Longley and Dennis Rodman, who all played critical roles for Chicago\u2019s championship squads. Perhaps his greatest move was when he hired Phil Jackson from the Continental Basketball Association\u2019s Albany Patroons, first as an assistant coach and later as head coach of the Bulls. They formed the most successful executive and head coach duo in NBA history, as Chicago won six NBA titles in a span of eight seasons. Krause also hired assistant coaches Tex Winter, Johnny Bach, Jimmy Rodgers, Bill Cartwright and Frank Hamblen. For his efforts, he was named NBA Executive of the Year by his peers in 1987-88 and 1995-96. He also was honored by the Bulls when the team raised a banner in recognition of his many contributions on Oct. 31, 2003.\n\n\u201cI owe a lot to Jerry. If it weren\u2019t for him bringing me to Chicago in 1985, I probably never would have been a Bull,\u201d said Executive Vice President of Basketball Operations John Paxson. \u201cHe had a great eye for talent, and his ability to build a team is unrivaled. He\u2019s one of the best the league has ever seen. We\u2019re keeping Thelma and his family in our thoughts and prayers.\u201d\n\n\u201cJerry was a great basketball executive who I was fortunate to have worked for when I first joined the Bulls,\u201d said General Manager Gar Forman. \u201cFor those that did not know him, Jerry was an even better person. He was a quality human being who treated everyone great. He will be missed dearly. My thoughts and prayers go out to his family.\u201d\n\nKrause is survived by his wife, Thelma; his two children, Stacy and David; and, his grandchildren Colette, Josh, Mia and Riley.\n\nInformation related to a memorial service for Krause will be announced at a later date.",

Johnson of the Chicago Tribune.\n\nKrause took over as the Bulls' GM in 1985 and held the role until his retirement in 2003. His tenure included the franchise's unmatched success in the 1990s, which featured six NBA championships with the legendary tandem of head coach Phil Jackson and superstar Michael Jordan.\n\nJackson released a statement on Krause's death via the New York Knicks' PR team:\n\nThe Chicago native held various other roles during a lifetime commitment to sports. He worked as a scout for several NBA organizations before joining the Bulls and returned to scouting baseball prospects following his departure from the NBA.\n\nHis lasting legacy will always surround the roster he built around Jordan to make the Bulls one of the greatest dynasties in league history.\n\nWhether it was drafting Scottie Pippen in 1987 or acquiring the enigmatic Dennis Rodman in a 1995 trade with the San Antonio Spurs, Krause had an innate ability to pull the right strings at the perfect time to keep the Bulls on top.\n\nDavid Kaplan of CSN Chicago believes the end result is a Hall of Fame resume:\n\nAlthough the call from Springfield didn't arrive during his lifetime, he's still got a strong case to be inducted as a contributor.

The Boston pitcher was hard on himself after not covering first base on a grounder by Pittsburgh\u2019s Gift Ngoepe, leaving Sox second baseman Josh Rutledge no one to throw to on the play. The out would have ended the inning.\n\nSale was clearly upset with himself for not covering the bag, and when he got the ball back he used it to punch himself in the head. He said after the game it was a \u201cstupid mistake,\u201d and there\u2019s no excuse for making such a gaffe.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve done that 400,000 times since we\u2019ve been here, covering first base. I\u2019ve got to be better than that, even here,\u201d he told reporters after the outing. \u201cThere\u2019s no excuse for that at all.\u201d\n\nSale quickly retired the next patter, Pittsburgh pitcher Ivan Nova, with his third and final strikeout of the afternoon. He went four innings on Thursday, allowing three earned runs off seven hits and no walks.\n\nThose are not the results Sale wants whenever he toes the rubber, and despite feeling great during the start, he said locating his pitches was an issue.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t feel sharp today,\u201d Sale admitted. \u201cI felt great, just not sharp. I wasn\u2019t able to locate when I needed to.\u201d\n\nSale praised the Boston defense for giving him a much-needed boost as he struggled early on, and doesn\u2019t sound very concerned with what the Pirates were able to do against him in Thursday\u2019s exhibition. The results will matter much more in three weeks, when he makes his real Boston debut against Pittsburgh on April 5 at Fenway Park.\n\nAnd when that start rolls around, it\u2019s safe to bet there will be no brain cramps from the new Boston lefty.",

After a few questions, and generic answers regarding the outing, along came the topic of the mental miscue.\n\nThe result of that was a tone not normally found in March 16 spring training analysis.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s stupid,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019re here for.

Nwaba\u2019s stats may not jump off the sheet, but it is his presence on the floor and willingness to play hard-nosed defense every minute he\u2019s on the floor that has impressed the coaching staff.\n\nNwaba has become the Lakers\u2019 energy guy off the bench earning high praise from Walton and the guard\u2019s teammates on a nightly basis for his effort on the floor. It seems as though Walton may support the idea of keeping Nwaba for the rest of the season but bringing in another guard from the D-Fenders like Vander Blue or Josh Maggette may be the direction the team decides to take.\n\nNwaba\u2019s second 10-day contract with the team expires on Monday meaning he may have played his last game with the Lakers. Although his NBA journey may take a step back after Monday, the 23-year-old remains in high spirits and motivated, via Shahan Ahmed of NBCLA.com:\n\n\u201cI definitely hope to stick around and just get the NBA experience, but if not, get back to the D-League, keep working hard, keep working on my game and see where that goes,\u201d Nwaba said.\n\nThere\u2019s no doubt Nwaba has the right attitude moving forward, and if he maintains that mindset it may not be long before he\u2019s back on the NBA level if the Lakers choose to bring on another player with a 10-day deal.",

Panthers coach Ron Rivera has said throughout this offseason he wants to have Newton run less often, in part to reduce the number of hits he takes.\n\nThe Panthers also announced defensive end Charles Johnson (back) and wide receiver Damiere Byrd (knee) are expected to undergo procedures that will sideline them for a similar amount of time.", 
        "body0": "Jemele Hill and Michael Smith discuss on SC6 if Cam Newton's rotator cuff surgery will be a problem going forward for the Panthers. (1:51)\n\nCHARLOTTE, N.C. -- Before anyone blames Cam Newton's 2016 throwing struggles on a shoulder injury, one that we learned on Tuesday will require surgery, consider this:\n\nThe Carolina Panthers quarterback completed 48 percent of his passes over the final four games, including the Week 14 win against San Diego in which he suffered the partially torn rotator cuff. His percentage in the previous three games was 44.8 percent. The 2015 NFL MVP was well on his way to a career-worst 52.9 completion percentage before the hit, though the offensive line was in shambles and would have made it tough on a lot of quarterbacks.\n\nThat Newton needs surgery for the second offseason in four years explains why coach Ron Rivera was so insistent late last season that the offense evolve with Newton less involved in the running game.\n\nIt's no secret Newton takes a pounding. He's been hit more than any quarterback since entering the NFL as the top pick of the 2011 draft.\n\nIt's not even close.\n\nAccording to ESPN Stats & Information, Newton has been sacked or hit 922 times. Seattle quarterback Russell Wilson is second during that span at 615.\n\nCam Newton has been hit more than any other quarterback since entering the league in 2011. Grant Halverson/Getty Images\n\nNewton handled the hits well as a young pup. He admittedly felt safer running away from defenders outside the pocket or on read-option plays up the middle than he did while throwing inside the pocket.\n\nHe probably still feels that way.\n\nBut with Newton set to turn 28 in May, it's time for the Panthers to protect their franchise player, the one general manager Dave Gettleman still believes can take Carolina to the \"Promised Land.\"\n\nEvolving the offense to give Newton fewer runs out of the read-option is the way to go, although the read-option is a big part of his success in both college and the NFL.\n\nHe needed only 79 games to become the NFL's all-time leader with 32 games in which he threw and ran for a touchdown. It took the previous record holder, Hall of Famer Steve Young, 169 games.\n\nNewton's 48 career rushing touchdowns in six seasons also blew away Young's mark of 45 -- in 15 seasons.\n\nYoung never ran the read-option, although he told me two years ago he wished he had the opportunity. Most of his runs were on rollouts from the West Coast offense or quarterback sneaks.\n\nYoung didn't take the punishment Newton did in the pocket, either. He was sacked an average of 23 times a season. Newton's average is a whopping 36.8.\n\nThe best way to reverse that pace is for Carolina to evolve into a scheme that calls for more play-action, more two- back or two-tight end sets.\n\nInvesting more in better linemen, particularly at tackle, is a good place to start. Signing left tackle Matt Kalil to a five-year, $55.5 million deal, whether you think it's too much or not, showed Gettleman is serious about protecting Newton.\n\nNewton also has to improve his footwork and accuracy. His 61.7 completion percentage in 2013 is the best of his career and only the second time he's finished at 60 or better.\n\nYoung topped 60 percent in 10 seasons, including a career-best 70.3 percent in 1994, on the way to a career average of 64.3.\n\nNewton is at 58.4.\n\nThis isn't to say 60 percent is a magic number. Newton completed only 59.8 percent of his attempts when he had a career-best 35 touchdown passes to go with 10 rushing touchdowns during his MVP season.\n\nBetter protection and a willingness to take what team owner Jerry Richardson called the \"gimme throws\" will help Newton complete more passes and keep the offense moving forward.\n\nIt may also lengthen his career.\n\nNewton may celebrate rushing touchdowns with the \"Superman\" move, but he's not the \"Man of Steel\" when it comes to being hurt. His upcoming shoulder surgery, after he had an ankle surgery during the 2014 offseason and a concussion that sidelined him for a game this past season, is proof of that.\n\nNewton has a 12-16 week rehabilitation program, which will cut it close for training camp. It's similar to the schedule he experienced with the ankle.\n\nPerhaps while rehabbing Newton can get himself mentally prepared for a career as more of a pocket passer. It's not a concept he's had to deal with before, although Rivera said in 2014 the Panthers had to \"adapt and develop a different style.\"\n\nThat lasted until a Week 5 game at Cincinnati when the Panthers needed Newton to run. He carried 17 times for 107 yards and a touchdown after carrying only 14 times for 42 yards in the first four games.\n\nFor Newton's sake, Rivera needs to stick to his 2017 plan of letting his offense and quarterback evolve.\n\nThe latest surgery should be a good reminder of why.",

The team announced Tuesday that the operation will be performed on March 30.\n\nNewton is expected to miss organized team activities (OTAs) earlier in the summer, but is expected to be ready for training camp in late July.\n\nESPN reports the tear occurred in Week 14 of last season in a game against the Los Angeles, then San Diego, Chargers. An MRI revealed afterwards Newton had suffered a partial tear, but the team did not report it. Newton did not miss a game due to the injury.\n\nNewton has missed just three games over his six year career, and this will be his second offseason surgery.\n\nThe team\u2019s head athletic trainer Ryan Vermillion talked about the plan for Newton post-surgery on the team\u2019s website.\n\nNewton can start throwing again 12 weeks after surgery, and then a month later he can join the team according to Vermillion.

That said, an extension to provide a little more stability for both the player and the team always seemed to be the goal.\n\nThe 26-year-old linebacker is coming off a strong bounce-back season after struggling to make an impact with the Philadelphia Eagles in 2015. He racked up 115 combined tackles, four fumble recoveries, two interceptions and a touchdown in his first year with the Dolphins.\n\nStaying healthy was the biggest key. The Oregon product has an extensive injury history, including a torn ACL that forced him to miss the entire 2014 season with the Buffalo Bills.\n\nIn January, Alonso told Barry Jackson of the Miami Herald that he finally started feeling like the player he was before the injuries started to take their collective toll.\n\n\"I feel back to normal,\" he said. \"I feel my explosion, my strength, everything.\"\n\nAlas, Adam Caplan of ESPN reported the defender needed a thumb procedure following the Dolphins' wild-card loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers.\n\nHis long-term position is one other question mark. He spent his first season in Miami operating as an effective middle linebacker, but there's been talk about potentially moving him to the outside in the future.\n\nSalguero passed along further information about the situation:\n\nA source close to Alonso tells the Miami Herald that Alonso doesn't want to move from the middle linebacker spot in 2017. He enjoys playing middle linebacker the most and believes that's his spot, the source said. Alonso, by the way, has on separate occasions also told me he prefers to play middle linebacker but would consider doing whatever was best for the team.\n\nAlonso figures to pencil in as the Dolphins' starter at middle linebacker to open the 2017 campaign.\n\nThe team added former Steelers linebacker Lawrence Timmons to the fold, but Alonso's contract extension makes it seem like he's the answer in the middle.\n\nWhether he stays there for the long haul will depend on his production, but he should remain a tackling machine regardless of his position.",

When we came on the dance floor, you did your own thing. It was going on.\"\n\nChecker \u2014 who performs in Bonita Springs on Tuesday \u2014 said other dances followed: the pony, the fly and the shake. And with \"The Twist,\" Checker forever would be intertwined in rock 'n' roll lore as the performer who liberated a generation, giving teens the freedom to express themselves with their counterparts.\n\nThe phenomenon began in the summer of 1960 in New Jersey, when Checker sang his version of \"The Twist\" at the Rainbow Club. Growing up in the projects of South Philadelphia, Checker loved singing and by age 18 ventured out as an artist.\n\nIt was Checker's performance of \"The Twist\" that caught on, not the version from the song's writer, Hank Ballard, recorded in 1959. Checker made several appearances on \"American Bandstand\" and the song propelled to No. 1 twice, in 1960 and 1962. It's the only song to ever have logged two separate runs to No. 1, and it remains the No. 1 song of the '60s, based on Billboard's Hot 100 hits of that decade, ahead of the Beatles' \"Hey Jude\" in 1968 at No. 2 and \"I Want To Hold Your Hand\" from 1964 at No. 5.\n\nChecker recalled discussing his TV performance with Dick Clark, the \"American Bandstand\" host, afterward. \"American Bandstand\" was a popular show for teens from the 1950s into the '80s, as Clark often introduced new musicians for the first time to a wide U.S. audience.\n\n\u201cHe said, \u2018I made you a big star Chubby.' I said 'I made you a bigger star.' It was a blessing that was given to me and a blessing also was given to them. Me coming on 'Bandstand,' I realized later it was just as exciting for them as it was for me.\"\n\nChecker said he never imagined the song and the dance would become so big.

Steve Knight, R-Calif., to unveil a proposal amending the Small Business Act to give \u201cclear job description to Commercial Marketing Representatives at the Small Business Administration and help small businesses better compete for subcontracts.\u201d\n\nBrat, who made national headlines for beating former U.S. House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Va., in a major upset, chairs the House Economic Growth, Tax, and Capital Access Subcommittee and is the sponsors of the bill.\nI look forward to working in a bipartisan manner with my colleagues on the House Small Business Committee to pass this important clarifying legislative language to ensure small businesses can continue to provide value goods and services to Americans.\u201d\n\n\u201cSmall businesses are the backbone of our economy and it is imperative that we reduce barriers to accessing contracting opportunities,\u201d said Knight.\n\u201cI applaud Representatives Brat and Murphy for introducing this bipartisan measure that would provide clarity for our Commercial Market Representatives as they help our small business compete for subcontracts.\u201d\n\nThe bill was sent to the House Small Business Committee on Friday.\nAs a member of the House Small Business Committee and as ranking member of the Subcommittee on Contracting and Workforce, I\u2019ll continue to fight for small businesses in central Florida and across our country.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe must work to ensure Commercial Marketing Representatives (CMRs) require prime contractors comply with subcontracting requirements,\u201d Brat said.\n\u201cThe federal government spends about $500 billion a year on federal contracts for goods and services, and Congress must ensure our nation\u2019s small businesses have a fair shot at federal contracts and subcontracts,\u201d Murphy said when they brought the bill out.\n", 
        "body1": "Edward Isaac-Dovere: You used to teach.\n\nRep. David Brat: Yep.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nDovere: If you were telling your students about the last couple of days, couple of weeks of this, what would you tell them? How would you tell them about what\u2019s going on?\n\nBrat: Yeah. No. I\u2019m glad\u2014I taught economics, right? And some people think that, by definition, is ideological or whatever, but there\u2019s not really much alternative to free-market economics. I mean, that\u2019s what we teach, is markets, right, supply-and-demand curve. And, so, I would just get into the economics of it, right? And, so, in every market under the sun, for every good, or if you just look at an intro./micro. book, you\u2019ve got, kind of, the four basic models, right? Monopoly is the worst outcomes and perfect competition is kind of utopian thing that\u2019s in fiction land, a little bit\u2014\n\nDovere: Right.\n\nBrat: \u2014doesn\u2019t exist in the real world. But it results, in theory, in the lowest price and best quality, and highest quantity. And monopoly is exact opposite, right? It\u2019s all the worst outcomes in the book, and in the middle, you\u2019ve got monopolistic competition and oligopoly. And, so, I just say let\u2019s look at healthcare. Right? Where does that fit? And what kind of outcomes would social science predict? Which, so, I\u2019m kind of glad you asked the question, because, right, I mean, the last thing you ever hear up here is social science. And, I mean, I could tell you my grad school jokes.\n\nDovere: You can go for it.\n\nBrat: In certain rooms around campus\u2014and you can be creative on which rooms you might think. We had signs that said \u201cThe social sciences are neither.\u201d Right? So that\u2019s the joke, right\u2014the social sciences are neither. But\u2014\n\nDovere: I was a humanities guy, so I don\u2019t know.\n\nBrat: That\u2019s\u2014I went to seminary, so\u2014I\u2019m half humanities. And, then, I did a Ph.D. in economics, right? So, but you do the best you can, and there\u2019s no better, right? So Milton Friedman and all the latest and greatest say you put out the best hypothesis you can. You try to falsify it, and whatever\u2019s left standing is the best theory you have.\n\nAnd, so, economic theory, when you address it to healthcare, and you look at the design, and Milton Freedman would have said, \u201cWhen you aim at a policy target, hit it.\u201d Right? And the problem with healthcare is, we don\u2019t even know what the target is.\n\nAnd, so, right now, when it comes to the House bill, there\u2019s a few targets that we got to hit, and we\u2019re not really aiming at any of them.\n\nDovere: Are you amazed\u2014and we\u2019ve been talking about Obamacare repeal for a long time\u2014\n\nBrat: Yeah.\n\nDovere: \u2014for longer than you\u2019ve been in Congress.\n\nBrat: Yep.\n\nDovere: That we are sitting here, today, and you say we still don\u2019t know what the target is. Is that just amazing to you?\n\nBrat: Yeah, it is amazing.\n\nDovere: Whose fault [ph] is that?\n\nBrat: Well, it\u2019s politics. And that\u2019s the problem, right? Politics is dominating policy. So, you have one group. Five percent of the population has pre-existing conditions, and it counts\u2014that 5% of people account for over half of the costs. So, and that\u2019s not an insurance problem. They can\u2019t get insurance. No one will cover them economically, right? So there\u2019s kind of a market failure, right, and you won\u2019t get me to say that too often, right?\n\nDovere: Mm-hmm.\n\nBrat: But that\u2014there\u2019s a market failure, where we have to step in with a safety net and welfare policy, and so we need\u2014that\u2019s the target, right? So you need to help these people, and help that target.\n\nBut, then, you don\u2019t want that logic to overwhelm your macro-theory on healthcare, and you don\u2019t want that logic to apply to 300 million people, right? So, then, you want to put pure competition in play for hospitals and insurance companies and the healthcare market, et cetera. And, so, we\u2019re not doing that.\n\nMy big talking point the whole week has been the insurance regulations are the key piece. They\u2019re driving the costs up. And, so, Obamacare, when it was initiated, paid almost sole attention to coverage, right? The insurance guys walked in the White House looking at their shoes, kind of embarrassed. And eight years later, we\u2019re in a death spiral. That\u2019s why they were looking at their shoes, by the way, right?\n\nDovere: Mm-hmm.\n\nBrat: They knew the system they had designed didn\u2019t meet Econ 101 logic. So, now, we\u2019re in a death spiral, and I think we\u2019re about ready to make the same mistake. Everyone is focused on coverage. The CBO is all about coverage. You just heard the Democrats. It\u2019s all about coverage. And no one holds them accountable to Econ 101. The prices are going up 25%. Right? And that\u2019s just the on average\u2014and so how do you fix that? Well, you\u2019ve got to get people shopping, and it\u2019s not all, you know, bad intent. After World War II, we did the employer-based healthcare. That was a huge distortion and a mistake. But, now, it\u2019s embedded, so going after that politics is very difficult.\n\nBut that\u2014basically, you gave a tax-preferred treatment to the employer-provided care, pre-tax, right? So the person gets compensation in the form of healthcare, and then you\u2019ve got a $30 copay, and you go into the doctor and pay your 30 bucks, and everything else is free, right? The marginal cost is zero. Well, guess what happens when the marginal benefit is high and the marginal cost is zero? You consume a lot of stuff, and that\u2019s what\u2019s wrong with healthcare, right? So we\u2019ve gone that model, and this is very fixable. But the politics kind of dominates the logic lately.\n\nDovere: We\u2019re two months into the new administration. We have a Republican majority in the House. We have a Republican majority in the Senate. A Republican president who said, over and over again, how committed he was to Obamacare repeal.\n\nBrat: Right.\n\nDovere: How are we still so far, in your mind, from there being a solution to this?\n\nBrat: Right. Well, there\u2019s a lot of competing and conflicting policy objectives, right? The president wants to cover all people, in some way. And we want to bring down costs, and we want to have competition across state lines, right? And it\u2019s very hard to achieve that, right? And, so, that\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to sort out right now.\n\nAnd, but, just going with fundamentals there, I think the key is, is most of us have in mind the promise we made. Repeal and replace. And it started off eight years ago, just repeal. And then it was repeal and replace with free-market outcomes right? And now it\u2019s repeal and replace with the basic structure of Obamacare. I\u2019ve got the National Journal right over here this morning. The front-page article\u2014conservative theorists and liberal theorists from the think tanks both agree that the primary architecture of Obamacare remains in place our bill. Right?\n\nAnd, so, that\u2019s\u2014those of us who are opposed to it, that\u2019s why we\u2019re opposed, right? We don\u2019t want that fundamental, federal architecture.\n\nDovere: Was it\u2014Speaker Ryan said this was the plan that we ran on last year, and then people have been a little confused of what\u2014\n\nBrat: Yeah.\n\nDovere: \u2014he means by the plan, since the plan seems to be changing? Was the mistake not being more ready to go, not having this debate last year or some time before six, seven weeks into the presidency?\n\nBrat: Ah, yeah. I think\u2013we\u2019ve been talking about having regular order. This really wasn\u2019t regular order, right? And just in terms of sixth-grade civics class, how do you know what common sense is? Well, he had a better way of agenda, and Rand Paul\u2019s got a bill. And in eighth-grade civics sense, you\u2019d want a debate, on the floor. Right? The old, kind of model of great spokesmen standing up and debating each other. \u201cMy bill\u2019s better. My\u2014\u201d That never happened. We have never had a debate between competing ideas. It was, kind of, the better-way agenda which laid out, kind of, bullet points. But it did not contain a lot that\u2019s in that bill, right? And that\u2019s what\u2019s causing a lot of the heartache.\n\nDovere: So what\u2019s your level of confidence, at this point? That we\u2019re going to have a bill\u2014\n\nBrat: No.\n\nDovere: You\u2019re shaking your head. There\u2019s not going to be a bill that passes the House and passes the Senate\u2014\n\nBrat: Not this one. Not this one. Right. I don\u2019t even think it\u2019s close, so we\u2014\n\nDovere: Will there be a bill that gets to the president\u2019s desk, that he signs, that does anything that you feel like is significant in terms of Obamacare repeal, from what you\u2019ve seen so far?\n\nBrat: Yeah, I think so. They want to get to yes, and I think they know, the primary impetus has got to be on keeping your word, right? So the repeal side. So the moderates now, in the Senate, especially. I mean, they want everything. Medicaid expansion, increased tax credit. Increase everything. Well, that\u2019s not the promise we made. Right? We never said repeal and increase\u2014\n\nDovere: Right [LAUGHS].\n\nBrat: \u2014everything under the sun, right? So that, I think, when you go back to your base, and I hope we don\u2019t forget our base. But, no, we\u2019ll get there, and it\u2014basically, the answer is, if you put bucket two, right, the insurance regs that Tom Price is going to work on as secretary, in the bill. And then you run into this Byrd Rule nonsense, which we can overcome, I think, fairly easily.\n\nAnd I\u2019m not saying that. We talked with the national experts on that Byrd Rule stuff. And it\u2019s\u2014Pence gets into the Chair, and the Parliamentarian counsels you, and then the Chair says, \u201cThank you very much for the counsel. Let\u2019s vote.\u201d Right? And the Senate is, based on what I just told\u2014what they want, they\u2019re using that as a block.\n\nDovere: But Pence in the Chair only matters if you\u2019re at 50/50, and there are more than\u2014you\u2019ve got a three-seat Republican majority in the Senate.\n\nBrat: Yeah.\n\nDovere: There are more than three Republican Senators who are on the fence here about this, right?\n\nBrat: Well, and it\u2014some of it has to do, though, with the\u2014with the, he serves as the Chair of the Senate, and so back\u2014Mike Lee [ph] talked on this last night, a little bit. But the reason we\u2019re at where we\u2019re at on the 2015 repeal bill, that\u2019s the part we\u2019re insisting on, right? That we want to see as the base line. And that was a compromise package that came out two years ago and dealt with the Byrd Rule. But the reason they had to reach that compromise was because Biden was in the chair. And it didn\u2019t have to do with a 50/50 vote\u2014\n\nDovere: Got it. Okay. Right.\n\nBrat: \u2014it has to do with he\u2019s the chair, right? And, so, there\u2019s a\u2014there\u2019s some complexity with that. But it\u2019s\u2014\n\nDovere: All the Parliamentary rules, right?\n\nBrat: Right. Right. And just so people out there know, the criterion for overcoming the Byrd Rule is just that it has to have budgetary impact. And, so, I mean, everybody in their right mind knows the insurance regs have a huge impact on the budget, for real, right? And Paul Ryan\u2019s even arguing that we\u2019re having, after three years, we finally get the price to come down 10%. And guess what drives that 10% price reduction? We got rid of the platinum/gold/silver thing. That\u2019s a regulation\n\nDovere: I mean, I remember the week after the election, talking to some of the Obama folks\u2014\n\nBrat: Yeah.\n\nDovere: \u2014who said, you know what, if they want to change, make a couple of tweaks to it, and keep Obamacare, that\u2019s fine.\n\nBrat: Right.\n\nDovere: They can call it whatever they want. Obama himself said stuff like that.\n\nBrat: Right.\n\nDovere: I went out to Chicago for that farewell speech that Obama did.\n\nBrat: Yeah.\n\nDovere: Afterwards, one of the people who\u2019d worked on Obamacare said to me, \u201cI will bet you money they don\u2019t repeal Obamacare.\u201d And now, in these last couple of weeks\u2014\n\nBrat: Right.\n\nDovere: \u2014the Democrats, they are giddy, basically.\n\nBrat: Right.\n\nDovere: They think you guys\u2014\n\nBrat: I know.\n\nDovere: \u2014are killing each other.\n\nBrat: Right.\n\nDovere: So is there going to\u2014you really think there\u2019s a bill that will make you happy that the president will sign?\n\nBrat: It\u2019s not going to ever make me totally happy\u2014\n\nDovere: Right.\n\nBrat: \u2014but I get the nature of this thing, right? And, so, the key, for me, when you started off with the economics, I got it. That\u2019s got to be what\u2019s there. You\u2019ve got to have\u2014you can have the central government come in on the welfare side, on the safety-net side, on the preexisting conditions issue, block grants the states [ph], and funding is not\u2014we\u2019re not squabbling about that, which is unique, right?\n\nDovere: Right.\n\nBrat: We\u2019re willing to give up quite a bit there if you give me that free-market logic going forward on healthcare for 300 million people.\n\nDovere: Right.\n\nBrat: The whole country\u2014there\u2019s no way I can write with\u2014I\u2019d be sued for malpractice\u2014having taught economics\u2014\n\nDovere: [LAUGHS].\n\nBrat: \u2014I mean, it would be malpractice for me to sign off on a bill that doesn\u2019t have that market logic, and everybody back home knows what I ran on.\n\nDovere: Yeah.\n\nBrat: I mean, I ran on Adam Smith and James Madison.\n\nDovere: Yeah.\n\nBrat: That\u2019s what I ran on. And, so, they\u2019re going to say, \u201cAnd you\u2019re voting for\u201d\u2014right? They know. They know who I am. So I\u2019m not\u2014I\u2019m not close until we get that logic in place.\n\nDovere: And so, I mean, what happens if there\u2019s not a repeal, right? You said don\u2019t forget the base. What\u2014\n\nBrat: Right.\n\nDovere: \u2014what\u2019s the, what is the consequence of that, if\u2014if we get to a bill that either doesn\u2019t have enough support in the Senate so that\u2014\n\nBrat: Right.\n\nDovere: \u2014it doesn\u2019t have\u2014the role sort of, consequentially doesn\u2019t have enough support in the House\u2014\n\nBrat: Yep.\n\nDovere: \u2014and so it doesn\u2019t move at all. Or passes the House and doesn\u2019t get through the Senate.\n\nBrat: Yep. Well, then the messaging just overwhelmingly is, what\u2019s going to happen is, Obamacare is in a death spiral. It\u2019s collapsing. And that collapse is going to continue. And Trump\u2019s kind of said it, right? The cynical play is just to ride it out and show the internal logic of what they put in place. The car\u2019s in the ditch.\n\nDovere: Yeah.\n\nBrat: We didn\u2019t put the car in the ditch. Right? So the car\u2014and they\u2019ll have to message like crazy. Our side is not good at messaging. Right? Trump is the first guy we got that\u2019s out there. He\u2019s\u2014[OVERLAPPING].\n\nDovere: [LAUGHS]. The Democrats always talk about how your side does much better at messaging.\n\nBrat: [LAUGHS] Oh, really? That\u2019s\u2014I\u2014\n\nDovere: \u2014is a surprise to you?\n\nBrat: Based on the last Town Hall I had, it\u2019s a surprise to me, right? I had red cards a-blazing and boo\u2019ing after 20 seconds.\n\nDovere: Was that a surprise, like, it having that kind of\u2014\n\nBrat: Oh, yeah. That was all brand-new.\n\nDovere: Yeah.\n\nBrat: No one knew that was coming.\n\nDovere: And do you feel like that\u2019s reflecting something that has changed about the politics in this country, or\u2014\n\nBrat: All the Democrats told me. I mean, they\u2014we all get along personally, right? They\u2019re just\u2014but they\u2014the Democrat activists in my district, they said, \u201cWe were asleep, and we\u2019re ticked at ourself.\u201d I mean, that, they said came out and said, \u201cWe were sleeping. Trump won. We thought Hillary had it. And now we\u2019re ticked, right?\n\nDovere: Right [LAUGHS].\n\nBrat: So now they\u2019re ticked at themselves. And, so, now they\u2019re just\u2014\n\nDovere: They\u2019re just going to take it out on you is what you feel like [ph].\n\nBrat: They\u2019re just\u2014they\u2019re just\u2014oh\u2014they\u2019re ticked\u2014right. I\u2019m the\u2014right. I\u2019m the available guy.\n\nDovere: So there are about 30,000 people in your district who use the tax credits for insurance.\n\nBrat: Right.\n\nDovere: What do you say to them about that, the possibility of those going away?\n\nBrat: The tax\u2014under what scenario?\n\nDovere: Well, I mean, in any of the scenarios here. If that could be the way that this bill ends up moving forward, what do you say to those people?\n\nBrat: Well, I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m talking about, quite yet. I mean, get rid\u2014you mean, say, like, we get rid of the tax credit\u2014the refundable tax credit? We\u2019re not necessarily opposed to that provi\u2014it\u2019s how. We just had an amendment, in budget right now, that said we got to make sure that those tax credits don\u2019t go to the higher-income folks, and they go only to the population in need.\n\nDovere: Mm-hmm.\n\nBrat: And, so, that\u2019s what we\u2019re talking about, right? The safety-net part isn\u2019t the part that\u2019s in dispute. It\u2019s the refundable tax credits, and, then, to able-bodied, right? The Democrats totally disagree. They just voted on another amendment, right there. They said the idea of work requirements is repugnant and a put-down to human beings.\n\nI totally disagree. I mean, I know everybody in the disability community, across the\u2014they all want their kids mainstreamed in school and mainstreamed in the workforce. And, so, I don\u2019t know what the Democrats are talking about. I haven\u2019t met a person out there who doesn\u2019t want a job, and the idea of means testing, right, for able-bodied adults? I mean, if they want to have that debate, I\u2019ll have it all day.\n\nDovere: I mean, I think one of the perspectives is that, it seems to me, you might have on this is your mother was a social worker, right? You know\u2014\n\nBrat: Yeah.\n\nDovere: \u2014it was, you\u2014this was, some of these issues, I\u2019m sure, were on your mind, growing up\u2014\n\nBrat: Yeah.\n\nDovere: \u2014and you\u2019d seen from what she was doing.\n\nBrat: Sure.\n\nDovere: And\u2014is that\u2014how does that inform your perspective on how you go about doing this stuff?\n\nBrat: Well, I\u2019m an economist, and so I\u2019m an efficiency guy, right? And, so, the first thing you do, when you want to help the poor, is you got to get them into the workforce. I mean, I\u2019m a Calvinist, if that gives you any hint, right? So we\u2019ve got the whole work-ethic thing. That\u2019s my background.\n\nAnd you don\u2019t have to be a Calvinist. The Chinese and the Indians\u2014when I started teaching econ 20 years ago, made $1,000 each, per person. Now they\u2019re at $10,000, because they went free market. So, right? So they just lifted two and a half billion people out of poverty by using free markets.\n\nAnd we\u2019re moving away from free markets. And I\u2014the burden is against me? Really? [LAUGHS]. I mean, all the evidence I know of, right, economic growth gets you everything you want, right? It gets you political rights, civil rights, women\u2019s rights, civil liberties, higher educational attainment, higher human capital, clean air, clean water. Economic growth gets you everything.\n\nAnd, so, I don\u2019t know how the other side debates and how we lose. That\u2019s what I\u2019m talking about in the messaging war.\n\nDovere: Mm-hmm.\n\nBrat: Right? In K to 12, the teachers are kind of neutral on education and capitalism and business. In higher ed, they\u2019re antagonistic. Right? So we\u2019re telling young people, what you do all day long, right, for nine hours or ten hours a day, is morally reprehensible. I mean, what a positive, uplifting message. [LAUGHS].\n\nDovere: [LAUGHS] Let me bring something to you that you said back at the end of January, right. You got a lot of attention for this. You said, \u201cThe women are in my grill\u2014\n\nBrat: Yeah.\n\nDovere: \u2014\u201cno matter where I go.\u201d\n\nBrat: Yeah.\n\nDovere: How has that shaped things? So did the women who are in your grill, did they win? Did they succeed in blocking this up and making this a much harder thing?\n\nBrat: No. And that whole thing, the press, I mean, jacked data [ph], right? We\u2019re dealing with trillion-dollar issues, and that is the news, right?\n\nDovere: [LAUGHS].\n\nBrat: So in the first\u2014a constituency\u2014\n\nDovere: Well, you saying, \u201cin my grill,\u201d I think, you got people\u2014[OVERLAPPING]\n\nBrat: And I didn\u2019t even know what a grill was. The constituents told me that. They said, \u201cWe\u2019re going to get in your grill.\u201d And I made the mistake of repeating that phrase. Whoops. Because I thought it was funny. And you\u2019ll hear\u2014right after\u2014everyone\u2019s laughing afterward. I never say a negative word about anybody, right? I went to seminary.\n\nIt\u2019s a\u2014for me, it\u2019s a joke. But, then, it went to the BuzzFeed, which, you can get a sense from the \u201cBuzz\u201dFeed, right? I mean, it\u2019s the buzz saw, probably. And HuffPost. And, then, they view it. And then The Washington Post repeats it, because they\u2019re left-wing fake news lately. And, then, all the local papers think, well, The Washington Post\u2014[OVERLAPPING].\n\nDovere: Well, let me stop you on the fake news thing.\n\nBrat: \u2014printed it, and so you get [OVERLAPPING]\u2014it blows up. Yeah.\n\nDovere: Because that\u2019s going around a lot. What is fake news, to you?\n\nBrat: Yeah. Fake news, to me, is when the Richmond Times-Dispatch\u2014and since, they\u2019ve been very good. But they had a first couple stories in The Washington Post. I had 500 meetings with constituents over the past two years. Never an interview with any of these papers on my positive contributions that I think I\u2019ve made, right? Maybe they disagree with me, politically. But 500 meetings with constituents. And then, the headline after Trump wins, two weeks in, where\u2019s Dave Brat? He can\u2019t be found. No one can find him. And that\u2019s\u2014\n\nDovere: And where is Dave Brat? [LAUGHS]\n\nBrat: I know. Going around the district, right? Up here, working and voting. I mean, that\u2019s fake news, right? And, so, when I\u2019ve been the guy on the fiscal stuff, the budget deficit, the $100 in unfunded liabilities. Every\u2014I go out to the press corps after every vote. Most people run away from the press. They\u2019re scared. I go right into the press every day. And, so, fake news is when the narrative changes from \u201cDave\u2019s everywhere,\u201d which is what my district knows to be true to\u2014the narrative changes to \u201cWhere\u2019s Dave?\u201d I mean, and then, you\u2019re like, okay. And I don\u2019t have a big megaphone, right? You don\u2019t have a lot of money?\n\nDovere: Because, and I\u2019m speaking as a journalist, here, of course. So this is a sensitive topic. [LAUGHTER].\n\nBrat: Right, no. Don\u2019t do fake news.\n\nDovere: Right. So, the original fake news, like, what that was, was, politically deployed\u2014\n\nBrat: Right.\n\nDovere: \u2014actually made-up news.\n\nBrat: Right.\n\nDovere: And your problem is with news you feel like is not taking into account the full picture of what\u2019s going on\u2014\n\nBrat: Yeah, right.\n\nDovere: \u2014or that\u2019s pointed in a direction.\n\nBrat: Right.\n\nDovere: Right.\n\nBrat: Right. And another example is, the job news\u2014right, now, the opinion page is different.\n\nDovere: Right.\n\nBrat: Right? If people want to take\u2014hit me\u2013I never\u2014you can\u2019t complain about that. That\u2019s people\u2019s opinion. But on the news, if there\u2019s a piece on, like, healthcare, et cetera. People taking it to me on healthcare. That\u2019s fine, but they always give me the worst-case scenario. What are you going to do about this particular individual, in a terrible position, after the car\u2019s already in the ditch? What we\u2019ve been talking about.\n\nDovere: Mm-hmm.\n\nBrat: Right? And there\u2019s no context given about Obamacare in a death spiral, in the article. Right? So there\u2019s no eight-year historical context. And it\u2019s\u2014I\u2019m supposed to solve the problem immediately, for 300 million people.\n\nAnd, so, there\u2019s always this, kind of, bias of \u201cWell, what are you going to do about it?\u201d And I\u2019m, like, \u201cHoly mo\u2014that\u2019s a big project.\u201d Right? And, so, that\u2014the news could really help by providing the context as to how we got here. And then, like, they weren\u2019t also reporting on the main alternative bills out there. The Cruz bill, what is it? The Price bill, what is it? What\u2019s Trump want? And that\u2019s what I\u2019m getting at. If the news would do that. And, then, they say, \u201cHey, we don\u2019t find your answers sufficient,\u201d that\u2019s fine. I mean, that\u2019s\u2014\n\nDovere: It\u2019s fair to say you\u2019re not a fan of Obamacare, as a\u2014\n\nBrat: Right.\n\nDovere: \u2014right. So let me ask you. Do you, and I\u2019m going to ask you a, sort of, a worst-case scenario thing.\n\nBrat: Yeah.\n\nDovere: If you have the option of repealing Obamacare\u2014\n\nBrat: Yep.\n\nDovere: \u2014or leaving it in place and, as you think it\u2019s going to go, into a death spiral\u2014\n\nBrat: Yeah.\n\nDovere: \u2014which is the better option, there? If you guys can\u2019t agree on some kind of a replace plan?\n\nBrat: Well, that\u2019s a hypothetical. I mean, and you said\u2014if what you\u2014I\u2019ll answer your question. I\u2019d vote for the repeal.\n\nDovere: [LAUGHS].\n\nBrat: Right?\n\nDovere: So it\u2019s better to be in the system that we had in 2009, right, than to let\u2014\n\nBrat: Oh, that way, right. Just to repeal, you mean?\n\nDovere: Yeah.\n\nBrat: Without a replace.\n\nDovere: I mean, you are more confident than some\u2014\n\nBrat: Yeah.\n\nDovere: \u2014that there is a replace bill\u2014\n\nBrat: Right.\n\nDovere: \u2014that could get through, that would be significant. So\u2014\n\nBrat: Yeah.\n\nDovere: So it is a hypothetical\u2014\n\nBrat: Right.\n\nDovere: \u2014but it\u2019s a\u2014\n\nBrat: Yeah. No, no.\n\nDovere: \u2014hypothetical, sort of, informed by where we are in these last couple of weeks.\n\nBrat: Right. Right. And, so, no. I\u2014so, I stick with it. I\u2019d go with the repeal. And my emphasis\u2014it\u2019s always better to start off with free-market foundation and then add on the safety nights, right? Rationally and\u2014\n\nDovere: Right.\n\nBrat: \u2014intentionally, rather than start off with a socialist framework, which has already shown itself to fail in every country through history, by the way, and the decline of nations. Every nation, there\u2019s one\u2014it\u2019s corruption and cronyism and et cetera at the federal level, right? That\u2019s why nations fall apart, is due to federal-government corruption. And, so, that\u2014all of our founders got that right? Right, the checks and balances. But now, DC, all the cranes are building in DC. And everybody knows what\u2019s going on in the new Rome, here, right?\n\nDovere: Right [LAUGHS]. There\u2019s a lot of building going on.\n\nBrat: Yeah, a lot of building here. Right.\n\nDovere: There are\u2014one of the things that strikes me about what\u2019s going on is that there are a lot of people who call themselves Republicans these days. There are a lot of people who call themselves conservatives these days.\n\nBrat: Yeah.\n\nDovere: Not everybody seems to agree on what that means.\n\nBrat: Right. That\u2019s good. Right. Right.\n\nDovere: So to you\u2014\n\nBrat: Yep.\n\nDovere: What is\u2014in 2017\u2014what does that mean, to be a conservative, to be a Republican, or, maybe, to be a conservative Republican?\n\nBrat: Yeah, well, I mean, I\u2019ve got a book on it, if your listeners have a hard time falling asleep. It\u2019s all right there, American Underdog [ph], I mean, right. So this isn\u2019t my thinking.\n\nDovere: Right.\n\nBrat: The conservatives really don\u2019t have an intellectual system, right? The Burkean notion is, it\u2019s kind of an organic thing that\u2019s built up over a long term of history. But the Judeo-Christian tradition, which gets you out of that\u2014you get uniquely the rule of law\u2014and the liberal system, right? I mean, that\u2019s, kind of, the, right\u2014conservatives are now the owners of classical liberalism\u2014Jefferson, and Adam Smith, and all that\u2014and then, after you get the rule of law, you get my guy, Madison, up on the wall there, and Jefferson, and the Virginians. And you get the separation of powers and the Constitution, and 18 enumerative powers for the federal government. And, then, if you\u2019re really lucky, you get Adam Smith and free markets.\n\nRight? At the end of the\u2014and that is all one intellectual tradition. Right? It\u2019s basically a synthesis of the Judeo-Christian tradition and Greek reason. Right? In my Town Hall, I said that, and somebody said, \u201cSo you worship Zeus?\u201d just as a\u2014what I got to deal with, right? Just to have a little humor along the way. Right? I said, whatever. Okay. Moving on. But\u2014\n\nDovere: [LAUGHS]. And do you worship Zeus? Let\u2019s just clear that up.\n\nBrat: No, I\u2019m kind of a monotheist lately, right? [LAUGHTER]. I love the Greeks, though. I like all of them [ph]. Whatever. But that\u2019s it. That\u2019s conservatism. It\u2019s that trajectory, right? Twenty-four hundred years that resulted in Madison and Jefferson. They said, \u201cWhat are you most proud of? What do you want on your tombstone?\u201d Not president, not head of UVA. They\u2019re most proud of their statutes on religious toleration. Unbelievable, right? I mean, that\u2019s what they\u2019re most proud of. They structured it.\n\nAnd, as a conservative, it\u2019s kind of scary. In the school, the kids aren\u2019t learning the basic grounding anymore, right? I tell kids, everyone says, \u201cWell, there\u2019s a separation of church and state, and Dave Brat\u2019s a Presbyterian, and he wants everyone to follow his religion.\u201d No. The First Amendment says \u201cno establishment of religion.\u201d But, comma, \u201cfree expression thereof.\u201d Right? And, so, it\u2019s both parts. It\u2019s worked very well. And, along with that, our rights, in this tradition, come from God and precede government. And, so, the liberals at the Town Hall, I said that, and they were like, \u201cWell, get rid of rights,\u201d they shouted out. And I\u2019m, like, really? That\u2019s where we are?\n\nI mean, then the liberals aren\u2019t liberals anymore. Right? If that\u2019s the view, it\u2019s anarchy, because I\u2019m basically a classical liberal, and liberal comes out of the root word \u201cliberty\u201d\u2014\n\nDovere: Right.\n\nBrat: \u2014which, I\u2019m a big believer in.\n\nDovere: Do you think that Paul Ryan fits your definition of conservative Republican, at this point?\n\nBrat: Intellectually. That\u2019s why I need a lot of aspirin at the end of the night.\n\nDovere: [LAUGHS].\n\nBrat: He\u2019s trained in exactly like I am. He\u2019s Hayekian [ph], Milton Friedman. He likes them. He\u2019s free trade, right? And Hayek\u2019s got a nice little idea called the fatal conceit. And the fatal conceit is to think that our little finite minds can do the mathematical calculations necessary to run an economy for 300 million people. That\u2019s the fatal conceit.\n\nAnd when it comes to healthcare, right, you\u2019ve got Texas and California, huge differences in product diversity, what they want, how much freedom they want, what they want their states to do. And we\u2019ve got a one-size solution that\u2019s going to fix that.\n\nDovere: Right.\n\nBrat: No. I don\u2019t think so. So yeah. That\u2019s why I get a headache. Because I don\u2019t\u2014Paul Ryan was trained in that, and then this is what the bill looks like.\n\nDovere: Right.\n\nBrat: And I know what he wants.\n\nDovere: But maybe not just on Obamacare, right? Do you think that\u2014is he\u2014he\u2019s been Speaker for a while now.\n\nBrat: Yeah.\n\nDovere: Has he been\u2014governing, leading the House as a conservative Republican, by your definition of it?\n\nBrat: Well, I mean, he\u2019s got multiple hats on, right? He\u2019s head of the conference and the politics, and, so, you\u2019ve got a bunch of moderates and tough seats, and he wants to hold that together. And then he\u2019s got this policy theory, where he probably agrees with me. And then those, you know, run into each other and collide when the policy conflicts with the politics. And, right now, the politics is winning too much. And, so, I don\u2019t know if he\u2019s all in charge of that or the Senate\u2019s in charge of that. They\u2019re ducking a lot of this, too. But that\u2019s\u2014the Tea Party movement was, kind of, you know, I\u2019m\u2014we\u2019re sick of this. Whatever is doing this, we\u2019re sick of it.\n\nAnd we just want to get common sense back and have these conservative outcomes, instead of a continuously expanding federal state.\n\nDovere: You probably know where I\u2019m going. What about President Trump? Is he a conservative Republican by your definition of it?\n\nBrat: He is just a unique character. I mean, he\u2019s hard to define. He\u2019s\u2014I mean, he\u2019s, kind of, doing, you know, the economic nationalism piece a little bit. He is\u2014list of issues is conservative. He came out of the gate with a big agenda package, which was repeal and replacement of Obamacare, and I think he had the normal common sense of repeal. When he was campaigning, it wasn\u2019t repeal and replace with expanded tax credit. I never heard that. You know, I never heard the big\u2014right? So when he\u2019s screaming it out and everyone\u2019s yelling down in Florida and\u2014\n\nDovere: Right.\n\nBrat: \u2014wherever, I don\u2019t think they had in mind a bigger federal government.\n\nAnd, then regulatory reform. On that, you see the markets responding. So that\u2019s conservative. Getting rid of regs. And there\u2019s a whole host. But business already has a sense that the federal government is not coming after them anymore, and just lifting that fear, I think the markets feel relieved. And, then, third is tax reform. And he\u2019s going to lower the corporate rate\u2014one of the highest for 35, 39 all in, down to 20. And Larry Lindsey, the Harvard economist that did the Reagan cuts, is estimating 4% GDP growth and 8% wage growth, when we haven\u2019t had wage growth in 30 years.\n\nSo that\u2019s, I think, his number-one piece, right? And so, I mean, that\u2019s JFK, Reagan, whatever. That\u2019s not partisan. JFK got tax cuts and got 5% real growth. So I\u2019m not be\u2014I don\u2019t think that\u2019s partisan. That\u2019s what\u2019s wrong with this city.\n\nDovere: But the question I asked you is whether you think he\u2019s a conservative.\n\nBrat: I think his agenda\u2019s conservative.\n\nDovere: Yeah.\n\nBrat: I mean, he\u2019s a New Yorker. Big, high\u2014I mean, he\u2019s\u2014I mean, it\u2014\n\nDovere: [LAUGHS]. There\u2019s nothing wrong with being a New Yorker.\n\nBrat: He\u2019s a Presbyterian on top of it, right? So, I mean, we\u2019ll see. We\u2019ll see how it all goes.\n\nDovere: I\u2019m going to bet that you have an easier time getting in touch with the Trump White House than you did with the Obama White House.\n\nBrat: Yeah. Oh, yeah.\n\nDovere: What are your dealings, like, with them?\n\nBrat: Not much yet, because they\u2019ve been ramping up. I mean, they\u2019ve been putting everybody in, so they\u2019re all busy, busy. I went over and saw Cohn, the economic advisor on the\u2014our HSA healthcare stuff. And, then, we\u2019re listening to them, but I haven\u2019t been over, yet. And, that\u2019s part of\u2014once things settle down, I think you\u2019ll see a much more aggressive, you know, stance on policy, with us working together. But they just got the Secretary at the first meeting last week\u2013\n\nDovere: Right.\n\nBrat: And, so, they\u2014that\u2019s what they\u2019ve been doing. And, so, I wish we had more meetings on healthcare, earlier.\n\nDovere: Have you dealt with the president, at all?\n\nBrat: A little bit. He called last week. And I talked to him on the phone. He came and helped me in Virginia, right at the beginning. He liked my race against the\u2014when I had my big win.\n\nDovere: [LAUGHS]. Your big win.\n\nBrat: Right [LAUGHS].\n\nDovere: Your big win, which to remind people who may not remember, you took down the majority leader of the House, and I think you\u2019re odds [ph] went 40 to 1?\n\nBrat: Yeah.\n\nDovere: You were so far down in the polls that most people were not even covering the race\u2014\n\nBrat: Yeah.\n\nDovere: \u2014on the night of the primary. I will tell you. I\u2019m going to admit a little bit about my\u2014we had a story ready to go that was about what Eric Cantor [ph], whom you beat, was going to do on immigration reform\u2014\n\nBrat: Right.\n\nDovere: \u2014once he got through the primary with you.\n\nBrat: Right.\n\nDovere: That story never ran [LAUGHS].\n\nBrat: Right. Right. Right.\n\nDovere: So, everyone was taken by surprise\u2014\n\nBrat: Yeah, oh, yeah.\n\nDovere: And, in this way, there are some parallels between what you were able to pull off and what Trump was able to pull of, you on an obviously smaller scale. It\u2019s a House race. But\u2014\n\nBrat: Yep.\n\nDovere: \u2014by tapping into something that was there, that people weren\u2019t appreciating\u2014\n\nBrat: Yeah.\n\nDovere: \u2014by not doing it the way that most people thought\u2014\n\nBrat: Yep.\n\nDovere: \u2014and do you think of yourself that way, as the, like, not the person who showed Donald Trump how to run for president, but as a parallel to what happened there?\n\nBrat: Yeah. Yeah. And it\u2019s not ego driven. I think Trump and I both listen to the people. And, so, I taught economics for 20 years. Immigration wasn\u2019t one of my issues, I mean, going back 20 years to teach at that, you know, it\u2019s not in the book. But, then, you start going around and meeting with people and running\u2014you\u2019re starting to think about running for office. And you go around and talk to people, and then you start hearing about the issue, and you go, \u201cWhat do you think about this? What do you think about this?\u201d And what is the true economic impact? And what did Milton Friedman say about this?\n\nDovere: What\u2019s the moment that that ticks over to you, to say, \u201cOkay. I\u2019m going to run for Congress?\u201d\n\nBrat: Well, that\u2019s a bigger story. I mean, that\u2019s been my whole lifelong\u2014I did economics and ethics. My whole life was putting those two together. Because I went to seminary and then got a Ph.D. in economics and worked at the World Bank and the Army and all that. And, so, that\u2014and I taught it, and I was always thinking about \u201cHow do I do this?\u201d Right? I mean, I don\u2019t want to just sit here and teach my whole life. I want to do some of this and put it in place. And, so, that was that. And, then, I started running for other positions\u2014\n\nDovere: You ran for State House, right.\n\nBrat: \u2014and the cronies I just saw in every state would block you and bat you down. And I was getting sick of that. And, so, I was, like, okay, there\u2019s one way to end that, and it\u2019s just go for the big\u2014big\u2014big prize.\n\nDovere: [LAUGHS]. The first race you ran was for what?\n\nBrat: I ran\u2014I was going to run for State Senate, and I just kind of got the\u2014\n\nDovere: That was when they\u2014they locked you out of the, right, and the\u2014\n\nBrat: \u2014that was a delegate race. It was a delegate race, right. That one was blocked. So I was, like, what\u2019s wrong here, you know? I\u2014everyone liked me, right? I knew all the heads of business, the lobbyists, and everything. And it\u2019s all good. And, then, after I won, it\u2019s like, hey, I, you know, I believe in Madison and Jefferson and Adam Smith. I\u2019m going to do free market, and that\u2019s what I taught. And they\u2019re like, \u201cDave, it\u2019s all nice you believe all that. It\u2019s all great. But you\u2019re not really going to do that, are you?\u201d And I\u2019m, like, \u201cYeah, that\u2019s the plan.\u201d\n\nAnd, so, that\u2019s part\u2014if you get in the way of the cronies, that\u2019s the new thing. And that\u2019s the Trump thing, too, right? This \u201ccleaning the swamp\u201d thing?\n\nDovere: Yeah.\n\nBrat: And the American people were just getting sick of it. So part of\u2014it\u2019s just luck. I mean, I ran at a time when that impulse was just huge, right? People are just sick of the elites getting special deals across the board. And that\u2014I ran right when that was happening.\n\nDovere: And you surprised everybody, right?\n\nBrat: Yep.\n\nDovere: But you did it\u2014why did it work for a Congressional race and not for another race? The State Senate race was an internal party process, and that\u2019s\u2014\n\nBrat: Yeah.\n\nDovere: \u2013part of the difference. But why start with Congress and not\u2014\n\nBrat: Well, that\u2019s, no, I think you\u2019re onto something there. And part of it is the money. And the more local you are, you either have to be very well-known and have, you know, some money and something ready to go. But on this one, what changes, all of a sudden, I got some national media attention, and my own papers. No one would cover anything. And I was telling them. I said, \u201cI\u2019m ahead.\u201d I was telling the papers and my region locals were forever. I said, \u201cI\u2019m 20 points up.\u201d We\u2014in every county. I said, \u201cI\u2019m door to door.\u201d And they thought I was lying. I said, you know, \u201cI went to seminary. I don\u2019t lie.\u201d And they were like, \u201cWell, that\u2019s cute, too.\u201d Right? I mean, it\u2019s all funny. And, so, I was, like, \u201cNo, I\u2019m not lying. I\u2019m telling you the truth. I don\u2019t lie a whole lot.\u201d And they\u2019re, like, okay.\n\nAnd that\u2019s what\u2019s wrong with our society. I mean, it\u2019s just\u2013everyone assumes that we lie, and we\u2019re electing, I guess, too many people that aren\u2019t believable.\n\nDovere: Right.\n\nBrat: And that\u2019s a problem.\n\nDovere: There are a lot of politicians who do lie.\n\nBrat: Yep. I [LAUGHTER]\u2014I mean, that\u2014right? And, so, and the press should light it up on that.\n\nDovere: Well, I mean, some people, right, the joke about political journalism is that it\u2019s the\u2014our job is to stand, waiting, outside of meetings and stick a microphone in front of people\u2019s faces for them to lie to us, right? [LAUGHTER].\n\nBrat: Right.\n\nDovere: But with\u2014you handed me as we were\u2014right before we started\u2014some of the\u2014a list of some of the money that\u2019s being spent against you and other people\u2013\n\nBrat: Right.\n\nDovere: \u2014on the Obamacare thing. I imagine the experience you had in your race\u2014\n\nBrat: Right.\n\nDovere: \u2014of being outspent by that\u2014\n\nBrat: Yeah.\n\nDovere: \u2014makes it so that you don\u2019t pay a lot of attention to the ads that are being run against you.\n\nBrat: No. I know. I\u2014there\u2019s a group that\u2019s anti-Trumpers that are running ads for Trump, this AA\u2014American Action Network. And it\u2019s got special-interest money tied to healthcare\u2014I think Karl Rove, and there\u2019s some elites, right? The elites are the only one for the bill, by the way.\n\nDovere: Mm-hmm.\n\nBrat: Right? The people aren\u2019t. I mean, it\u2019s amazing, right. The elites and the cronies are for the\u2014so, they\u2019re running ads, and it\u2019s basically a pro-Trump, pro-my kind of ideas, and it says, \u201cSupport President Trump,\u201d which most everybody thinks I do, anyway. And it\u2019s got my name and a picture there. And, in my House race that I won, I\u2014there\u2019s $5 million ads run against me.\n\nDovere: That\u2019s a lot.\n\nBrat: But it said \u201cDave Brat, for $5 million worth.\u201d And, so, I was, like, \u201cThank you very much.\u201d Right?\n\nDovere: [LAUGHS]. Free advertising.\n\nBrat: On aisle three at Walmart, everybody knew me. I was, like, \u201cOkay.\u201d\n\nDovere: Let me ask you one more thing about your race and, sort of, how it informs where you\u2019re thinking on things. There\u2013people don\u2019t know exactly what to expect out of 2018, whether we\u2019re going to have a lot of primaries\u2014\n\nBrat: Right.\n\nDovere: \u2014or the Republican Party fighting with itself, or the Democratic Party fighting with itself\u2014\n\nBrat: Yeah.\n\nDovere: \u2014or what it\u2019s going to be.\n\nBrat: Yep.\n\nDovere: What do you think\u2014where\u2019s the Republican Party going to be, going into the mid-term year? Do you think that there should be the kinds of primaries that you ran? Are you the, sort of, touchstone for people to say, \u201cYou actually can win a total underdog race and you can be, I think it\u2019s fair to say, if Eric Cantor were still in the seat that you represent, things might seem a little different right now. But you can make a difference in the way that the\u2014even the whole course of legislation is?\n\nBrat: Yeah, well, it\u2019s hard to say\u2014on the narrow aspect, when I came up here, all the guys were funny. I\u2014the amazing thing\u2014I get along with everybody personally. The Democrats, right? We all work out in the weight room or whatever, and we all get along. And they all said, \u201cThanks Dave.\u201d And what they\u2019re saying is, \u201cI\u2019m looking over my shoulder.\u201d\n\nDovere: Right. Being sarcastic.\n\nBrat: And, so, mine was a shock. Right. And, so, but, it\u2019s a good thing, because now, everybody is looking back at their constituents and saying, \u201cHey. I\u2019m going to listen.\u201d So that\u2019s a net plus. So, you know, you\u2019re always going to have primaries and challenges, but this\u2014this will be the touchstone, this Obamacare repeal, when you promise your base for six or seven years, and it depends what your district looks like.\n\nDovere: Sure.\n\nBrat: Right? Northern Virginia versus where I am or whatever are different. But that\u2019s a huge, right, piece. Is how you communicate with your constituents on those kind of issues. And, so, Trump said, the day after I won, I think he said something like, \u201cNo one\u2019s safe.\u201d Right? This shows you no one\u2019s safe, right? It\u2019s all up for grabs.\n\nDovere: So there should be primaries, if this is what it\u2019s going to be, right?\n\nBrat: Well, yeah, I\u2019m\u2014and I don\u2019t even like\u2014because, if you say that, it has a certain meaning. But I don\u2019t endorse anyone. I didn\u2019t even endorse the president, right, and he\u2019s not happy with me about that. I\u2014\n\nDovere: He does keep track of who endorses\u2014\n\nBrat: Keeps track?\n\nDovere: [LAUGHS].\n\nBrat: And I supported him. I handed out stuff. I worked hard for him. But I don\u2019t endorse in any election, because I don\u2019t like cronies telling people who to vote for. And, so, I told the president, and he gets it. He says, \u201cWell, why didn\u2019t you tell me that ahead of time or whatever?\u201d See, he\u2019s funny. So\u2014\n\nDovere: [LAUGHS] Although the other day, when Rick Snyder, the Governor of Michigan, wanted to take a picture of him. He pointed out, \u201cYeah, you can come in the photo, even though you didn\u2019t endorse me.\u201d I\u2019ll never forget\u2014\n\nBrat: Really. Right.\n\nDovere: \u2014I don\u2019t know. Maybe you won\u2019t get your photo with him.\n\nBrat: No, he\u2019s got loyalty. He\u2019s a New Yorker. Right? The loyalty thing, it\u2019s a big deal. And, so, I understand that. That\u2019s okay. But in the end, also, what he learned is, those don\u2019t matter. Endorsements don\u2019t matter. I didn\u2019t have any endorsements, and I won by ten. I didn\u2019t have an endorsement. And my competition had every endorsement, so\u2014\n\nDovere: And, so, without supporting or not supporting people doing it, do you think it\u2019s going to happen more? Are there going to be more people who are\u2014\n\nBrat: Yeah.\n\nDovere: You do?\n\nBrat: I mean, there is already. The guys are telling me. There\u2019s primaries coming.\n\nDovere: People are coming to you for advice?\n\nBrat: No, I mean, I just hear my colleagues telling me.\n\nDovere: Okay.\n\nBrat: I got guys, you know, coming to challenge me, and some da da da da da. So there\u2019s the action on the left and the right.\n\nDovere: Right. No, it seems, among the Democrats, there\u2019s a lot of worry about ideological purity stuff, right\u2014\n\nBrat: Right. Right. Same thing. Right.\n\nDovere: It\u2019s as\u2014well, I feel like we\u2019ll have busy primary seasons\u2014\n\nBrat: Right.\n\nDovere: \u2014and busy general election season next year.\n\nBrat: I think so. No, I think so. Right.\n\nDovere: So I will tell you. I was a philosophy major in college\u2014\n\nBrat: Oh, good for you.\n\nDovere: \u2014and I do not usually get to talk about philosophy\u2014\n\nBrat: Yeah, good.\n\nDovere: \u2014in the course of my journalistic career. I want to bring you back to something that got a little attention a little while ago\u2014\n\nBrat: Right.\n\nDovere: Something you wrote in 2011.\n\nBrat: Yep.\n\nDovere: And I\u2019m just going to read it, because I don\u2019t want to mess it up. You were writing about Nietzsche.\n\nBrat: Yes. Yes.\n\nDovere: My\u2014as part of my undergraduate thesis, actually.\n\nBrat: Really? Good.\n\nDovere: So this is what you wrote. \u201cNietzsche\u2019s diagnosis of the modern Christian Democratic man was spot-on.\u201d\n\nBrat: Yep.\n\nDovere: You go on to write, \u201cJesus made things happen. Jesus had faith. Jesus actually made people better.\u201d\n\nBrat: Yep.\n\nDovere: And, then, the conclusion of that thought is, \u201cHitler came along, and he did not meet with unified resistance.\u201d\n\nBrat: Yep.\n\nDovere: \u201cI have the sinking feeling that it could all happen again, quite easily.\u201d\n\nBrat: Yeah.\n\nDovere: You wrote that in 2011.\n\nBrat: Yeah.\n\nDovere: Where has your thinking evolved on that. Are we just as vulnerable?\n\nBrat: Yeah. No, I mean, it\u2014\n\nDovere: Is your sinking feeling further sunk [LAUGHS]?\n\nBrat: Yeah, and it\u2019s not my idea. I mean, that\u2019s Plato\u2019s Republic, too.\n\nDovere: Yeah.\n\nBrat: Right? I mean, he says it\u2019s the decline from, you know, the philosopher, king, to aristocracy, and democracy\u2019s the fourth. And after Democracy, his diagnosis\u2014it\u2019s not Nietzche\u2019s diagnosis. It\u2019s, in some sense, reality. Just democracy, right, without principle, right. So all democracy means\u2014people think it means the government we have. It doesn\u2019t. All it means is majority vote.\n\nDovere: Right.\n\nBrat: And, so, majority vote without virtue. And he, Plato, had a thing where a guy runs into an ass, a mule, and apologizes to the mule. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, mule,\u201d right? Because everyone\u2019s equal. There\u2019s equal rights to the mule. And, so, if you descend in rationality to that point, where you cannot think anymore, your civilization is crushed. And, so, and that\u2019s the point. And Nietzsche said, you know, \u201cJesus was the great soul of man.\u201d That was his thesis. I obviously disagree with Nietzsche\u2019s atheism. So, just to make that clear to my listeners.\n\nBut his diagnosis\u2014\n\nDovere: [LAUGHS] Not on board with the syphilis.\n\nBrat: [LAUGHS] Yeah, not on board with\u2014all the crazy part. But his diagnosis of Western civ, I\u2019m saying, is spot-on.\n\nDovere: Right.\n\nBrat: And we\u2019ve become weak, and our kids don\u2019t know what human rights are anymore, and if you ask them, \u201cDo you believe in human rights, civil rights, women\u2019s rights, civil liberties?\u201d In class, I would ask people from every gender, ethnicity, everything, \u201cDo you believe in\u2014?\u201d And they would say\u2014the common response from the 18-year-olds now is, \u201cWell, I have my opinion, but you\u2019re welcome to have your opinion.\u201d And in a classroom setting, you mention tyrants, like Hitler and other tyrants in history, and you say, \u201cWhat if they oppose you? Are they welcome to their opinion?\u201d\n\nIn this modern, secular society, where all opinions are equal, do you really believe all rights and all opinions are equal?\u201d And they say, \u201cWell, I guess not.\u201d And I say, \u201cWell, I guess you better study hard and pick a system that you like here, right?\u201d And there\u2019s no such thing as ethics. There\u2019s Aristotelian ethics or Kantian ethics or Confucian ethics or Jewish ethics. But there\u2019s no such thing as ethics.\n\nAnd, so, that\u2019s what I\u2014that\u2019s what a liberal-arts education is supposed to do. You\u2019re supposed to\u2014I would always play the part of whatever philosopher, and they wouldn\u2019t know what I thought, and I\u2019d try to get them to like at least one system and then go on from there and learn, right? So, but, they\u2019re not taught any ethics in K to 12. And it\u2019s a fundamental problem we have with our culture right now.\n\nDovere: It\u2019s six years since you wrote that. Do you feel like we\u2019re further down\u2014\n\nBrat: Yeah. Oh, sure.\n\nDovere: \u2014the road?\n\nBrat: Oh, sure. I mean\u2014\n\nDovere: So, what is that\u2014I guess, what does that mean, when you say that we\u2019re vulnerable to Hitler, essentially? Like, what does that mean for where we are as a society, where we are as a culture?\n\nBrat: Yeah, well. We used to have these intermediating institutions, right? Tocqueville and these guys when they came over, you had the church, and the communities, and your bowling league, and the sports clubs, and all that. We\u2019re losing that. And you\u2019ve got what\u2019s-his-name, that\u2014from Harvard\u2014that wrote Bowling Alone.\n\nDovere: Putnam, yeah.\n\nBrat: Putnam and all this kind of stuff. And that\u2014I mean, I just found myself squarely in, that\u2019s what we have\u2014\n\nDovere: I guess, what I\u2019m asking\u2014do you think it\u2019s a metaphor? Is the Hitler, or is it really, like, you\u2019re worried about a dictatorship tapping into the weaknesses that you think we have as a culture?\n\nBrat: No, not\u2014I mean, we\u2019re not there. But we cannot keep going down the path we\u2019re on, right? K to 12, our education system. I think the Vietnamese, the bottom decile of Vietnamese outscored us. The bottom decile. In ninth-grade algebra, they outscored our average ninth grader. The PISA data, just came out a month ago. I think I got that right.\n\nDovere: Yeah. I\u2019m less up on that than on Nietzsche [LAUGHS].\n\nBrat: But it\u2019s stan\u2014it\u2019s just standard, right, and so our K to 12 system is teaching kids about isosceles triangles and whatever. But the kid doesn\u2019t know what a business is, when they graduate from high school. And if you ask them, \u201cWhat is your purpose in life?\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s your\u2014do you have any purpose?\u201d And, so, we\u2019re making kids memorize this stuff for their standardized test scores, and they\u2019re bored out of their gourd, because they don\u2019t know why they\u2019re studying it.\n\nYou say, \u201cWhat\u2019s your\u2014what\u2019s, you know, in my tradition, why did God put you here?\u201d Right? What are you doing? Right? What goal are you pursuing? Where are your special talents and attributes? How are you going to use them, you know, to help society? And we\u2019re not teaching that, because we\u2019re so P.C., and we\u2019re so scared to get it\u2014every\u2014those questions will lead into truth claims. And that\u2019s what I\u2019m scared of. If you no longer welcome the truth\u2014\n\nDovere: Well, I mean, that\u2019s\u2014it\u2019s why I have these questions about fake news and all this stuff. It does seem like we\u2019re\u2014\n\nBrat: Right.\n\nDovere: \u2014in that mix already.\n\nBrat: Right. Right. Right. Right. And that\u2014right. If you don\u2019t know\u2014I mean, Harvard\u2019s motto, in 1640, right, the oldest\u2014then was \u201cTruth for Christ and Church.\u201d You think that\u2019s Harvard\u2019s motto anymore? Right? Now it\u2019s lucky if it\u2019s Veritas. And if you go into a brown-bag seminar at Harvard or Yale or Princeton, they\u2019re all deconstructionists. If you mention the church or Christian doctrine or Jewish doctrine, they\u2019ll laugh you out of the room. If you mention natural law theory out of Aristotle, you\u2019ll get laughed out of the room. And that\u2019s what\u2019s going on at the highest levels, and they don\u2019t have a replacement.\n\nRight? So Karl Popper\u2014\n\nDovere: Right.\n\nBrat: \u2014he had falsification, right? Okay, so we can\u2019t agree on a positive project of truth, you know, logical positivism. And, so, let\u2019s\u2014is there anything still standing? And, on the left, conservatives, we say we have the Judeo-Christian tradition and Roth [ph]. You know, we\u2019ve got Immanuel Kant\u2014\n\nDovere: Right.\n\nBrat: \u2014as kind of a secular compromise. And the Jews and the Muslims and the Christians all got along, in the 12th century, with Aristotle, right? They all agreed, \u201cLet\u2019s do Aristotle\u2019s ethics. We\u2019ll differ on the religion, but let\u2019s just do Aristotelian ethics.\u201d What is the compromise today, with the left? Right? They had their convention four years ago, and they boo\u2019ed putting God in the platform. Right? And, so, what are they left with? And that\u2014it\u2019s a challenge in time. And, then, on the right, if you believe in God, you\u2019re called a judgmental something these days, for believing in the tradition that grounds our entire Western civ\u2014\n\nDovere: Right.\n\nBrat: \u2014which I find a little bizarre.\n\nDovere: [LAUGHS]. We\u2019re going to see a lot of this, I feel like, shape up in the budget fight over the course of the next couple of months.\n\nBrat: Right.\n\nDovere: Your initial read on the budget that came out of the White House is positive or negative?\n\nBrat: Well, that\u2019s the aspirational budget, first. Right? So that one is usually the cheerleading document. And, then, by the time you get to appropriations, you see the numbers and how it\u2019s actually going to work, and things will probably get plussed up beyond what that document says. So it\u2019s, you know, it\u2019s, as an aspirational document, it\u2019s not blowing all the numbers across the board, which is welcome. But we\u2019ll see. It all depends. When we get to the 12 appropriations bills, we\u2019ll see what they look like individual.\n\nDovere: All right. So last question, here. You were a teacher. If you had to write a course name for your syllabus\u2014\n\nBrat: [LAUGHS] that\u2019s a\u2014[OVERLAPPING]\n\nDovere: \u2014what the last couple of months have been, tell me what that would be.\n\nBrat: Well, I\u2019d throw in my Calvinism, of course, in total depravity, just for the humorous part. But, no, it\u2019s just\u2014it\u2019s the classics. This is the liberal arts education up here, I\u2019ve decided [ph]\u2014a cross-discipline view of politics and economics and culture and anthropology and everything.\n\nDovere: [LAUGHS] But to describe specifically these couple of months\u2014these first couple months?\n\nBrat: Oh, just these couple. Oh, man. You can\u2019t make that one up. I don\u2019t know. A Primer in Chaos Theory or something like that. I don\u2019t know. I mean, there are very few rules in place that we\u2019re all working from right now. I mean, it is wide open, right? There\u2019s a contest for what is the Republican Party. I mean, there\u2019s a contest for what is the Democratic Party. The independents and Bernie in the middle. There\u2019s a populism at play right now. The working class, the forgotten man is \u201cin\u201d right now. So that\u2019s all new. We\u2019ll see where that leads. I mean, that\u2019s what\u2019s coming. And I don\u2019t think anyone\u2019s charted it out accurately, yet.\n\nDovere: So \u201cA Primer in Chaos\u201d by Professor Dave Brat.\n\nBrat: Yeah. Right. [LAUGHTER]. That\u2019s it.\n\nDovere: Congressman Dave Brat, thanks for taking the time.\n\nBrat: Any time. Thank you.", 
        "body0": "On MSNBC\u2019s MTP Daily, Katy Tur turned Rep. Dave Brat (R-VA) into a far right conspiracy mess as the House Republican tried his best to defend Donald Trump.\n\nVideo:\n\nTur asked Rep. Brat (R-VA) if the American people should trust Trump. Brat tried to defend Trump on the wiretap.\n\nBrat said that everybody should put their chips on the table and there will be no news story.\n\nTur pointed out that FBI Comey was rather definitive that there was no wiretapping of Trump Tower.\n\nRep. Brat replied, \u201cYeah, and by who right?\n\nTur, \u201cBy who? By President Obama, which is what Donald Trump said.\u201d\n\nBrat tried to dig himself out of the hole, \u201cI agree with you on that. I think they\u2019ve walked that back. I don\u2019t think President Obama\u2019s following the president around.\u201d\n\nTur tried to come back with logic, \u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019ve walked that back. They certain haven\u2019t apologized for it. They haven\u2019t said no we don\u2019t believe President Obama wiretapped Trump Tower as President Trump claimed in a tweet on a Saturday morning.\u201d\n\nBrat then claimed that since there is an investigation, there is probably surveillance.\n\nKaty Tur asked Brat about the Trump conspiracy theories, and Rep. Brat blamed the liberal media. Brat said that people should look at the \u201cdonation tracks.\u201d\n\nTur asked, \u201cReally? Donation tracks?\u201d\n\nBrat then ranted about The Huffington Post and claimed that the Clinton Foundation was the same thing as Trump being under an FBI investigation.\n\nKaty Tur reminded Brat that the FBI is not investigating the Clinton Foundation, but they are investigating Donald Trump.\n\nTur reminded Brat that Hillary Clinton is not the president.\n\nRep. Brat was a fine example of House Republican who when confronted with reality, denied that reality by trying to change the subject by veering into wild conspiracies like the Clinton Foundation, Trump being cervelat, and the media being full of liberals.\n\nKaty Tur demolished Brat, not with bias, although that\u2019s what conservatives will claim. Tur made Brat look silly with facts.\n\nThe best to understand why Republicans are unlikely to get a health care bill passed is to listen to Brat\u2019s answers. The same group of Republicans who drove John Boehner out of the House is sabotaging any and all policy that doesn\u2019t conform to their ideology.\n\nThe dysfunction in Washington was never about divided government. The core of the dysfunction is, was, and will be a group of far-right radicals in the House of Representatives.", 
        "body2": "U.S. Rep. Stephanie Murphy, D-Fla., has teamed up with key Republicans on Capitol Hill to support a bill they hope will provide more federal subcontracts for small businesses.\n\nAt the end of last week, Murphy, the top Democrat on the House Contracting and Workforce Subcommittee despite being a freshman, paired up with U.S. Rep. Dave Brat, R-Va., and U.S. Rep. Steve Knight, R-Calif., to unveil a proposal amending the Small Business Act to give \u201cclear job description to Commercial Marketing Representatives at the Small Business Administration and help small businesses better compete for subcontracts.\u201d\n\nBrat, who made national headlines for beating former U.S. House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Va., in a major upset, chairs the House Economic Growth, Tax, and Capital Access Subcommittee and is the sponsors of the bill. Murphy and Knight, the chairman of the House Contracting and Workforce Subcommittee, are co-sponsors.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe federal government spends about $500 billion a year on federal contracts for goods and services, and Congress must ensure our nation\u2019s small businesses have a fair shot at federal contracts and subcontracts,\u201d Murphy said when they brought the bill out. \u201cI\u2019m proud to join Congressman Brat in introducing this bipartisan bill so small businesses have the resources and information they need to be competitive in federal contracting \u2013 allowing them to grow their business and their local economy. As a member of the House Small Business Committee and as ranking member of the Subcommittee on Contracting and Workforce, I\u2019ll continue to fight for small businesses in central Florida and across our country.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe must work to ensure Commercial Marketing Representatives (CMRs) require prime contractors comply with subcontracting requirements,\u201d Brat said. \u201cAll too often small businesses are unable to compete for subcontracts because they are not marketed by CMRs to prime contractors. Our small businesses and their entrepreneurial spirit are the backbone of economic growth in our country. I look forward to working in a bipartisan manner with my colleagues on the House Small Business Committee to pass this important clarifying legislative language to ensure small businesses can continue to provide value goods and services to Americans.\u201d\n\n\u201cSmall businesses are the backbone of our economy and it is imperative that we reduce barriers to accessing contracting opportunities,\u201d said Knight. \u201cI applaud Representatives Brat and Murphy for introducing this bipartisan measure that would provide clarity for our Commercial Market Representatives as they help our small business compete for subcontracts.\u201d\n\nThe bill was sent to the House Small Business Committee on Friday. So far, there is no Senate counterpart.\n\nREAD MORE FROM SUNSHINE STATE NEWS\n\nFlorida Delegation Unites in Urging Pentagon Homeport a Carrier at Mayport\n\nLegislation Will Help Save Community Pharmacies, Attention to Patient Care",

        "body0": "James Arthur at Shepherd\u2019s Bush Empire | Live review\n\nJames Arthur\u2019s journey of success after winning The X Factor in 2012 has not been an uncomplicated one. After his first single, a cover of Shontelle\u2019s Impossible, shot to number one on the charts, his career took a downturn when his reputation was besmirched by accusations of homophobia and racism due to vitriolic lyrics in his 2013 diss track to Mickey Worthless, entitled Hey Mickey. Arthur was dropped from Simon Cowell\u2019s label Syco and iTunes offered to refund purchases of his record owing to customer complaints at his words.\n\nBut Arthur is certainly in the midst of a comeback, as evidenced by the sales of his latest album, released in late 2016, titled Back From the Edge. Say You Won\u2019t Let Go, the lead single, has sold over two million copies worldwide, and the singer is once again performing at V festival this summer, as he did in 2013.\n\nLast night\u2019s gig at a sold-out Shepherd\u2019s Bush Empire also proved that the artist was back on form again. The set list was a mixture of tracks from Back From the Edge and his first album, the self-titled James Arthur, released in 2013. The songs ranged from rousing pop-rock to heartfelt ballads, addressing love, loss and his personal battle with drug addiction and depression. Arthur\u2019s voice is undeniably beautiful and switches between the genres easily, although his occasional rapping was less convincing.\n\nAfter the concert Arthur tweeted that it was one of the better crowds he\u2019d seen in London for a while, but the atmosphere was mixed. At one point he accused those assembled jokily of coming only to hear Say You Won\u2019t Let Go, but judging by the response to that song compared to the previous ones, that allegation seemed to hold some truth. The singer was also shown up slightly by the audience\u2019s enthusiasm during his cover of Clean Bandit\u2019s Rockabye, compared to the numbers played immediately beforehand. Performed at the end of the set, Say You Won\u2019t Let Go was the obvious highlight of the night, and everyone witnessed a very sweet moment where one of the concertgoers proposed to his girlfriend, which the singer-songwriter admitted made even him get choked up.\n\nOverall, the atmosphere was hardly electric but the crowd seemed to be enjoying themselves, and Arthur certainly looked more comfortable and happier than he has been in a while, having put his demons behind him \u2013 as his confessional songs documented. Despite some dull moments, his glorious voice made the evening certainly worthwhile.\n\n\u2605 \u2605 \u2605 \u2605 \u2605\n\nEmily Lawford\n\nFor further information about James Arthur and future events visit here.\n\nWatch the video for Say You Won\u2019t Let Go here:",

Though some Overwatch players have already seen what the new tank character has to offer in the games PTR, you can expect the Orisa update to land at around 6pm tonight. In all probability, Blizzard is also expected to reveal a full set of patch notes for the latest update. However, If you were planning on using the new Orisa character in Competitive Play right away, think again. you may be disappointed to know that you won\u2019t be able to that just yet.

They've explained that the reason for this is so that the developer can ensure everyone spends enough time with her in casual so that they can learn her abilities and how to best play as or counter her. Quick Play or Arcade mode is fair game though and no sooner that you've downloaded the update can you start using Orisa and her many skins in those modes. ou\u2019ll also be able to select Orisa in bot matches. You\u2019ll also be able to select Orisa in bot matches.\n\nNew Overwatch Hero: Orisa screenshots Tuesday, 7th March 2017 Take a quick look at the new Overwatch Hero, Orisa 1 / 6\n\nORIGINAL STORY Overwatch character Orisa is set to go live within 24 hours as the countdown until the newest hero's release date on PS4, Xbox One and PC draws closer. Blizzard revealed the character's release date last week, telling fans that Orisa would be released on March 21 alongside a new update to the game. A tweet from the official Overwatch social channel read: \"Join us for a behind-the-scenes look at Overwatch's newest hero! Orisa activates: 3.21.2017\". Though no release time has been given for Orisa, typically Overwatch updates go live around 6PM UK time. Blizzard has described the new tank character as the \"central anchor of her team\" who \"defends her teammates from the frontline with a protective barrier.\" \"She can attack from long range, fortify her own defences, launch graviton charges to slow and move enemies, and deploy a Supercharger to boost the damage output of multiple allies at once.\" You can get a better look at the character in the video below which offers a behind the scenes look at Orisa from the Overwatch team.\n\nOrisa is released into the game after some extensive testing on the Overwatch PTR (Public Test Realm) and according to Express Online, Orisa has been in the PTR testing phase \"longer than usual, as Blizzard felt the need to make lots of balancing tweaks.\" The new Tank-class fighter is actually available on the Overwatch PTR now. According to the game's director, Jeff Kaplan, the decision was made to leave Orisa on the PTR for a little while as the developers were \"getting great feedback and fixing a lot of issues.\" Kaplan did apologise for the slightly more lengthy testing period, but assured fans \"we think it will be for the better.\"", 
        "body0": "It\u2019s been a few weeks since Blizzard announced Orisa, the latest character to join the ranks of Overwatch\u2019s heroes, and starting today she\u2019ll finally be available on Xbox One, PlayStation 4, and the primary PC servers.\n\nOrisa is a tank-class hero, meant to help soak up damage and defend softer and squishier allies. Her Ultimate ability, Supercharger, also allows her to dish out a temporary damage boost for her teammates, which can help save a late-minute attack or repel a final desperate push on defense.\n\nBlizzard has had Orisa available on the game\u2019s PTR (Public Test Region) servers since the character was first announced to give players some time to see how Orisa fit into the overall metagame and ensure balance, but today marks her addition to the actual primary servers and consoles.\n\nOrisa won\u2019t be added to the ranked Competitive mode until next week\n\nThere is a slight catch, however: in order to give players time to adjust to Orisa, Blizzard won\u2019t be adding her to the ranked Competitive mode until next week. So players looking to try out the new hero will have to do so in the Quick Play, Arcade, and Play vs. AI modes for now.\n\nOrisa is available as part of patch 1.9, which should be rolling out to Overwatch players on PC, Xbox One, and PlayStation 4 now.",

For example, there are some pretty big balance changes to Ana, Sombra and L\u00facio on the way.\n\nHere's when you can expect to start downloading the new Overwatch update and take Orisa for a test drive.\n\nOverwatch Orisa release time\n\nIn the past, Overwatch updates have dropped in the early afternoon, around 2 or 3 p.m. Eastern. That will likely be the case with Orisa's release, too.\n\nBe warned: Blizzard recently announced Orisa will not be available in competitive play for a full week.\n\nSource: Play Overwatch/YouTube\n\n\"We want to give players some time to learn about and play Orisa before she's placed into the crucible of Competitive Play,\" Overwatch principal designer Scott Mercer wrote in a forum post. \"She'll still be immediately available in Quick Play, the Arcade (including custom games with the competitive ruleset) and Play vs. AI.\"\n\nIt's also likely Blizzard wants to make sure Orisa isn't wildly unbalanced before allowing players to use her in the high-stakes competitive mode. If they find any big problems, they'll probably tweak her stats once more before unleashing her on the competitive scene.\n\nAs soon as the update drops, we'll keep you updated with the full patch notes.\n\nMarch 21, 2017, 2:20 p.m.: This story has been updated.\n\nMore Overwatch news and updates\n\nFor more on Overwatch, check out the rest of what Mic has to offer.
