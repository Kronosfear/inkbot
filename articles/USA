Mike Huckabee, R-Ark., who moved to the Panhandle following his 2008 presidential bid. Huckabee has been active on the national stage since then, including hosting a national radio show and a TV show on Fox News. In 2016, Huckabee made a second presidential bid but fared far worse than he did in 2008, bowing out after a ninth place finish in the Iowa caucus which he won eight years before.\n\nFlorida Agriculture Commissioner Adam Putnam gets 13 percent of Florida Republicans while 6 percent former St. Petersburg Mayor Rick Baker. Florida House Speaker Richard Corcoran pulls 5 percent followed by state Sen. Jack Latvala with 3 percent. Physician Usha Jain, who ran for an Orange County Commission seat last year, gets 2 percent while 8 percent back other candidates. Jain is the only one of the Republicans included in the poll who has officially kicked off a gubernatorial bid.\n\nOn the other side of the aisle, 40 percent of Florida Democrats are unsure on who they are supporting for governor next year while 20 percent back former U.S. Rep. Patrick Murphy who was the party\u2019s unsuccessful candidate against U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., last year. Attorney John Morgan takes 9 percent followed by Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer with 6 percent. U.S. Rep. Kathy Castor and Miami Beach Mayor Phil Levine takes 5 percent apiece while two candidates based out of Tallahassee--former U.S. Rep. Gwen Graham and Mayor Andrew Gillum--claim 4 percent each. St. Petersburg Mayor Bob Buckhorn, who has said he will not run, gets 3 percent. Former state Sen. Jeremy Ring and Ft.

        "body1": "There\u2019s one job an NFL front office has that\u2019s paramount. It stands above the rest. Protect your franchise quarterback. Once you have been given the ability to actually feature a top-tier signal caller out there on a weekly basis, it\u2019s your job to make sure he has everything at his disposal to succeed and remain healthy.\n\nIt\u2019s an investment. Would you throw the equivalent of millions at a home without fire insurance? And once that home did burn to the ground, who would you blame for losing millions?\n\nProtecting your franchise quarterback is just as important. It\u2019s something we have seen teams focus on throughout the history of the league. With every great dynasty came an equally great offensive line.\n\nThe Pittsburgh Steelers of the 1970s wouldn\u2019t have been a dynasty if it weren\u2019t for the likes of Mike Webster and John Kolb along the offensive line. The same can be said for the San Francisco 49ers of the 1980s, Dallas Cowboys of the 1990s and the modern-day New England Patriots.\n\nBack in February of 2016, the Carolina Panthers entered Super Bowl LI against the Denver Broncos coming off a remarkable 15-win regular season. Cam Newton was just named league MVP the night prior. Everything seemed to be going in Carolina\u2019s direction.\n\nThat\u2019s when it seemed like the house that general manager Dave Gettleman and Co. built came crashing down like a house of cards built on a matchbook.\n\nNewton himself was absolutely brutalized in that game by the likes of Von Miller and DeMarcus Ware. In the end, he succumbed to seven sacks in an ugly 24-10 loss to Denver.\n\nThis was just the tip of the iceberg. Despite Carolina\u2019s success, one thing became readily apparent: It had not invested enough on the offensive line to keep its quarterback upright. On the field, this left the Panthers with a bitter taste in their mouth. It was also their way of building a house in the high desert with printing paper.\n\nMike Remmers was destroyed by Miller, who ended up earning the Super Bowl MVP award. Michael Oher, always a pedestrian offensive tackle in his own right, failed to do much of substance as well. It was the culmination of Carolina itself failing to protect its house.\n\nFast forward 13-plus months and the Panthers are coming off a disastrous six-win season. It was a year filled with concerns about Newton\u2019s health and the protection he received up front. Oher himself missed all but three games after suffering a concussion. Remmers struggled mightily replacing the former as Newton\u2019s blindside protector.\n\nThe season was defined by brutal hits on Newton, which began in the team\u2019s season-opening loss Denver. It was so ugly that those committing self-masochism by watching the game were left wondering just why Denver did Newton so dirty (more on that here).\n\n\u201cStop! Stop! He\u2019s already dead.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s what came to our minds as Denver laid the hammer down on Newton and Co. on that fateful Thursday Night Football Game. For the objective observer, we knew it was a sign of things to come. Within a month, the brutalized Newton would miss a game after suffering a concussion.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a shocking end result. It also led to a horrendous overall performance from Newton, who would go on to put up the worst statistical performance of his career.\n\nAn outlier of sorts for Newton, some wondered if the former No. 1 pick and league MVP just wasn\u2019t right throughout the season. We got that answer on Tuesday when the Panthers announced that Newton himself had suffered a partially torn rotator cuff and would need to undergo surgery (more on that here).\n\nAgain, this didn\u2019t seem to be too much of a surprise to the masses. Newton was sacked on nearly seven percent of his dropbacks last season. He was also hit at the third-highest clip of any starting quarterback in the NFL.\n\nThere\u2019s one common denominator here. Carolina simply failed to do anything of substance as it relates to finding him plus-level protection upfront.\n\nHeading into the 2017 NFL Draft, the Panthers have exhausted a total of zero Day 1 picks on the offensive line since Newton was selected first overall back in 2011. In fact, Carolina has spent one pick in the first two rounds over the past six years on the offensive line. That\u2019s what we would call failure in the most apt definition of the term.\n\nTo the Panthers\u2019 credit, they did dole out a huge sum of cash to a left tackle in free agency earlier in March. Even then, it seems to be their way of appeasing the masses with a necessary move, one that likely won\u2019t pay off in the end. The deal was with former Minnesota Vikings top-10 pick Matt Kalil. It cost Carolina $55 million over five seasons with $25 million guaranteed.\n\nIt was also handed to a player in Kalil who has been among the worst left tackles in the NFL since he jumped on to the scene as a Pro Bowl performer back in 2012.\n\nBefore his season-ending injury, Matt Kalil was @PFF's 65th ranked OT (out of 79) in 2016. He finished as their 34th ranked OT in 2015. \u2014 JR (@JReidDraftScout) January 7, 2017\n\nSo even as the Panthers made sure to address a need, they did so with one of the worst options on the free-agent market. Andrew Whitworth, an All Pro performer, took less for fewer seasons to sign with the Los Angeles Rams. Riley Reiff received a decent contract with the Minnesota Vikings. Both were much better options for Carolina. Instead, the team signed someone in Kalil who likely isn\u2019t an upgrade from either Oher or Remmers.\n\nMore than that, the Panthers exhausted this capital on a player that is relegated to left tackle only duties. Kalil cannot play right tackle. He doesn\u2019t have the build or athleticism for it. He\u2019s too upright to move inside. That\u2019s a concern teams had heading into the 2012 NFL Draft.\n\n\u201cThere are some concerns surrounding Kalil\u2019s ability to anchor and stall bull rushers, given his tendency to play upright. There were few examples of his anchor actually being an issue in college, but the limited level of knee bend he plays with could stand to be a concern,\u201d an NFL.com report read on Kalil leading up to the 2012 draft. \u201cHe rarely snaps his hips through when blocking in the run game and is more of a mirror/positional blocker. He could have to work on his knee bend and flexibility to take on the more explosive ends in the NFL.\u201d\n\nThis also limits Carolina\u2019s options when it comes to finding more upgrades along the offensive line during the draft. Will it exhaust a first-round pick on a player that will only suit up at right tackle? If not, can any prospect taken further down in the draft be asked to perform at a high level out of the gate?\n\nPanthers believe Cam Newton's March 30 rotator cuff surgery will sideline him about four months. \u2014 Adam Schefter (@AdamSchefter) March 21, 2017\n\nWith Newton now set to miss Carolina\u2019s OTAs and likely not set to return until right up to the start of training camp, there\u2019s huge concern here. This concern is more about Newton\u2019s current health. It\u2019s about the Panthers\u2019 inability (unwillingness?) to give him everything he needs to remain healthy and be successful.\n\nThis leads us to the unfortunate conclusion that Tuesday\u2019s news regarding Newton isn\u2019t going to be a one-off. It\u2019s not an outlier. Everything here is correlated. The Panthers have failed him at every turn, and it came back to roost big time.\n\nOne now has to wonder whether Gettleman and the rest of the Panthers\u2019 front office will be feeling the heat. Their house is burning down. They didn\u2019t buy insurance. And are they simply going to sit back and blame it on the inexperienced first responders for not acting in a timely manner?\n\nWe\u2019ll surely find out soon enough.",

All three are projected to return to action for the start of training camp.\n\nNewton is having surgery on his throwing shoulder at Carolinas Medical Center on March 30. The injury occurred against the San Diego Chargers in Week 14 of last season. Newton finished the game, and the following week, an MRI revealed a partially torn rotator cuff.\n\n\u201cIt is well-documented and well-researched that overhead throwing athletes commonly have wear and tear to their rotator cuffs,\u201d head athletic trainer Ryan Vermillion said. \u201cAs a result of the MRI, we modified all of Cam\u2019s work in the weight room and on the field for the final three weeks of the season.\u201d\n\nNewton did not miss any snaps in the remaining three games, and after the season concluded, a number of MRIs were performed to monitor his progress. Newton also saw a rehabilitation specialist in Atlanta who was in daily contact with Vermillion.\n\n\u201cWe developed a plan for Cam to take a period of rest, a period of rehabilitation and treatment, and then start a gradual throwing program the first part of March,\u201d Vermillion said. \u201cCam started his program, and the early parts of his rehab had been going well. However, as we worked to advance him into the next stage \u2013 the strengthening stage, the throwing stage \u2013 he started to have an increase in his pain level and started having pain while throwing.\n\n\u201cAs a result, Dr. Pat Connor (head team physician) felt the most prudent procedure would be to arthroscopically repair the shoulder.\u201d\n\nNewton has missed just three games in six NFL seasons. He underwent ankle surgery prior to the 2014 season, which is the only other the time he\u2019s been unavailable for OTA and minicamp practices.\n\nNewton has been working out throughout the offseason, and head coach Ron Rivera and general manager Dave Gettleman have indicated he\u2019s in tremendous physical shape. Following surgery, he will begin rehabbing the shoulder while continuing to condition his body for the 2017 season.\n\n\u201cThe thing we need to stay away from the most is throwing, but he will start immediately with range of motion and rotator cuff exercises,\u201d Vermillion said. \u201cThe positive thing, unlike when he had ankle surgery, is that he will still be able to work on his conditioning, work on his core, work on the rest of his body.\n\n\u201cTwelve weeks following surgery, Cam will begin an early throwing program with me. If he progresses well he will start throwing with the team at 16 weeks after surgery and we\u2019ll go from there. Our goal is to have him back at the start of training camp.\u201d\n\nJohnson, who is entering his 11th season, alerted the athletic training staff of back pain recently, which ultimately led to surgery at Carolinas Medical Center on March 21.\n\n\u201cWe began a normal course of action and treatment. He saw Dr. Connor, we did an MRI, and Charles received an epidural injection,\u201d Vermillion said. \u201cUnfortunately, he didn\u2019t get much relief from the injection and progressively worsened over the next few days. He saw Dr. Bruce Darden at OrthoCarolina, and we felt the best course of action was for Charles to undergo a microdiscectomy.\n\n\u201cFollowing surgery, we want Charles as active as possible while still taking the proper precautions. He will be up and moving around the next day, and we will progressively bring him back.\u201d\n\nByrd, who made his NFL debut in the 2016 season finale, injured his left knee while conditioning on his own according to Vermillion.\n\n\u201cWe saw him for treatment, but he continued to experience pain and swelling,\u201d Vermillion said. \u201cAn MRI revealed he has a torn lateral meniscus in his left knee, and Dr. Connor will perform a scope on his knee. We will modify what he does in our conditioning program, and he\u2019s projected to be ready to go later in the offseason.\u201d\n\nByrd will have surgery at Carolinas Medical Center on March 23.",

Winthrop had advanced to the prior three conference tournament title games and lost each one, its NCAA tournament aspirations snuffed by the final buzzer. The last time an Eagles team clinched an automatic bid -- in 2010 -- was an increasingly distant memory.\n\nPlayers weren\u2019t about to squander this chance.\n\nKeon Johnson scored a team-best 26 points and Xavier Cooks added 17 as Winthrop defeated Campbell 76-59 and punched one of the first tickets to the Big Dance. Joyful pandemonium ensued among the Eagles and their fans in Rock Hill, South Carolina.\n\nWinthrop head coach Pat Kelsey. (Lance King/Getty Images)\n\n\u201cWinning that game was so important for this team\u2019s legacy and their reputation. They were an unbelievably determined bunch. I could tell after the semifinal,\u201d Kelsey said. \u201cThere was a look in their eye, and they weren\u2019t going to be denied.\u201d\n\nKelsey showed similar grit when he helped Elder High School to the 1993 state basketball championship, when he played college hoops at Wyoming and Xavier, and when he coached on staffs at Wake Forest and Xavier.\n\nHis road to the Big South championship started long ago, during one of the toughest times in his life. Kelsey\u2019s mentor, former Xavier and Wake Forest coach Skip Prosser, died of a heart attack in 2007.\n\nThe pain of that loss devastated Kelsey so completely that he left his associate head coaching job with the Musketeers in 2011 and walked away from basketball for a year. He continued working outside the field and devoted time to introspection.\n\n\u201cI found after a year away who I was, and what my calling was in life and the world was: To be a teacher and a coach,\u201d Kelsey said. \u201cI recharged my batteries a bit and I was very fortunate to have the opportunity to become a head coach at a tradition-rich program at Winthrop.\u201d\n\nKelsey was introduced as Winthrop\u2019s head coach in 2012.\n\nHe hired Mark Prosser, Skip Prosser\u2019s son, as an assistant coach and set about impacting the Eagles\u2019 program while doling out \u201cProsserisms\u201d along the way. Skip Prosser\u2019s colorful quotes were frequent, often funny and immensely unique. They made Prosser a \u201cwalking Seinfeld episode,\u201d Kelsey said.\n\nOne of Kelsey\u2019s favorites: \u201cRecruiting\u2019s like shaving -- you do it every day or you look like a bum.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cHe could make a hilarious quick-witted comment about anything that\u2019s happening in a particular situation or instance. I just have a collection of those in my mind because being with him every single day, he was such an interesting and such a funny person,\u201d Kelsey said. \u201cThere were so many serious things that he said that applied to teaching and life and basketball as well that were so prophetic.\u201d\n\nPat Kelsey, head in hand in background, with his mentor at Wake Forest, the late Skip Prosser. (Craig Jones/Getty Images)\n\nKelsey, his wife Lisa, and their kids Ruthie, Caroline and Johnny live about 500 miles away from Cincinnati but remain tied to the area. Kelsey alone has an enormous extended family here, from parents and siblings to 56 first cousins.\n\nA slew of nieces and nephews made the trip to South Carolina to see the Eagles clinch the conference tournament title. So did Kelsey\u2019s basketball coach at Elder, Joe Schoenfeld, and his family.\n\nWinning three Big South tournament games in four days provided some relief for Kelsey and his players. Their successful season (26-6, 15-3 Big South) was brought to prominence and the program received the recognition it had long sought.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s in those empty locker rooms after those games when you realize what a hard journey that was, and you got that close and came up short, and then you realize how hard the journey is going to be again. There\u2019s no guarantee you can get back there,\u201d Kelsey said.\n\nBut the Eagles did return, and now they\u2019re enjoying a week of practice and publicity before the next part of their season begins. Winthrop will host a Selection Show party Sunday to unite fans and the team as CBS reveals the bracket.\n\nWhile other teams sweat out bids, the Eagles can rest easy knowing they\u2019re in the field of 68.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of cool. In every NCAA tournament show or preview that national radio talk shows do, or ESPN, there\u2019s always that category of Tickets Punched,\u201d Kelsey said. \u201cThe fact that our name\u2019s in there for the week every single time is good branding for our university and activation for our athletic department and our basketball program.\u201d",

The charges against him cast a shadow on the District Attorney\u2019s Office, our legal community and the entire City of Philadelphia. It truly is an embarrassment. Our District Attorney is the chief prosecutor in the City of Philadelphia. Such unethical behavior is unacceptable. Therefore, we call for his immediate resignation.\u201d\n\nWilliams announced last month that he would not seek reelection for a third term to a seat he has held since 2010.\n\n\"During my tenure, I have made regrettable mistakes in my personal life and my personal, financial life that cast an unnecessary shadow over the district attorney's office,\" Williams said during that announcement. \"My decision to accept gifts and fail to report them brought much embarrassment, shame and adverse publicity to me and unfortunately to the office for which I love.\n\n\"For this, I will always hold deep regret in my heart. My poor judgment caused distractions, which made the already difficult job of my assistants and critical staff even more challenging and raised doubts in the minds of some citizens regarding my character and my fitness to serve as your district attorney.\"\n\nWilliams made a name for himself for, in part, by prosecuting public officials who failed to disclose gifts, including taking up a sting operation that the Pennsylvania attorney general's office had chosen not to pursue.\n\nWilliams served as assistant district attorney and inspector general before he became the city\u2019s first African-American district attorney in 2010.

However, questions about the investigation dogged him as he tried to carry out his duties. The charges announced Tuesday also included honest services fraud.Special agents with the FBI, IRS and Department of Homeland Security declined to elaborate on the charges at an afternoon news conference. They would not explain, for instance, why the foreign traveler sought quicker screenings, but acting U.S. Attorney William Fitzpatrick of New Jersey said no security measures had been thwarted. His office supervised the case given Williams' work ties to Justice Department officials in Philadelphia.Williams failed to disclose five sources of income and 89 gifts on financial statements from 2010 through 2015 and omitted 10 items on an amended statement. The gifts also included sideline passes for Philadelphia Eagles games for several years, nearly $21,000 in free airfare, a free roof, and a $6,500 Rolex watch from a girlfriend.At the same time, he led a high-profile prosecution of Philadelphia lawmakers who had taken cash or jewelry, valued at perhaps a few thousand dollars, from an informant.\"My poor judgment caused distractions, and made the already difficult job of my ... staff even more difficult,\" Williams said.During his seven-year tenure, his office filed the first charges against several Roman Catholic priests and earned a trial conviction against the first U.S. church official ever charged over the handling of priest sex-abuse complaints. The conviction has since been overturned, although the official served nearly three years in prison.State laws require public officials to file annual reports and list gifts over $250. City officials cannot take anything worth more than $99 from anyone with an interest in any \"official action.\" Federal bribery laws typically involve a \"quid pro quo,\" or evidence the person got something in exchange for the gift.Williams grew up in Philadelphia and served as student president of Pennsylvania State University. He also teaches at a law school and serves in the National Guard.------", 
        "body2": "On whether or not the Philadelphia DA's office will recommend the possibility of parole for all juvenile lifers.\n\nPhiladelphia District Attorney Seth Williams took to the opinion pages of The Philadelphia Inquirer last week to defend himself from criticism that he reversed his stance on the individuals who have been deemed \"juvenile lifers\" in the criminal justice system.\n\nWilliams, a Democrat who is finishing out his second term as district attorney and will not seek re-election, apparently took issue with an early March Inquirer piece that indicated the DA had changed his previous stance on offering the chance of parole to those convicted of homicide when they were juveniles. In the piece, the Inquirer reported Williams and his staff intend to seek sentences of life without parole for at least three of the 300 Philadelphia juvenile lifers whose sentences are under review.\n\nThe district attorney wrote in that letter to the editor published last week that \"the article is contradicted by the paper's prior reporting\" and that his \"approach to these cases is fair, reasonable, and consistent with the judgments of the Pennsylvania legislature and the U.S. Supreme Court.\"\n\nSo did Williams reverse his stance or not? We decided to put it to the test on our Flip-O-Meter, which specifically tracks whether politicians have gone back on their promises. Let\u2019s look first at what Williams\u2019 stance on juvenile lifers was, and why it\u2019s been of interest over the last several years.\n\nIn 2012, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Miller v. Alabama that it\u2019s a violation of the Eighth Amendment for states to require a sentence of life without the possibility of parole for individuals convicted of committing homicide before they turned 18. The court ruled those sentences should be \"uncommon\" and reserved for \"the rare juvenile offender whose crime reflects irreparable corruption.\"\n\nBy the end of 2012, the Pennsylvania legislature passed new sentencing requirements for juveniles convicted of first- or second-degree murder, ranging from a 20-years-to-life sentence to a 35-years-to-life sentence, depending on degree and how old the person was when the crime was committed. That new legislation applied only to new sentences handed down after the Miller decision.\n\nBut things got complicated last year when the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the Miller v. Alabama decision to prohibit mandatory sentences of life without the possibility of parole for juveniles would apply retroactively. That set off a chaotic process in the criminal justice system that\u2019s being resolved by district attorneys, judges and criminal defense attorneys across the state resentencing individuals according to new requirements, but largely leaving it up to judge\u2019s discretion to make a final determination on each individual.\n\nThere were about 480 juvenile lifers across the state system; 300 of those are from Philadelphia. Last summer, Williams said in an Inquirer interview that it was his goal \"to give all of these individuals some light at the end of the tunnel.\"\n\n\"As long as I'm the D.A.,\" he said, \"we will not be asking for cases going forward for life without the possibility of parole for people under the age of 18 because of the same exact reasons articulated by the Supreme Court in Miller.\"\n\nThe promise earned Williams praise from progressive groups, and he was even lauded in a New York Times editorial that ended with: \"Now that Mr. Williams has put that principle into practice, district attorneys in other counties with large numbers of juvenile lifers have a clearer path to follow.\"\n\nIn the same Inquirer interview from last year, Williams said \"I've got a lot of people who are tweeting every day about juvenile lifers without parole.\" Some of them he even responded to.\n\nOn June 3, 2016, the district attorney tweeted to someone asking questions about his policy: \"we will have hearings for all 300 chronologically they will get new sentences that will allow for the possibility of parole.\" He even doubled down when the person responded, asking: \"does that mean the Philly DAs office will not seek LWOP (life without parole) in any of those 300 cases?\"\n\nWilliams tweeted back: \"just keep reading my last tweet.\"\n\nSo at the beginning of this month, the Inquirer wrote that it appeared Williams\u2019 stance had shifted. Journalist Samantha Melamed reported Williams\u2019 office, in a letter to a federal court, indicated it intends to seek life without parole in at least three of the cases it had reviewed so far.\n\nOfficials from Williams\u2019 office confirmed that this week, saying it\u2019s so far made 96 offers, three of which were for life without parole. They refused to provide any information about those three cases, saying the offers are still under consideration by defense attorneys and the final determination will be made by a judge.\n\nThe Inquirer reported one of the individuals who the DA\u2019s office is recommending life without parole for is Andre Martin, who was 15 when he shot and killed police officer John Trettin in 1976. From the story: \"According to Inquirer coverage from 1976, Martin had an IQ of 80 and was high on Valium and marijuana when he shot a police officer through the window of an apartment in a public-housing project.\"\n\nFollowing that March Inquirer story about Williams\u2019 apparent shifting stance, Williams wrote in a letter to the editor that there was no change in his stance and quoted the Inquirer\u2019s original June 2016 piece that read: \"[Williams] said he won't rule out life without parole in the most heinous cases, but he has taken heed of the Supreme Court's opinion, in Miller, that neuroscience shows teens' brains are not fully formed, reducing their culpability.\"\n\nMelamed said the Inquirer stands by its reporting, which is \"why the district attorney\u2019s claim appeared in the form of a letter to the editor rather than a correction.\"\n\nWilliams\u2019 chief of staff Kathleen Martin said in an interview this week that \"he hopes or expects not to have a lot of murderers who were juveniles remain, but in certain circumstances, including heinous crimes, that might in fact happen.\"\n\nShe described the office\u2019s process for reviewing each of the juvenile lifer cases, saying it\u2019s assigned a team of assistant district attorneys and other stakeholders to review every case, starting with the oldest ones. They\u2019re seeking out surviving family members of victims, combing through old case files and reviewing information from the Department of Corrections about how the inmates have operated in prison.\n\nAfter that process, the team determined that they\u2019ll request life in prison without the chance of parole for at least three juvenile lifers from Philadelphia. When PolitiFact asked Martin, Williams\u2019 chief of staff, about whether or not this move conflicts with Williams\u2019 past statements saying \"all\" 300 individuals would have a chance at parole, she said the three inmates in question still do have that chance because \"the judge is always going to have a final determination.\"\n\nBut that would go against what the DA\u2019s office is requesting. Martin also said Williams\u2019 original quote to the Inquirer that he wanted \"to give all of these individuals some light at the end of the tunnel\" was referring to his goals \"moving forward\" in sentencing new juveniles.\n\n\"It\u2019s clear that the DA had a goal, but in the most heinous occasions, that goal cannot always be met,\" Martin said. \"There are just unfortunately some cases in which the best interest of the community at large is that certain people remain in custody.\"\n\nOur ruling\n\nDistrict Attorney Seth Williams told The Philadelphia Inquirer last year that it was his goal \"to give all of these individuals some light at the end of the tunnel\" when it comes to re-sentencing juvenile lifers still in the Pennsylvania prison system. His office says he made clear there could be exceptions in the most heinous cases.\n\nThat\u2019s why Williams\u2019 team contends his stance didn\u2019t shift when it didn\u2019t offer the chance of parole to three individuals so far as it continues the process of reviewing 300 cases of juvenile lifers in Pennsylvania. But we keep going back to when he tweeted that \"we will have hearings for all 300 chronologically\" and that \"they will get new sentences that will allow for the possibility of parole.\" He then doubled down on that stance when asked directly about it on Twitter.\n\nThe district attorney also indicated he agreed with the Miller decision, and wouldn\u2019t seek life without parole for juveniles convicted of homicide moving forward. That\u2019s since changed for at least three people who could remain in prison for life without the possibility of parole.\n\nWe rate this a Full Flop.",

        "body1": "The NCAA bracket was released this weekend and oh, man does it look like fun. There are plenty of great story lines heading into this weekend. One of my favorites would be Michigan Tech elbowing their way into the tournament following a dramatic 2OT win against Bowling Green in the WCHA tournament final. After sweeping Bemidji State, Bowling Green came into the final against Michigan Tech riding a considerable amount of momentum. Michigan Tech played all three games against Minnesota State and by the time the final came around, no one needed to tell either team that the conference final would decide who went on the the NCAA\u2019s and who would watch. Tech would triumph in a wild 2OT affair, joining Western Michigan as the other Michigan school to make the tournament. Three Big Ten teams made the field of 16. Ohio State, Penn State and the fourth-overall seed, Minnesota.\n\nMy favorite story line heading into the tournament is Providence drawing the Providence region for the tournament. In any game they play they will definitely have the home-ice advantage. While Harvard is good, Providence will ride a strong roster and hometown advantage all the way to the Frozen Four. Denver will face a very good Union team in the second round and I think the winner of that game will beat Umass Lowell and advance to the national title game. Minnesota draws a Notre Dame team that is playing great hockey recently, Notre Dame wins then goes out and loses to Umass Lowell. WMU plays a pretty good Air Force team that simply won\u2019t have enough to overcome Western.\n\nIn short, my Frozen Four looks like this; Denver-Umass Lowell, Boston University-Providence will be the matchups in Chicago. Obviously, projecting the Frozen Four is tough but everyone loves a Cinderella. I\u2019ve got Providence and Denver advancing to the final at the Madhouse on Madison. Unfortunately, the clock is gonna strike midnight and Denver will win another national title.\n\nRegardless of how the tournament goes down, this is one of the funnest, most diverse brackets I have seen in a while. One of the really cool things about the 16-team field is that I have way less opportunities to be wrong. Given my luck with picks, I could go 0-8 in the first round though, who knows.\n\nSpartan News\n\nSurprisingly, there is no news to report. With a growing number of vacancies, it would seem that now is the time for Hollis to make the move on Anastos. There are a number of coaches who one would think are interested in a fresh start. Michigan State brings back a young, talented roster that even coaches who are currently employed would want to coach (although Northern Michigan\u2019s Walt Kyle certainly won\u2019t be an option). Schools have been parting ways with coaches who have had far more tenure and far more success. It should not matter that hiring college coaches can be a crap-shoot. Right now is absolutely the time for Anastos to be let go. The players on this roster deserve it, the athletic department deserves it and the fans deserve it. Frustration is through the roof with the state of Michigan State hockey. There is zero reason to exacerbate this frustration. There is talent on this roster and there is talent coming in. Get the right man behind the bench and there could be something really special to come in the next few years.",

(Photo: Eric Seals, Detroit Free Press)\n\nTom Anastos has stepped down as Michigan State hockey coach.\n\nMSU athletic director Mark Hollis said this Tuesday afternoon that longtime assistant coach Tom Newton will serve as interim coach while a national search is conducted to replace Anastos. Hollis said he has no successor lined up, nor a timeline for a hire.\n\nAn outside-the-box hire as the commissioner of the now-defunct Central Collegiate Hockey Association, Anastos was 78-122-24 in six seasons at MSU. The Spartans had the fewest wins of any NCAA Division I school in the state during Anastos\u2019 six-year reign.\n\nThe Spartans finished last in the six-team Big Ten standings this season. They were 7-24-4 overall and 3-14-3-1 in the conference.\n\n\"Tom's an amazing individual,\" Hollis said. \"The unfortunate part is wins and losses matter to a lot of people. I think Tom put out a timeline that just didn't meet expectations.\"\n\nFormer MSU assistant coach George Gwozdecky and former Spartans player Danton Cole, now a head coach with the U.S. National Team Development Program, likely top the list of replacements.

His best season was his first. The Spartans went 19-16-4 and made the 2012 NCAA tournament.\n\n\u201cWhen I first became head coach, I established my own timeline for the program\u2019s development,\u201d Anastos said in the statement. \u201cAfter a review of our season, and in spite of the progress we have made in so many areas, we have not met my expectations.\n\n\u201cAs a leader, I believe that you must always make every decision based on what\u2019s in the overall best interests of the program, and never put personal interests first.

He's a great guy, good coach.\"\n\nAnastos defended his plan in a January 2016 interview with the Free Press. \u201cYou have to peel back the onion to see some of the challenges and adversity we had to deal with as our plan has unfolded,\u201d Anastos said then. \u201cI think the plan was right, but during the course of time, sometimes things happen that make you reassess, re-calibrate, modify.\u201d\n\nAsked then whether he felt he was on the hot seat, Anastos said: \u201cI may be, but that\u2019s not for me to determine, so I don\u2019t give that much consideration. I\u2019m going to go do my job every day. To ask me that question is irrelevant. Maybe I am on the hot seat. But I don\u2019t think about that. I don\u2019t have time to think about that. One hundred percent of my energy goes into our team, preparing our team, looking ahead, working for the program.\u201d\n\nCole said he was on the ice when he heard Anastos was stepping down.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always been a Spartan and have always been a Spartan fan,\u201d Cole said. \u201cTom never had a bigger fan than me here in wanting to see the program do well. That\u2019s been a big part of my life.\n\n\u201cI love representing my country (in the National Team Development Program). This is a fabulous place here. It\u2019s an honor to do it on a daily basis. Your alma mater \u2014 that\u2019s always been a dream job.\u201d\n\nCole, 50, said he\u2019d be willing to serve in an advisory role, if asked. He played for the Spartans from 1985-89 and spent the past four seasons with the NTDP, after serving as coach at Alabama-Huntsville for three seasons (2007-2010). He also has coached the Muskegon Fury, Grand Rapids Griffins and Motor City Mechanics.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m available for them,\u201d Cole said. \u201cIt\u2019s a time for Spartans to pull together.\u201d",

Blizzard has described the new tank character as the \"central anchor of her team\" who \"defends her teammates from the frontline with a protective barrier.\" \"She can attack from long range, fortify her own defences, launch graviton charges to slow and move enemies, and deploy a Supercharger to boost the damage output of multiple allies at once.\" You can get a better look at the character in the video below which offers a behind the scenes look at Orisa from the Overwatch team.\n\nOrisa is released into the game after some extensive testing on the Overwatch PTR (Public Test Realm) and according to Express Online, Orisa has been in the PTR testing phase \"longer than usual, as Blizzard felt the need to make lots of balancing tweaks.\" The new Tank-class fighter is actually available on the Overwatch PTR now. According to the game's director, Jeff Kaplan, the decision was made to leave Orisa on the PTR for a little while as the developers were \"getting great feedback and fixing a lot of issues.\" Kaplan did apologise for the slightly more lengthy testing period, but assured fans \"we think it will be for the better.\"",

        "body2": "With Orisa's New Introduction Video, Overwatch Keeps Insisting That Junkrat Is Useful Posted on Tuesday, March 21 @ 14:00:00 PST by James_Kozanitis\n\n\n\nI know all the Overwatch news is surrounding the introduction of Orisa, Overwatch's new tank hero and the 24th on its roster, but I want to talk about another hero who has seen some changes this patch: Junkrat. Luckily for me, these two stories overlap.\n\n\n\nYou see, Junkrat has had a long history of being either undesirable or completely useless, and the Overwatch team has spent the better part of the last few months insisting that that isn't the case, including, in the video above, introducing a hot new strategy to make Junkrat useful. In the video, Orisa uses her halt ability to pull the enemy McCree, Hanzo and Symmetra into a tight area where Junkrat then detonates his explosive ultimate ability, the RIP-Tire, killing all three of them. POTG.\n\n\n\nThere are many problems with this. First off, I just want to offer my condolences to any team out there that has a McCree, Hanzo and Symmetra. Tough break.\n\n\n\nSecondly, it's becoming obvious that Blizzard has reached a breaking point when it comes to Junkrat. They must know he isn't very good, but they're desperately grasping at straws to make him look good. I thought they hit max desperation when game designer Geoff Goodman\n\n\n\nLet's forget, for a second, that you can sneeze on Junkrat's RIP-tire to destroy it before it ever gets a chance at a lethal hit, and let's focus on Junkrat's actual problems.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCredit where credit is due, the Overwatch team did make it so Junkrat no longer harms himself with his own explosions. Even though that never should have been the case to begin with, I still say thank you. This will make Junkrat a lot more viable in close-range duels which would usually end with a loss or a draw, so good on you. And Junkrat is very good at breaking down barriers, which, especially with Orisa's addition, is a huge benefit to a team.\n\n\n\nThat being said, the principal issue with Junkrat still hasn't been addressed. Most heroes have what you could call a counter, but it doesn't render them useless. That's not the case with Junkrat. If the opposing team has anyone that can do reliable burst damage, say a Hanzo, Widowmaker or Pharah, you might as well switch off. He does fine against tanks, and OK against close-range DPS heroes, but those burst-damaging heroes completely shut him down. He'll do fine at the lower levels of play, because teams are often reluctant to switch heroes or simply don't know how to shut him down.\n\n\n\nAnd then there's the issue of team composition. Junkrat fits in a strange category that makes him not quite a tank, not quite a DPS, certainly not a healer, and not really the best for defense. So he's going to take up one of those roles, which means you'll have one less. Do you really want a Junkrat instead of a second DPS like a Pharah? Do you really want him instead of a second tank or a second healer? Do you really want him over much stronger defense heroes like Symmetra, Bastion or even Torbjorn?\n\n\n\nProbably not. In fact, at tournaments, he's almost non-existant and picking Junkrat in standard competitive play is bound to induce at least one or two groans from your teammates in teamchat. At best, you'd rather have someone else. At worst, he'll get his face stomped into the ground repeatedly.\n\n\n\nThey need to do something to increase his survivability, perhaps by giving him some shields or armor, or maybe by simply increasing his health to 250. They also could do something to buff the RIP-Tire, itself. I would suggest making it explode when destroyed rather than simply evaporating. Changes like that would certainly make him harder to counter and more viable, but right now, no matter how much insisting Blizzard does by contriving ridiculous scenarios like the one in Orisa's intro video, he's not a good pick. I know all the Overwatch news is surrounding the introduction of Orisa, Overwatch's new tank hero and the 24th on its roster, but I want to talk about another hero who has seen some changes this patch: Junkrat. Luckily for me, these two stories overlap.You see, Junkrat has had a long history of being either undesirable or completely useless, and the Overwatch team has spent the better part of the last few months insisting that that isn't the case, including, in the video above, introducing a hot new strategy to make Junkrat useful. In the video, Orisa uses her halt ability to pull the enemy McCree, Hanzo and Symmetra into a tight area where Junkrat then detonates his explosive ultimate ability, the RIP-Tire, killing all three of them. POTG.There are many problems with this. First off, I just want to offer my condolences to any team out there that has a McCree, Hanzo and Symmetra. Tough break.Secondly, it's becoming obvious that Blizzard has reached a breaking point when it comes to Junkrat. They must know he isn't very good, but they're desperately grasping at straws to make him look good. I thought they hit max desperation when game designer Geoff Goodman insisted that players should make use of D.Va's defense matrix to protect Junkrat's RIP-tire. Don't worry, Goodman was appropriately ridiculed for that sound bite, which has since become something of a meme in Overwatch circles.Let's forget, for a second, that you can sneeze on Junkrat's RIP-tire to destroy it before it ever gets a chance at a lethal hit, and let's focus on Junkrat's actual problems.Credit where credit is due, the Overwatch team did make it so Junkrat no longer harms himself with his own explosions. Even though that never should have been the case to begin with, I still say thank you. This will make Junkrat a lot more viable in close-range duels which would usually end with a loss or a draw, so good on you. And Junkrat is very good at breaking down barriers, which, especially with Orisa's addition, is a huge benefit to a team.That being said, the principal issue with Junkrat still hasn't been addressed. Most heroes have what you could call a counter, but it doesn't render them useless. That's not the case with Junkrat. If the opposing team has anyone that can do reliable burst damage, say a Hanzo, Widowmaker or Pharah, you might as well switch off. He does fine against tanks, and OK against close-range DPS heroes, but those burst-damaging heroes completely shut him down. He'll do fine at the lower levels of play, because teams are often reluctant to switch heroes or simply don't know how to shut him down.And then there's the issue of team composition. Junkrat fits in a strange category that makes him not quite a tank, not quite a DPS, certainly not a healer, and not really the best for defense. So he's going to take up one of those roles, which means you'll have one less. Do you really want a Junkrat instead of a second DPS like a Pharah? Do you really want him instead of a second tank or a second healer? Do you really want him over much stronger defense heroes like Symmetra, Bastion or even Torbjorn?Probably not.

        "body1": "Men's Basketball Jarrett Allen Watch: Another mock draft, another move for Texas\u2019 freshman Posted March 20th, 2017\n\nIt\u2019s been one week since our last \u201cwhat is Jarrett Allen\u2019s draft stock\u201d article.\n\nIt\u2019s well established that the talented, 6-foot-11-inch center who was the best player on the court for Texas at the end of his freshman season is getting mixed reviews from NBA talent evaluators and draft gurus. (If they thought deciding his NBA stock was hard, try following his recruiting for a year).\n\nThat said, another worthy NBA mock draft was released just before the start of the NCAA Tournament last week by Sports Illustrated, and Allen has dropped out of the first round. Allen had been the outlet\u2019s No. 23 pick on the big board in its previous mock, but now finds himself with other enigmas like Indiana\u2019s Thomas Bryant and North Carolina\u2019s Tony Bradley.\n\nSome of the players Sports Illustrated does list would seem inferior to Allen if you just looked at the college numbers. Duke back-up center and former No. 1 prospect Harry Giles had about as disappointing of a season you can have after being a top recruit. Coming off back-to-back ACL injuries and missing huge chunks of the season, then being a rather non-factor for the Blue Devils this season, Giles is still listed at No. 13 Sports Illustrated\u2019s on the big board, as well as most other mock drafts.\n\nAllen averaged more points, rebounds and minutes than Giles, and both are 6-foot-11-inches tall.\n\nThe difference, though, is Giles\u2019 potential is as high as any player in the draft, something Sports Illustrated points out:\n\n\u201c\u2026 Giles has begun to show flashes of the player he was pre-injury. He rebounded well and stayed active in limited minutes at the ACC tournament, also blocking four shots against North Carolina. Although his performance alone this season doesn\u2019t inspire a ton of confidence, if his knees check out, it\u2019s easy to see a team gambling on his potential.\u201d\n\nAllen is off the two-round deep mock draft at Draft Express as well as SB Nation, which released a mock draft on Monday. The site that had been firmly on the \u201cJarrett Allen is lottery pick\u201d corner all season, www.nbadraft.net, no longer has Allen in its two-round draft.\n\nThe local product has some time to decide whether he wants to enter the NBA Draft. The deadline to declare for the NBA Draft is April 23. Then players have until May 24 to withdraw from the draft.\n\nOf course, Allen isn\u2019t obligated to announce whether he\u2019s returning or going publicly, though the longer Allen leaves Texas in the wind on his decision, the harder it\u2019ll be for the coaching staff to recruit any late players to Austin, if that happens at all.\n\nNews on Bevo Beat is free and unlimited.

        "body0": "Tony Gutierrez/Associated Press\n\nTexas forward Jarrett Allen will reportedly enter his name into the 2017 NBA draft process but will not hire an agent, according to ESPN's Jeff Borzello.\n\nWithout an agent, Allen will have the option of returning for his sophomore season.\n\nConsidered a potential late-lottery pick, Allen averaged 13.4 points and 8.4 rebounds as a freshman. The 6'11\" athlete also added 1.5 blocks per game and was clearly the most talented player on a Longhorns team that struggled its way to an 11-22 record.\n\nChad Ford of ESPN currently has Allen as the No. 16 overall player in the 2017 class.\n\nForegoing hiring an agent allows Allen to potentially return to Austin, provided he withdraws his name within 10 days after the draft combine. The NBA and NCAA worked together last year to push back the deadline to allow players maximum possible flexibility. A player can enter his name as many times as he desires as an underclassman as long as he does not have an agent but forfeits his eligibility if he hires representation.\n\nTalented but inconsistent last season, Allen is diving headfirst into perhaps the deepest class in recent draft history. Every player in Ford's top 20 is 20 years old or younger, with 19 of those players still being teenagers. It's possible that less than five upperclassmen are drafted in the first round at all, depending on who declares.\n\nThat will make the workout process critical for Allen, who could work his way into late-lottery consideration or slide to the late first round depending on his performance. The depth of this class is likely a deciding factor in him holding off on hiring an agent at this time; he should have a much better feel of his status by mid-May.", 
        "body2": "Men's Basketball What is Jarrett Allen\u2019s NBA Draft stock, really? Good question\u2026 Posted March 13th, 2017\n\nIf you\u2019re a Texas fan who likes mixing basketball with mystery, Jarrett Allen ought to be your favorite player \u2026 ever.\n\nIt started before he even arrived on campus, when the 6-foot-11 product of St. Stephen\u2019s Episcopal in Austin waited until June to pick the Longhorns. Now, the big question is whether he will return for a second season.\n\nRELATED: Shaka Smart, Longhorns face a critical offseason\n\nHere\u2019s the thing \u2014 and this should come as no surprise: Nobody knows.\n\nThe freshman was the lone consistent bright spot for Texas, which endured the worst season in program history with a record of 11-22. Allen averaged 13.4 points, 8.4 rebounds and pretty close to one show-stopping dunk and/or block per game.\n\nLonghorns fans are holding out hope that he comes back to be the backbone of a team high on youth and talent but low on confidence. Allen\u2019s response to questions after a season-ending loss to West Virginia in the Big 12 Tournament was about what one would expect from an NBA prospect.\n\n\u201cWe went through a bad season,\u201d Allen said, \u201cbut I\u2019m not going to let that impact my decision.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019d be wise not go poking around too many mock drafts and draft boards. NBA Draft experts seemingly have no idea what to do with Allen, which at the moment makes his situation a total mystery.\n\nTaking the money always seems life the safe bet, but is Allen even in position to be drafted? Is he a first-round pick? Lottery? No one seems able to agree.\n\nHere are a few examples:\n\n2017 NBA Draft projections\n\nConfused yet? Join the club.\n\nLuckily for Allen, a recent NCAA rule change allows college prospects to test NBA waters and still come back. He could participate in the NBA Draft Combine (May 9-14 in Chicago) without losing eligibility.\n\nGiven the uncertainty of his current situation, that path seems likely. However, because he possesses a rare combination of size and athleticism that NBA teams covet it is difficult to imagine a scenario in which he receives negative reviews at the combine.\n\nWhen it comes to Jarrett Allen, the mystery is half the fun.\n\nNews on Bevo Beat is free and unlimited.
