        "body1": "\"This is not a recommendation I make lightly, as the Chairman and I have worked together well for several years; and I take this step with the knowledge of the solemn responsibility we have on the Intelligence Committee to provide oversight on all intelligence matters, not just to conduct the investigation,\" Schiff said in a statement.\n\nBefore late last week, Schiff had gone out of his way not to be critical of Nunes throughout the fledgling investigation. They have held the top positions on the House Intelligence Committee for two years, and have served in Congress together for more than a decade.\n\nRep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Burbank) on Monday urged fellow Californian Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Tulare) to remove himself from their investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election.\n\nNunes last week surprised many when he told reporters that conversations between Trump and his transition team may have been accidentally picked up during legal intelligence gathering. Nunes briefed the media and President Trump before informing his committee.\n\nA spokesman for Nunes, who was a member of Trump's transition team, said Monday he obtained the information from a source on White House grounds, which raised even more questions. Nearly a week after Nunes' announcement, committee members still haven't seen the evidence, Schiff said.\n\n\"There was no legitimate justification for bringing that information to the White House instead of the committee. That it was also obtained at the White House makes this departure all the more concerning,\" Schiff said.\n\nNunes' spokesman would not comment on calls for the chairman to recuse himself.\n\nHouse Democrats have called for an entirely independent investigation, but short of that were coalescing around the call for Nunes to step aside.\n\nAmong others, Schiff's Intelligence Committee colleagues Reps. Jackie Speier (D-Hillsborough) and Eric Swalwell (D-Dublin) have also called for Nunes to step aside from the investigation.\n\nThe House and Senate intelligence committees are both investigating allegations that Russia tried to interfere with the presidential election and what, if anything, the Trump campaign knew about it.\n\n\"So far, too many people in the White House and administration, and now the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, have betrayed their duty to conduct an independent, bipartisan inquiry into the Trump team\u2019s ties with Russia,\" Swalwell said in a statement. \u201cChairman Nunes should no longer be anywhere near this investigation, let alone leading it.\"\n\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco) said in a statement that Nunes had \"tarnished\" the chairmanship. She also said it was \"long overdue\" for House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) to ask him to recuse himself from the investigation.", 
        "body0": "Someone needs to tell House Intelligence Committee Chair Devin Nunes to stop digging.\n\nNunes has faced sustained criticism for a bombshell announcement last Wednesday that an unnamed source had given him information that seemed to validate Donald Trump\u2019s baseless wiretapping allegations. Nunes later acknowledged he had no such evidence and apologized for personally briefing top White House officials about the supposed information before speaking to the rest of his committee.\n\nOn Monday, the saga got even stranger \u2014 and the Democratic leaders of the House and Senate bluntly said that Nunes couldn\u2019t be trusted to lead the congressional investigation into Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 elections. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer called for Nunes to be removed from his post, while House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, joined by Rep. Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said Nunes should fully recuse himself from the probe.\n\n\"The chair of the House Intelligence [Commitee] has a serious responsibility to the Congress and to the country,\" Pelosi said in a statement to CNN Monday evening. \"Chairman Nunes's discredited behavior has tarnished that office. [House] Speaker [Paul] Ryan must insist that Chairman Nunes at least recuse himself from the Trump-Russia investigation immediately. That leadership is long overdue.\"\n\nAs of late Monday night, a spokeswoman for Ryan said the embattled House speaker was still standing by Nunes, a seven-term Republican congressman who was a member of the Trump transition team, and would not ask that he recuse himself. But as every new twist of the Trump wiretapping scandal has shown, that type of assurance can quickly change.\n\nThings had begun to go off the rails for Nunes Monday morning after a strange statement from his spokesperson, Jack Langer. In the release, Langer acknowledged that Nunes paid an unannounced visit to the White House complex one day before personally telling Tump \u2014 and then the American public \u2014 that there were indications US spies had picked up communications involving Trump transition aides:\n\nChairman Nunes met with his source at the White House grounds in order to have proximity to a secure location where he could view the information provided by the source. The Chairman is extremely concerned by the possible improper unmasking of names of U.S. citizens, and he began looking into this issue even before President Trump tweeted his assertion that the White House had been wiretapped.\n\nThere were three eyebrow-raising things that in that quote. First, Trump\u2019s wiretapping charge was about Trump Tower, not the White House (a point Langer later corrected). Second, Nunes has access to a highly secure facility on Capitol Hill, so there would be no reason for him to head to the White House to safely view the source\u2019s purported evidence. Finally, the wording raises an obvious question: Did Nunes go to the White House because the source was a member of the Trump administration?\n\nNunes added to the confusion during an interview with CNN later on Monday when he took pains to say he\u2019d visited the White House grounds, but not the White House itself, and that he didn\u2019t believe Trump or top West Wing staffers even knew he was there. That seemed highly unlikely, since Nunes would have needed to be cleared into the complex \u2014 meaning that at least one senior White House staffer knew he was coming.\n\nDemocrats in both the House and Senate spent the day arguing that Nunes had shown himself to be incapable of leading an impartial investigation. Democrat Rep. Jim Himes of Connecticut told CNN that Nunes\u2019s actions were \u201cbizarre\u201d and \u201cloopy,\u201d while Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer urged House Speaker Paul Ryan to remove Nunes from his post on the intelligence panel.\n\n\"Chairman Nunes is falling down on the job and seems to be more interested in protecting the president than in seeking the truth,\u201d Schumer said. \u201cYou cannot have the person in charge of an impartial investigation be partial to one side. It's an inherent contradiction.\u201d\n\nThe sharpest dagger came from Schiff, the top Democrat on the House intelligence panel. A normally mild-mannered lawmaker, Schiff had worked hard in recent days to maintain a veneer of bipartisanship when it came to Nunes and the Trump wiretapping probe. That fell away Monday night, revealing a stark political divide about the future of the probe \u2014 and about Nunes\u2019s integrity and credibility.\n\n\"We've reached the point, after the events of this week, where it would be very difficult to maintain the credibility of the investigation if the chairman did not recuse himself from matters involving either the Trump campaign or the Trump transition team of which he was a member,\" Schiff told CNN.\n\nOne thing is clear: Nunes has spent more than a week trying to deflect attention from the FBI\u2019s bombshell announcement that it is formally investigating the Trump campaign\u2019s ties to Russia, but he\u2019s actually been making Trump\u2019s Russia problem even worse.\n\nThat\u2019s bad news for Trump, but it\u2019s even worse news for an ambitious lawmaker getting his first time on the national stage \u2014 and making so many missteps that he\u2019s now facing criticism from fellow Republicans, calls that he be replaced as head of the intelligence committee, and growing pressure for an independent probe that would bypass his committee entirely.\n\nThe head of the Trump-Russia probe is mouthing nonsense\n\nTo understand what\u2019s been going on, rewind the clock to last Monday, when FBI Director James Comey confirmed for the first time that the bureau was conducting a criminal investigation into \u201cany links between individuals associated with the Trump campaign and the Russian government\u201d and into \u201cwhether there was any coordination between the campaign and Russia\u2019s efforts.\u201d\n\nComey \u2014 joined by Adm. Mike Rogers, the head of the National Security Agency \u2014 also shot down Trump\u2019s allegation that then-President Barack Obama tapped his communications during the campaign. Both men flatly said there was no evidence to support Trump\u2019s claim, which had also been refuted by top lawmakers from both parties.\n\nEnter Nunes, whose committee is meant to be overseeing the congressional investigation into Team Trump\u2019s possible Russian ties. On Wednesday, he told reporters that an unnamed source had informed him that US spies had surveilled the Trump administration\u2019s transition team. He also acknowledged going to the White House to brief top officials there before talking to Democratic members of the committee.\n\nNunes provided no evidence to bolster Trump\u2019s initial accusations, and over the course of the week he started to hedge and walk back the claim that he\u2019d information that supported any part of the president\u2019s allegations. By Friday morning he was saying that he couldn\u2019t be sure that Trump\u2019s or his aides\u2019 conversations were captured by surveillance at all. Nunes also apologized to fellow members of the House Intelligence Committee for going to the White House in the first place.\n\nBut that wasn\u2019t the end of Nunes\u2019s Russia stumbles. On Friday, he infuriated Democrats anew by abruptly canceling a planned public hearing with top former national security officials about Russian interference in the 2016 election. The House panel was originally scheduled to hear from President Obama\u2019s former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, former CIA Director John Brennan, and former acting Attorney General Sally Yates on Tuesday.\n\nThe cancellation sparked a strong response from Schiff, the top Democrat on the committee, who took to Twitter to slam the move as an \u201cattempt to choke off public info.\u201d On Monday, Schiff, said Nunes should recuse himself from any further role in the investigation.\n\nArizona Republican Sen. John McCain cited Nunes\u2019s actions when he renewed his calls for a specially appointed and nonpartisan select committee to take over the Trump-Russia investigation from Congress: \"No longer does the Congress have credibility to handle this alone, and I don't say that lightly,\" he said.\n\nSome mainstream conservative media figures, like Morning Joe host Joe Scarborough, had an even stronger reaction than McCain. \u201cIf the Republican Party wants to do what is best for this country and its national security, they will remove Devin Nunes as Intel Chairman,\u201d Scarborough tweeted.\n\nIn a blistering editorial, meanwhile, the New York Times said Nunes had \u201cdestroyed the credibility of his committee\u201d and \u201c[made] clear that he is unfit for the job and should be replaced.\u201d\n\nAs my colleague Zack Beauchamp noted, sacrificing his credibility with Democrats and the Republican mainstream on the comparatively minor issue of Trump Tower surveillance means that Nunes has managed to create pressure to take the much more important investigation into Trump\u2019s Russia ties out of his hands.\n\nThat\u2019s bad news for Trump. In the short term, though, it\u2019s even worse news for Nunes.",

How can I cry tears of sorrow over the circumstances responsible for saving my soul? These circumstances are what has transformed me into a real man, how can I disrespect god by weeping over them? How much is a soul worth? Is a life sentence too high a price? Not at all, I gladly trade this false life in for the real one to come; I have been nothing but blessed by all of this. Now, if only I could somehow receive Christy's forgiveness... And if only I could one day hear that she too had been saved! That would remove every last bit of tarnish from this tragedy.

        "body0": "Ian Logue\n\nHere\u2019s a look at today\u2019s top stories:\n\nBrady Plans on Sticking Around For a While \u2013 People might still be wondering what type of time frame Tom Brady might have in mind in terms of how much longer he plans on playing football, and it sounds like anyone concerned about this era coming to a close any time soon might be able to rest a little easier.\n\nBrady had already made it clear that he\u2019s far from close to being done with the game and recently reiterated that to Robert Kraft, who said on Monday that the veteran quarterback plans on playing into his late 40s.\n\n\u201cAs recently as 2-3 days ago, he assured me he\u2019d be willing to play six to seven more years and at the level he performed,\u201d Kraft said Monday at the NFL\u2019s annual meeting via Mike Reiss of ESPN. \u201cThere\u2019s no one that would be happier than I, and our fan base.\u201d\n\nThe 39-year old turns 40 on August 3rd, starting both a new chapter in his life both on and off the field. As he waves good-bye to his 30s, he\u2019ll begin his journey down the road of what will most likely be the most scrutinized of his career. Crossing the barrier into that age group has usually spelled the beginning of the end for even the best quarterbacks, with none of them playing anywhere close to the level of what Brady did at the age of 39. Now the question will be whether or not one of the most consistent players in the game can carry his success into the next stage of his career.\n\n\n\nBrady and Kraft obviously share a special relationship.\n\nEveryone knows about his work ethic both in terms of how he approaches the game in his preparation and with how he takes care of himself. Kraft mentioned on Monday that Brady has been doing that since the beginning, which certainly speaks volumes about his success.\n\n\u201cI think Tommy\u2019s sustained excellence is just unbelievable,\u201d said Kraft. \u201cIt\u2019s a lifestyle. He\u2019s in training now, it\u2019s not like he\u2019s stopped. I remember after our first Super Bowl in \u201901 going down in the training room in the old Foxboro Stadium, three days after we won, he\u2019s in there with the music blaring working out. He\u2019s really dedicated. The thing that\u2019s amazing about him. To this day, he hasn\u2019t changed as a human being in how he relates to people, but also how he works out. The only thing that\u2019s probably changed is how he eats and his diet. I\u2019m not sure avocado ice cream is right for me, but if I could look like him and perform half as well, I guess I\u2019d do it.\u201d\n\nHow he performs at 40 will likely be one topic we\u2019ll probably hear quite a bit in the months ahead and expect the pool of sharks to continue grow. There have already been plenty of media both locally and nationally who spent all of last season circling him and waiting for him to fail, obviously looking to pounce while being the first to announce his demise.\n\nWe\u2019ve probably already missed out on many of them. If you could go back and dig out the stories written when the Patriots trailed by 25-points in the third quarter against the Falcons in Houston (or likely following the pick-six he threw in the first half), there were probably some nauseating ones. Fortunately those never saw daylight and instead they were ultimately crumpled up and thrown into the bin after Brady erased the deficit and brought the team back for a historic victory.\n\nBut there are likely some who still have one on their laptops half-written, knowing that day has to come eventually. Now it\u2019s just up to Brady to decide whether they\u2019ll ever be printed, or if he\u2019ll instead walk away at the top of his game before his critics ever get the opportunity to write his obituary.\n\n\n\nWhat does the future hold for Butler?\n\nKraft Hopes Butler is \u201cwith us\u201d \u2013 The situation with Malcolm Butler continues to drag on, but Patriots owner Robert Kraft told reporters on Monday that it remains his hope that Butler is still in New England\u2019s secondary in 2017.\n\n\u201cI know he has the ability to go out in the market and get someone to sign him, and then we either match it or get the first-round draft pick. \u201cI\u2019m rooting, I hope, he\u2019s with us and signs his [tender] and plays for us,\u201d Kraft said via the Boston Globe. \u201cI have a great affection for him. He was part of probably the greatest play in the history of our team, but there are a lot of people involved in that on both sides.\u201d\n\nWhen asked if the team intended to trade him, Kraft responded with a clear \u201cNo.\u201d\n\nThe Saints remain the team who appear to be the team Butler might be destined to end up, although despite a cryptic post on Instagram, nothing has materialized just yet. Multiple reports have indicated that the two sides having discussed possible parameters about a new contract, but the Globe reports that as of now, Butler hasn\u2019t received an offer sheet.\n\nHaving already signed Stephon Gilmore to a contract this offseason, New England\u2019s secondary will certainly have a different look to it next season. Whether or not Butler might still be a part of it remains to be seen, with the April 21st deadline for restricted free agents to sign an offer sheet with another team now less than a month away. After listening to Kraft, it sounds like the Patriots intend to continue to be patient while it plays itself out.\n\n\n\nCould Revis Return to New England?\n\nKraft on Revis: \u201cI would love it\u201d \u2013 With Darrelle Revis still without a football team, there are some who believe that a reunion in New England would make plenty of sense and Kraft certainly sounds like he might be open to the possibility.\n\nThe New York Daily News reported that Kraft said he has no problem with a Revis reunion, and wouldn\u2019t mind having him back.\n\n\u201cI would love it,\u201d Kraft said via Gary Myers of the New York Daily News. \u201cSpeaking for myself, if he wanted to come back, he\u2019s a great competitor, I\u2019d welcome him if he wanted to come.\u201d\n\nMyers also asked Kraft if there had been any contact, to which Kraft replied, \u201cAsk my boy,\u201d referring to Belichick.\n\nAs Myers points out, the Jets still owe Revis $6 million in guaranteed money and New York would owe him the balance of whatever another team pays him. That means that if the Patriots paid Revis the $1 million veteran minimum to return to Foxboro, the Jets would be on the hook for the remaining $5 million.\n\nThere\u2019s no love lost between the two organizations and it would certainly be fun seeing the Jets paying the salary of one of their key players during another championship run. For Revis, if he can\u2019t earn another big pay day, the next logical step would be the opportunity to add another piece of jewelry to his collection.\n\nEither way, for Kraft, it\u2019s up to \u201chis boy\u201d and after winning another ring without him, Revis no longer has the leverage he might have believed he had if he thought the Patriots couldn\u2019t win unless he was on their roster. Instead, Revis is just another player with an uncertain future who could end up being a spectator again in January while watching his old team make yet another run.\n\nKraft Calls Move For Patriots Getting Cooks From Saints \u201cExcellent\u201d \u2013 Kraft saw how things played out in 2007 after the team acquired Randy Moss and he seems pretty happy about the former Saints receiver being a part of his football team.\n\nKraft said Monday that he\u2019s been pleased with the personnel moves the team has made so far, and he\u2019s excited about what Cooks will bring to their offense.\n\n\u201cPart of it is the makeup of our team and the opportunities that have come along,\u201d Kraft said via the Boston Globe. \u201cI think what [the football staff] has done has been excellent, including getting [Brandin Cooks] from New Orleans. Since I\u2019ve owned the team the only player that could make an impact like that at wide receiver was Randy Moss. [Cooks] doesn\u2019t have his height but he looks like he\u2019s got his speed. So, I think that\u2019s complementary to what we have on the team and I\u2019m excited about that.\u201d\n\nAs for the guy who will be coaching these players, Kraft said he\u2019d like to keep Belichick around until \u201che\u2019s in his 80s.\u201d\n\nKraft Believes Giants Would Have Beaten them in Super Bowl XLI \u2013 According to Giants co-owner Steve Tisch, Kraft wouldn\u2019t have liked his team\u2019s chances against Tisch\u2019s Giants had they ended up facing each other in Houston in February.\n\nTisch said that Kraft told him just that, which he took as a compliment.\n\n\u201cBob Kraft after the Super Bowl told me, \u2018You would have beat us,\u2019 \u201d Tisch said via the New York Post at the NFL Annual Meeting on Monday. \u201cThat was a nice compliment.\u201d\n\nGiven New York\u2019s history in that game against the Patriots, Tisch admitted that he liked his team\u2019s chances.\n\n\u201cWhen I heard that, I agreed with him,\u201d said Tisch.\n\nGronk Anxious to Get Back \u2013 It\u2019s been a while since fans have seen Rob Gronkowski out on the football field and it seems like he\u2019s definitely motivated to get back out there.\n\nThe veteran tight end is continuing his rehabilitation coming off of a season-ending back injury last season, and although he\u2019s had some fun moments this offseason, he\u2019s looking forward to playing again.\n\nHaving fun and all these days but literally can't wait to compete again and play ball.

        "body0": "For years the national political organizations of both Democratic and Republican state attorneys general observed an agreement not to target the other party's incumbent office-holders in elections.\n\nThat hands-off stance ended this month when Republican AGs voted to abandon the agreement and spend money to help unseat Democrats in other states, according to the Republican Attorneys General Association. The decision has not been previously reported.\n\nThe move comes as Democratic attorneys general in states across the country have assumed lead roles in opposing some of Republican President Donald Trump's policies. State AGs in Washington and Hawaii successfully sued to block Trump's executive orders restricting travel from some Muslim-majority countries, and California's attorney general has pledged to defend the state's environmental standards.\n\nRepublican attorneys general who supported the change reasoned that AGs should join other national political campaigns which target incumbents, two sources familiar with the closed door process said. Additionally, a desire by some to roll back same-sex marriage and the potential for increased corporate contributions played a role in the decision, said the sources, who requested anonymity to discuss the deliberations.\n\nThe so-called 'incumbency rule' observed by the state attorneys' party fundraising arms reflected a rare bit of bipartisanship in the polarized environment of U.S. politics, aimed at promoting cooperation across state lines on issues of common interest, such as consumer protection.\n\nAttorneys general are the top public lawyer in each state, charged with defending state agencies from lawsuits as well as initiating litigation on their own. AGs took tobacco companies to court in the 1990s, and pursued mortgage lenders in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. In larger states, an attorney general commands hundreds of lawyers and other resources.\n\nTwelve Republican state AGs on Monday filed a federal appeals court brief supporting Trump's revised travel restrictions.\n\nScott Will, executive director of the Republican Attorneys General Association, confirmed the decision to abolish the incumbency rule, but declined to discuss specifics of the vote.\n\n\"The stakes are too high for us to leave winnable races on the table,\" Will said in a statement to Reuters.\n\nThe vote was taken over the phone with a tally of 15-8, the two sources said. Not every Republican AG participated.\n\nSome of those who supported the change argued that every other national campaign committee targets incumbents, so AGs shouldn't be any different, the sources said.\n\nThose opposed expressed fears about threats to bipartisanship, and noted that Republican AGs had grown their ranks under the current system, showing there was no need to change the rules now, the sources said.\n\nIn 2000, Republicans held 12 of the 51 state AG positions, including the District of Columbia, but that number is about to hit 29, if a nomination made by New Hampshire's Republican governor this month is confirmed.\n\nOne of the first fights after the rule change will likely come in Virginia, where Attorney General Mark Herring, a Democrat, is seeking reelection this November. In all, 31 AG elections are scheduled for 2018. Republicans currently hold 18 of those seats, compared to 13 for Democrats, but some of the incumbents may not run for re-election.\n\nKarl Racine, attorney general for the District of Columbia and current co-chair of the Democratic Attorneys General Association, said the Republican group's decision likely means Democrats will follow suit.\n\n\"What's good for the goose is good for the gander,\" Racine said in an interview.\n\nColorado attorney general Cynthia Coffman, a Republican, is up for election next year in a state that has been trending Democrat. A well-funded push to unseat her, something the Democratic AG group wouldn't have participated in under the incumbency agreement, could spell trouble.\n\nCoffman opposed the incumbency rule change, the sources said. Her office did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nCORPORATE PLEDGE\n\nIn laying out the reasons for the rule change, Will pointed to the key role Republican AGs played in opposing some of President Barack Obama's policies.\n\nRolling back same-sex marriage was another issue cited during deliberations, said the two people familiar with the discussion. More Republican state AGs could help further that effort, though the current composition of the U.S. Supreme Court would make any sweeping rollback unlikely.\n\nAdditionally, the group discussed a pledge from corporate interests to pour money into unseating Democratic AGs, the two sources said.\n\nParticipants in the vote were told that the group had received pledges totaling millions of dollars from organizations including from the company that makes the caffeinated beverage 5-Hour Energy, the sources said. The money depended on the Republican group changing its rules to target incumbent Democrats.\n\nThe company that manufactures 5-Hour Energy, Innovation Ventures, declined to comment. A spokesman for the Republican AG group declined to answer questions about the debate, including the role of 5-Hour's pledge.\n\nInnovation Ventures has been sued by attorneys general in at least five states for alleged deceptive advertising of its energy drink, with varied outcomes.\n\nLast month a Washington state judge issued a judgment against the company for nearly $4.3 million in one such case, brought by Bob Ferguson, the Democratic attorney general whose lawsuit caused a judge to block Trump's first travel restrictions. The company has said it would appeal the ruling. In at least two other cases, in Oregon and Indiana, Innovation Ventures prevailed. Oregon has appealed.\n\nThe precise dollar amount of the company's pledge to Republican AGs could not be determined, nor is it clear if it is the only company that promised a contribution to target Democrats.\n\nAlready, the Republican Attorneys General Association has built a fundraising advantage. In 2016, it raised about $14.5 million, including donations from companies and conservative interest groups like the Judicial Crisis Network and Koch Industries, according to tax filings.\n\nSean Rankin, executive director of the Democratic AG group, said it raised about $5.2 million in 2016. The group\u2019s tax filings show a mix of contributors including companies, plaintiff law firms and labor unions.\n\nInfographic ID: '2o6h4ZT'\n\n(Reporting by Dan Levine in San Francisco; Editing by Sue Horton and Paul Thomasch)", 
        "body2": "With Democrats outnumbered in Congress, a coalition of blue state attorneys general has emerged as the strongest resistance to Donald Trump\u2019s conservative agenda. Together they\u2019ve notched back-to-back victories against Trump\u2019s two attempts to instill a travel ban against several Muslim-majority nations. They now hope to build on that success to form a united front against Trump\u2019s expected efforts to roll back financial and environmental regulation, plus the GOP\u2019s planned repeal of Obamacare.\n\nIn February, Washington State Attorney General Bob Ferguson and Minnesota\u2019s Lori Swanson led the way in derailing Trump\u2019s first immigration order by persuading a panel of federal judges to block it from being enforced. Trump, rather than keep fighting, issued a revised order. That, too, was halted on March 15 when a federal judge in Hawaii ruled in favor of the state\u2019s attorney general, Doug Chin, who\u2019d sued on the grounds that the order was discriminatory. Both suits benefited from an increased level of coordination among Democratic state attorneys general, an effort that began before Trump\u2019s inauguration.\n\nFrom left: Healey, Ferguson, and Frosh. Photographers: AP Photo; Bloomberg; Getty Images\n\n\u201cWe had anticipated the administration might do something like this, and we\u2019d already started collaborating weeks before,\u201d says Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey, who joined the initial suit in February, along with New York\u2019s Eric Schneiderman and Maryland\u2019s Brian Frosh. When news broke of Trump\u2019s initial travel ban on Jan. 27, Healey, along with about 20 other Democratic AGs, was at a luncheon in Florida discussing how to join forces to take on the president.\n\n\u201cWe are now perceived by many to be the front line of defense,\u201d says Schneiderman, who clashed with Trump even before the election, when he sued Trump University for alleged fraud. (Trump agreed to pay $25 million to settle without admitting guilt.) \u201cThe solidarity among Democratic AGs and the mutual support has been tremendous.\u201d\n\nThe most important business stories of the day. Get Bloomberg's daily newsletter.\n\nThat solidarity was also on display in February at the National Association of Attorneys General winter conference at the Ritz Carlton in Washington, where a handful of Democratic AGs, including Healey, Schneiderman, and California\u2019s newly appointed Xavier Becerra, met privately on the sidelines and out of earshot of their Republican counterparts to talk strategy and tactics. Oregon Attorney General Ellen Rosenblum, who co-chairs the Democratic Attorneys General Association, says that since the election, Democratic AGs have almost daily conference calls.\n\nFrom left: Becerra, Chin, Rosenblum, and Schneiderman. Photographers: Getty Images (3); AP Photo\n\nBlue state AGs are also teaming up to fight Trump\u2019s efforts to cut environmental regulations. On Feb. 7, seven states with Democratic AGs joined California\u2019s Environmental Protection Agency in a joint letter to Congress challenging a plan to roll back safeguards for controlling methane leaks from oil and gas wells on public lands.\n\nDemocratic AGs are trying to replicate the success that their Republican counterparts had during the Obama administration, when a handful of red state AGs worked to thwart what they saw as the overreaching agenda of a president from the opposite party. Suing Obama on issues including immigration and health care boosted the political fortunes of a number of Republican AGs, including Scott Pruitt, who was Oklahoma\u2019s top law enforcement official when Trump tapped him to run the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, and Greg Abbott, who spent 12 years as Texas\u2019 attorney general before being elected governor in 2014. Serving as a state attorney general is \u201cprobably the most direct path to higher office,\u201d says Chris Wilson, founder of WPA Research, a political strategy firm.\n\nHe should know: His firm did polling and data analytics for Abbott\u2019s gubernatorial campaign. In Texas, Abbott was able to run on his record of suing a locally unpopular president more than 30 times. \u201cYou can build an entire campaign for higher office around that,\u201d says Wilson. \u201cThe flip side is that you\u2019re going to see a lot of Democrats angle for the same thing.\u201d\n\nBob Shrum, a veteran Democratic strategist who teaches political science at the University of Southern California, says that by notching wins against Trump, state AGs can help make up for Democrats being in the minority in Congress. \u201cThey can\u2019t upend the power relationship in Washington,\u201d he says. \u201cBut they can certainly impact it.\u201d\n\nThe bottom line: With Democrats out of power in Washington, state attorneys general have taken up the fight against Trump and the GOP.",

        "body1": "If the camera is the new keyboard, then the future of social media will look more like a slideshow than a Word document. So while Snapchat invented Stories, we\u2019ll have to get used to using them everywhere.\n\nWe can still praise Snapchat, or be pissed at Facebook for changing the apps we use every day, but we have to accept that this our reality now.\n\nFacebook popularized the algorithmically-sorted feed. Tinder popularized yes/no swipes with two-sided consent to connect. Blogger, blogs. Google, PageRank. ICQ, instant messaging. Many of the products we use today are based on broad concepts pioneered elsewhere. The first apps to borrow/steal/copy/\u201dbe inspired by\u201d might end up being called clones.\n\nYet eventually we stop assigning ownership to the originator and shame to followers, and start examining the intricacies of how a mechanic is uniquely implemented.\n\nFacebook hasn\u2019t been shy about this perspective. When Instagram Stories launched, CEO Kevin Systrom told me \u201cThis isn\u2019t about who invented something. This is about a format, and how you take it to a network and put your own spin on it.\u201d\n\nA few months late when Messenger Day launched, Facebook\u2019s VP of messaging David Marcus mirrored this sentiment, saying \u201cI think the Stories format is definitely a format, the same way the feed is a format. In different contexts as a format, it just makes sense. In my book, it\u2019s totally cool to look at what\u2019s working out there and try to adapt it to the platform you have.\u201d\n\nSystrom was more forthcoming with giving Snap credit while Marcus seemed to purposefully avoid mentioning the competitor by name in our interview. But both are aggressively pushing these photo/video slideshows in their own products, while WhatsApp added the format in a separate tab and Facebook continues to expand the test of its own Stories feature.\n\nThe world\u2019s most popular social media company wouldn\u2019t rapidly pivot its four top products towards Stories if it didn\u2019t see the format as the inevitable future of sharing. It\u2019s essentially communicating that \u2018We either get on board or we get passed by\u2019.\n\nNews Feed : Stories :: Text & Links : Photos & Videos\n\nWhen Facebook launched the News Feed in 2006, it was designed for desktop. It was great at letting you type out text statuses on your keyboard, and copy and paste links to other websites, because stuck at home on a computer, there was nothing else interesting to share. With its wide margins, it could splay out text and link blurbs horizontally so they were easy to skim as you scrolled. Photos were more cumbersome, requiring you to shoot on a digital camera and upload them to your computer before sharing them to Facebook.\n\nThat was fine before we all had smartphones. But now both Facebook and Snap are moving towards visual communication. Evan Spiegel wrote in Snap\u2019s IPO letter to investors that \u201cIn the way that the flashing cursor became the starting point for most products on desktop computers, we believe that the camera screen will be the starting point for most products on smartphones.\u201d And a week later, Messenger Day product manager Tony Leach told me \u201cWe like to think of the camera as the new keyboard.\u201d\n\nThat means the News Feed is outdated.\n\nVertical scrolling leaves gaps of blank space between photos and videos. They don\u2019t always show up full-screen by default. Skipping through dozens of them requires lots of thumb work.\n\nThe algorithmically-sorted News Feed that treats content shared minutes or hours apart as completely distinct also doesn\u2019t fit modern media creation behaviors. It worked better pre-smartphone, when we were typically sharing photos and videos as a batch long after they were taken. Social media consumption was sporadic, rather than a multiple-times-per-day activity, so content had to be permanent or most people might miss it.\n\nIn the early days of mobile, the camera quality, storage capacity, screen size, and bandwidth also limited how much content we captured. We typically only shared the big highlights of our lives that would still be interesting days or years later, and the norm wasn\u2019t to post multiple times per day. The feed didn\u2019t have to worry much about ranking different photos or videos from the same day in the wrong order, jumbling the narrative. You could think of this as the camera-phone 1.0 era (because those tiny sensors on old flip phones were more like 0.1).\n\nBut as our cameras, storage, screens, and networks improved, we wanted to capture more of our lives \u2014 the silly in between moments, not just the highlights. That meant the posts needed to be laced together into a cohesive tale, ensuring viewers have the context of our past posts before seeing the newest or most interesting ones. People embraced consuming social media constantly throughout the day. We began sharing more frequently, and to communicate in the moment rather than just to represent ourselves forever, so making the content permanent would just build up a trash heap of irrelevance.\n\nMeanwhile, typing became more cumbersome on mobile, as did copy and pasting links without multiple browser tabs on screen at once. When we\u2019re out on the go living life, we have more vivid, urgent things to share anyways.\n\nSo, presented with the terrifying fact that its main content sharing medium was woefully ill-equipped for the shift from keyboards to cameras, Facebook did what it\u2019s best at: adapting, even if its users don\u2019t always like it.\n\nMillions protested against the News Feed when it launched. But Facebook knew social networks would become more about sharing with others than just manicuring our own profiles\n\nAfter some huge missteps where it tried to just wrap its old website in an app via HTML5, Facebook made mobile the focus of its product and engineering teams and all its users followed\n\nWhen Facebook first recognized the dawn of the camera phone 1.0 era, it wisely bought Instagram even though it was already building a Facebook Camera app\n\nFacebook split chat off of its main app and forced people to download Messenger separately. Legions of users complained they didn\u2019t want another Facebook app\u2026until they realized just how much they\u2019d be messaging and that saving those few extra taps each time was critical.\n\nNow, Facebook\u2019s apps are adapting to Stories, because it\u2019d rather be called a copy-cat than a has-been.",

Alongside, it has unveiled Facebook Stories and Facebook Direct.\n\nWith an update scheduled to take effect on Tuesday, Facebook will allow users to get to the app's camera with one swipe of their finger and then add visual details like a rainbow or a beard of glitter.\n\nAs for Facebook Stories, users will be able to share multiple photos and videos as part of a visual collection on top of News Feed. These will be viewable for 24 hours, and will not be seen on the user's Timeline or News Feed unless the user posts them there. To add a story, users will need to click on the Your Story icon in the Stories bar on top of the News Feed.\n\nUsers will also be able to share a picture privately with a friend, rather than to the user's entire list of friends, using a feature called Facebook Direct. \"When you send a photo or video via Direct, your friends will be able to view it once and replay it or write a reply. Once the conversation on the photo or video ends, the content is no longer visible in Direct,\" the company says in its blog post.\n\nSnapchat, owned by Snap Inc, popularized the sharing of digitally decorated photographs on social media, especially among teenagers, and exposed a weakness of Facebook as the companies battle for eyeballs and leisure time.\n\nSnap, which went public this month, has recently emphasized its ambitions to build gadgets and has called itself a camera company rather than a social media firm.\n\nFacebook, the world's largest social network with some 1.86 billion users, denies it took its camera ideas from Snapchat and says it got them from Facebook users.\n\n\"Our goal here is to give people more to do on Facebook and that's really been the main inspiration,\" Connor Hayes, a Facebook product manager, said in a briefing with reporters.\n\nIn a glimpse of how the features could tie in with other businesses, one of the first camera effects will be the ability to morph someone in a photograph into a yellow, cartoon \"Minion.\" The latest Minion movie, \"Despicable Me 3,\" is due out in a few months from Comcast Corp's NBC Universal.\n\nFacebook has deals to license content from six film studios, as well as from two artists, said Kristen Spilman, design director at Facebook.\n\nAnother visual effect that can be added to pictures allows someone in a picture to \"become a laser cat with super powers,\" Spilman said.\n\nThe effects will vary by location. Spilman said that when Facebook tested the ability to add the phrase \"LOL\" - the acronym for \"laugh out loud\" - to a picture, users in Ireland were confused by what it meant.\n\n\"We hope that with the new Facebook camera, Stories and Direct, it will be easier than ever to see the world through each other's eyes, and we can't wait to see the photos and videos you create,\" the company's blog post said.\n\nWritten with inputs from Reuters",

        "body1": "Migrants in Jordan who flee abusive employers risk being imprisoned as illegal workers if they fail to find shelter with their embassies\n\nMaricel realised too late that the window had locked shut behind her. The 31-year-old Filipina was perched outside a second floor window, blood filling her mouth where two teeth had been smashed out. She had climbed on to the ledge to flee her employer, who had grabbed her hair and bashed her face into a wall, Maricel says.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so high. I want to go back, but the glass doesn\u2019t open. Madam is close. She is screaming, \u2018I kill you now!\u2019\u201d Maricel says. \u201cWhat can I do? I jumped.\u201d\n\n\n\nMaricel had arrived in Jordan three months earlier, one of the country\u2019s 50,000 migrant domestic workers. They travel from the Philippines, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Kenya, seeking jobs as caretakers, housekeepers and nannies to support their families at home.\n\nThe vanished: the Filipino domestic workers who disappear behind closed doors Read more\n\nMany get decent paid work; others are not so lucky. In a 2011 report by Human Rights Watch, half of the migrant domestic workers interviewed said employers or recruitment agency staff had physically or sexually abused them. Others have had their salaries and passports withheld, or live in poor conditions.\n\nIn the fall from the window, Maricel fractured her legs and spine but managed to make it to a nearby highway, from where a bus driver helped her to a hospital. After two months in hospital she was transferred by Jordanian public security to the Philippine embassy\u2019s shelter for abused migrants. She pressed charges and her employer was imprisoned in spring 2015.\n\nMaricel couldn\u2019t walk for six months. She has been in the shelter since February 2015, waiting for the legal case to be settled \u2013 her employer still has her passport and she will have to pay about 1,000 Jordanian dinars (\u00a31,130) for overstaying her visa. \u201cI just want to go home,\u201d she says.\n\nAbused migrant workers who escape their employers but don\u2019t find shelter with their embassy face imprisonment for being illegal workers. An estimated 37% of migrant domestic workers in Jordan work illegally.\n\nElizabeth, from Kenya, has been in the Juweida women\u2019s correctional and rehabilitation centre, in the south of Amman, for two weeks. \u201cI ran away because my madam beat me,\u201d she says, pulling her clothes aside to show bruises below her neck. Elizabeth is awaiting deportation but needs to pay her visa overstay fee first.\n\nShe shares a cell with 10 other Kenyans and an Ethiopian. Most are runaways; some have been accused of theft. \u201cBut they didn\u2019t steal. The madams in Jordan, they will say anything,\u201d Elizabeth says.\n\nUnder Jordanian law migrant domestic workers should be deported, not imprisoned, for violating labour or residency regulations, especially when they may be victims of trafficking and abuse, explains Linda al-Kalash, director of Tamkeen Fields for Aid, a legal centre for migrant rights in Jordan.\n\n\u201cThere is no article in the residency laws about imprisoning them. There\u2019s nothing about prison for someone who decided to break their work contract.\u201d\n\nSome domestic workers jailed for not paying visa overstay fines end up in detention for years.\n\nOf the 281 migrant worker detainees Tamkeen has interviewed, 55% were held between three weeks and four months, 18% for five to 11 months, and 5% for between one and two years.\n\nJordanian authorities say they are committed to protecting victims of trafficking. The country passed a counter-trafficking law in 2009 and has two shelters for victims of human trafficking, one run by the government and another by the Jordanian Women\u2019s Union (JWU).\n\n\u201cWe put victims in shelter, not prison. We\u2019re committed to stopping trafficking and to protecting these workers as guests,\u201d says Basel al-Tarawneh, the government coordinator on human rights. In 2016, the counter-trafficking unit investigated 30 confirmed cases of human trafficking and sent 196 victims, mostly domestic workers, to shelters. They also exempted 11 trafficked domestic workers from paying visa overstay fines.\n\nBut trafficking is narrowly defined in Jordanian law. Many cases of abuse don\u2019t qualify as trafficking, says Kalash, and then the victims go to prison instead of a shelter. \u201cIt may not be a trafficking case, but it\u2019s still abuse. There\u2019s no place for labour abuse victims, only prison.\u201d\n\nThe labour ministry says migrant workers who abscond must face some kind of penalty.\n\n\u201cWe have more than 50,000 maids in Jordan,\u201d says spokesman Mohammad al-Khateeb. \u201cSuppose 10,000 run away. If I arrest 50 or 60 every day, where should I put them?\u201d\n\nMany domestic workers are not victims of abuse, he adds, but run away because they want to make more money. When they become illegal they no longer come under the ministry\u2019s jurisdiction. If migrant workers choose to leave their employer and don\u2019t go through official channels then they have to face the consequences. \u201cWe need to have organised, legal labour,\u201d Khateeb says.\n\nMigrant workers who want to change employer must go through a formal procedure overseen by the Ministry of Labour. This is \u201cnear impossible\u201d for many migrant workers, says Kalash. \u201cAll the power is in the employers\u2019 hands as they must give consent for the worker to change jobs.\u201d\n\nDomestic workers cannot always rely on recruitment agencies for protection either. Martha*, a Kenyan domestic worker, came to Jordan in June 2015 and worked for a year without problems. She tried to change workplaces because her employer wouldn\u2019t cover medical fees when she got sick.\n\nMartha says her agency sent her to different Jordanian employers on short-term contracts, collecting money each time for her residency and work permits. But instead of processing her papers, Martha says, they kept the money and she became an illegal worker, liable for two years of visa overstay charges and with no residency permit.\n\nMartha says she was locked in an office room with other migrant women. \u201cThey would close the door at five and leave. After that one of the guys would come back and start molesting me. We were telling God to protect us. It was hell on earth.\u201d\n\nMartha eventually escaped to Tamkeen, which brought her to the JWU shelter. She was afraid to ask for police help, but thankful when authorities later intervened.\n\n\u201cWe fear the police,\u201d she says. \u201cBecause maybe the employer will say, \u2018She stole something\u2019, and they put you in jail.\u201d\n\nAfter receiving 960 complaints from domestic workers and dealing with 1,402 runaway cases in 2016, the labour ministry says it gave warnings to 27 recruitment agencies for misconduct and shut down eight agencies.\n\nKalash says that if domestic workers were allowed to change employers and had an official and trusted way to register cases of abuse, absconding cases would fall. \u201cNobody wants to be irregular. Everyone wants to be safe. You want to feel unafraid, not for anybody to arrest you, hurt you, exploit you \u2013 but right now in Jordan there is no chance for this.\u201d\n\n*Name changed to protect identity", 
        "body0": "Kids trapped inside a board game are forced to complete challenges in order to escape. Sound familiar?\n\nWell, if you guessed that it as the plot of the classic \u201990s film (and Caldecott Medal-winning book) Jumanji, you\u2019d be correct. But it\u2019s also the plot of Karuna Riazi\u2019s new novel, The Gauntlet.\n\nThe upcoming middle-grade book sees 12-year-old Farah, along with her best friends Essie and Alex, venture into the dangerous eponymous board game when her younger brother Ahmad gets sucked in. Once inside the magical world of Paheli, the kids have to work together to solve the various puzzles they encounter, in order to escape as well as rescue the other players trapped inside the game.\n\nThe idea for the novel first arose when Riazi was discussing the Robin Williams-starring movie with Dhonielle Clayton, one of the editors at Cake Literary, a boutique book development company headed by Clayton and fellow YA author Sona Charaipotra, who had been trying to pair the young author (who was their intern at the time) with a writing project.\n\n\u201cThey wanted to find an idea that I could work on that fit my voice,\u201d says Riazi of how the book first came about. \u201cJumanji is one of those \u201990s movies that was totally formative. So it ended up being one of those things where [Clayton and Charaipotra] really did an excellent job with an idea that matched my own strengths and enjoyment.\u201d\n\nThe novel isn\u2019t just Riazi\u2019s literary debut, but it\u2019s also the second book from Salaam Reads, a Muslim protagonist-focused imprint from Simon and Schuster.\n\nEW spoke to the debut novelist about crafting the world of The Gauntlet.\n\nENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY: Besides Jumanji, did you look at any specific board games for inspiration for the challenges the kids face?\n\nKARUNA RIAZI: I actually played a lot of board games around Farah\u2019s age, like Clue and Monopoly. [So] I was pulling on my love of board games, but at the same time, it was hard to find any real connection. It\u2019s funny, a few months after The Gauntlet was announced, I was playing Monopoly with my cousin and I put it on Instagram, and Dhonielle posted underneath, \u201cBet you\u2019re glad this game can\u2019t swallow you up. Hahaha.\u201d She thought it was so hilarious, but I started thinking, \u201cIf I got sucked into Monopoly, I would just go bankrupt within the next few days. It would be a totally miserable experience. There wouldn\u2019t be any good food.\u201d The Gauntlet is a game you do not want to see on the shelves of Target, and you couldn\u2019t imagine someone\u2019s aunt being able to find. So it was hard trying to find some sort of real-life reference besides Jumanji, because in that story, the main thing was there\u2019s this nefarious board game that\u2019s being passed around secretly, and you never know where it started out from. So I think The Gauntlet got the most inspiration from that.\n\nWith some of your descriptions of things, like the architecture within the game, it feels like you\u2019re pulling from examples in real life. Was that the case?\n\nIslamic architecture from the past is one of my favorite subjects, and I\u2019m glad [Salaam Reads editor Zareen Jaffery] indulged me and let me get away with a lot of descriptions. One of the particular forms of architecture that really inspired me for The Gauntlet\u2018s world, and particularly Paheli, was Moghul architecture because it was one of those Islamically dominant empires. Even in historical references, they discuss how it took from other forms of Islamic architecture. There are some Turkish influences and influences from other areas of the Middle East that came into this new form of architecture that was made into these palaces. The Taj Mahal is the huge recognizable one. But as a Muslim author writing in this really horrible political climate where a lot of Muslim kids are not made to feel welcome or at home, or no longer have a physical home to turn to, it was amazing that this architecture felt like welcoming people home. It was a beautiful thing to imagine \u2014 someone coming and seeing Moghul architecture from other areas of the world, you know how people used to travel back and forth, and seeing and realizing, \u201cThis kind of looks like my city back home,\u201d and feeling more welcomed and recognized there. That was a beautiful thing to be able to put into The Gauntlet, this meeting of cultures and welcoming of each other.\n\nOne scene that I loved and was really important for me to write was when they first enter Paheli. Farah is supposed to be scared and feel like this is a strange world that she\u2019s been pulled into. But still, seeing people dressed like people she knows, and having these cultural touchstones to identify them as Muslim or from areas of the world you would associate with being Muslim, she feels this sensation of being home or at least like there are people around her she knows. She knows she\u2019s not entirely lost. I felt that was so important to write and have there, particularly in this time when being Muslim hasn\u2019t been a pleasant experience since I grew up post-Sept. 11. It felt important to me to put in this different experience \u2014 that there is this girl, and when she sees people who look like her, it\u2019s a comfort and a revelation that this is not going to be so bad after all.\n\nUsually, adults in stories don\u2019t know about the adventures kids go on, but one of the things that\u2019s interesting about The Gauntlet is Farah\u2019s aunt, Zohra, knows how dangerous the game is, and still lets the kids go. How did you come up with that aspect of her character?\n\nAunt Zohra has been a really interesting character to develop. It didn\u2019t feel too odd for me to add her as an adult because I have a really huge extended family and a ton of aunts, so it felt really cool to be able to put an aunt in there. [But] she and Vijay are the \u201cAlan\u201d and \u201cSarah\u201d figures. He\u2019s the one that stayed in the game. She\u2019s the one who\u2019s left behind and confused. She knows there\u2019s something evil about it, but she doesn\u2019t know what else to do besides guard the game and try to keep it away from people. So that\u2019s all that she\u2019s been able to do with herself. It\u2019s kind of sad in a way because she did not get to move on from her childhood. She\u2019s staying with her sister\u2019s family, and she\u2019s just trying to look after her niece and her nephew, and she still feels almost, at first, like she\u2019s failed [because] the game gets the kids anyway. But it\u2019s a triumph for her, too, because she\u2019s able to tell them something of what to do to get Ahmad back. So she didn\u2019t feel like an adult character because she herself doesn\u2019t know what to do but it still felt important to put her there. She\u2019s kind of like the kid \u201cinterrupted\u201d in a way. She didn\u2019t get a chance to be fulfilled the way Farah is. She didn\u2019t get that chance to go and set things right.\n\nFarah also genuinely cares about her younger brother and is constantly thinking of him. How did you develop their relationship?\n\nThis is actually something I can attribute to the Bangladeshi side of my family, particularly my cousins. I\u2019m the eldest in my family, and we\u2019re always picking up the younger ones. It\u2019s not an uncommon thing for the youngest in the family to be hand-fed and everybody\u2019s worrying, like \u201cWatch out for the baby.\u201d It\u2019s this extended thing. We call our cousins our \u201ccousin brothers\u201d and \u201ccousin sisters.\u201d Because, you know, they\u2019re literally other siblings. Not to mention the fact that I have a younger brother. He\u2019s 15. When he was little, in particular, my sister and I were always behind him, and my mom called us his second moms because we were always worried about him. So maybe I didn\u2019t grow up with that feeling that you don\u2019t look out for your younger sibling. I couldn\u2019t relate to a lot of middle-grades books where the younger siblings get on your nerves. I won\u2019t lie and say that does not happen to me a lot, but there\u2019s more of a sense, particularly in the family at large, that these are the people you take care of. They\u2019re your buddies, they understand you, they\u2019re your blood. You don\u2019t turn your back on them and leave them to fend for themselves. Actually, we all kind of get along. Particularly the cousins. A couple of months ago my youngest cousin, he\u2019s 6 or 7, came over to one of my older cousins\u2019 house, and we were all just sitting and playing board games with him. He was just hanging out with us and chilling. That\u2019s probably the feeling that came through with Ahmad and Farah. That\u2019s what I wanted for them, to be able to work together and for it to be understandable that there\u2019s no way she\u2019s going to leave her brother in the game.\n\nThe Gauntlet is currently available for purchase. Order it here.", 
        "body2": "By Rachel Woodward, March 27 2017 \u2014\n\nFrom March 27 to April 1, music, dance and drama produced by University of Calgary students will showcase at various theatres across campus for the 2017 Taking Flight Festival of Student Work.\n\nU of C drama chair April Viczko says the festival is an important aspect of students\u2019 degrees because of the opportunity it gives them to work in multiple projects and take control over the work they create.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to allow students to participate in each other\u2019s projects,\u201d she says. \u201cTaking Flight has always been a completely student-driven festival. All of the work either comes out of a class or comes directly from students. The students in drama have always been very excited and very supportive about Taking Flight and that has spread throughout the school.\u201d\n\nThis year\u2019s festival will prioritize music and dance as well as its main focus on drama. Shows such as Dance@Noon and Dance@Night are events where dance will be a main focus.\n\n\u201cThis year is the first year that drama had dance and music added to this number of projects. The music projects that were scheduled for this time of year normally had their own programming along with the dance projects, so they would take place at the same time but would be under different umbrellas,\u201d Viczko says.\n\nThe festival will feature events at multiple locations on campus, including the Reeve Theatre, Matthews Theatre and Eckhardt-Gramatt\u00e9 Hall. The schedule is curated so that multiple shows of various disciplines could be seen by an audience member in one night. Viczko says that this is an important aspect of the festival\u2019s diversity.\n\n\n\n\u201cHaving things programmed so that a patron could go to a music event and then to a staged reading and then head over and see a play, really excites me. I think it\u2019s unique. I think it\u2019s worth the trip up to the university to see it,\u201d she says.\n\nThe events are all student-produced, including Scientific Americans, directed by Sarah Bannister and Shark Bite, directed by Alyssa Bradac. As a class, Drama 460: Performance Creation II will produce If it\u2019s ok, Can we Just, Talk about Debbie, For a moment, led by instructors Mike Czuba and Peter Balkwill. Graduate students in the drama department also created their works as a part of their pre-theses. Viczko says that she hopes the festival will pay tribute to the work happening on campus across the arts.\n\n\u201cMy hope is that audiences will be inspired and driven to come and see more work next year [and] that they will see the breadth of the work that happens with our students across disciplines,\u201d she says.\n\nThe Taking Flight Festival of Student Work will run from March 27 until April 1 at various locations across campus. Ticket prices vary, but is free with your student ID through the Claim Your Seat program.\n\nFor more information, visit scpa.ucalgary.ca\n\nComments",

        "body1": "'We were 60 seconds away from having him being prone out and us going up and putting handcuffs on him.' - Officer Jerrold Higginbotham\n\nQuanice Hayes had emerged, crawling on his knees as ordered, from an alcove of a Northeast Portland home on the morning of Feb. 9, 2016 as officers surrounded him and a police dog barked at him.\n\nAt one point, Portland Police Officer Andrew Hearst, with his AR-15 rifle pointed at Hayes, ordered the man suspected in an earlier armed robbery and attempted car jacking, to stop. Hayes halted, sitting on his knees, hands in the air, police testified to a grand jury.\n\nThen Hearst, stepping out from a flower bed about 15 feet away to the driveway in front of Hayes, commanded Hayes to lie face down on the driveway, his hands out to his side.\n\n\"Go down to your face. Hands out in front of you. Slowly go down to your face,'' Hearst said he ordered the suspect.\n\nHearst noticed Hayes' eyes darting around, and thought he was either looking for an escape route or an officer to shoot. Although Hearst never saw a gun on Hayes, he testified that he was sure Hayes had a firearm on him, since a witness had described a gun used in the robbery that morning and heard the suspect had run away from another officer earlier holding his waistband.\n\nHearst said he noticed Hayes drop his right hand to the small of his back. The officer said he was \"reeling from this reality'' that he had almost shot the man.\n\nThen Hearst did fire three shots, when he said Hayes brought his hand to the front of his waistband.\n\nHayes, wearing an olive green jacket and jeans, fell to his face. The 17-year-old died at the scene from a gunshot to just above his forehead on the right side of his head, one near the bottom of his left rib cage and one to his torso, an autopsy found. A replica tan and black air pistol was found in a flower bed, about two feet from Hayes' body, the lead detective testified.\n\nHayes' death has increased tensions between police and members of the African American community. After a grand jury concluded last week there was no criminal wrongdoing by the officer who fatally shot Hayes, a transcript of the grand jury hearings was released Monday.\n\nIt provided new details of the moments leading up to the shooting, and revealed a lengthy effort by police to track down the armed robbery suspect, and how officers who came upon Hayes were suddenly surprised to confront him.\n\nHearst, a seven-year bureau member who became a police officer after graduating from Multnomah University's bible college, said he never saw Hayes with a gun, but was trained not to wait to see one.\n\n\"Because if I let him get his hands on his gun, he will be able to pull that gun out and shoot me or my coworkers before I'm able to react to it,'' Hearst testified, according to the transcript. \"Yes with all of the information I knew up to that moment, there was no doubt in my mind he had a gun,and through his actions in those final moments, I believed that he was going to pull that gun on us. And to defend myself and my coworkers, I knew I needed to fire my weapon.''\n\nA Multnomah County grand jury met over two days to hear testimony in the police fatal shooting of Hayes. Toxicology tests showed cocaine, the tranquilizer benzodiazepine and a painkiller Hydrocodone in Hayes' blood. Hayes' family has called for a federal investigation.\n\nDOCUMENT: Grand Jury Transcript\n\nWhat started the search for Hayes was a report of an armed robbery outside the Portland Value Inn off Northeast 82nd Avenue. Victim Armando Suarez was sleeping in his car in the hotel lot when he awoke to knocking on his window. When he rolled the window down, he said a man shoved the barrel of a black and \"desert camouflage'' firearm in his face and said, \"You're lucky you're not dead right now because in Chicago, we shoot you first, and then we rob you,'' according to Suarez's grand jury testimony. He said the stranger got into his car, searched him and his car with the gun to his face. The gunman stole his Oregon Trail food stamp card and left, ordering him not to call the police.\n\nHearst, his partner Officer Ryan Mele, Officer Jerrold Higginbotham and canine Officer Robert Wullbrandt were the officers who ended up confronting Hayes as he emerged from the alcove of a home at 8301 N.E. Hancock St.\n\nThey had been searching, with the help of Wullbrandt's dog Billy, through yards in the neighborhood, and had been focused on the backyard of the Hancock Street home on two occasions. The dog was hitting on a shed in the rear yard, and officers had noticed a basement door window broken out, muddy boot prints at the top of the stairs and a handprint on a wooden railing that seemed freshly made. Officers had pushed on the basement door slightly and heard an alarm go off.\n\nHigginbotham came around to the front of the house to see if he could figure out the combination of a lockbox hanging on the front door. That's when he first spotted Hayes crouching like a baseball catcher in an alcove between the garage and a wall of the house.\n\nStartled, Higginbotham said he drew his handgun, pointed it at Hayes, ordered him to raise his hands in the air and yelled, \"He's out, He's out here!''\n\nHigginbotham backed away as other officers joined him. Wullbrandt on his right, Hearst to his left.\n\nHearst said he was kind of bumping into the shoulder of the canine cop.\n\n\"I kind of lower my rifle and step around him and take a position kind of in the flower bed,'' Hearst said, suddenly eye to eye with the suspect. \"Now he and I are looking right at each other , and I'm only about 15 feet away from him.''\n\nWullbrandt said he ended up about 20 to 30 feet from Hayes, his dog out in front of him in the driveway, barking at the suspect.\n\nWullbrandt said he ordered Hayes to put his hands in the air.\"Initially, he was not responding. I describe it as he was staring at us, but he was - it was almost as if he was looking through us. He wasn't acknowledging the commands that were being given to him...He was just staring past us, '' he testified.\n\nHayes had his hands shoulder height up, then finally put his hands all the way up, officers testified.\n\nWullbrandt said he didn't want officers to take Hayes into custody inside the small alcove because it was too confined an area and would be dangerous. That's why he ordered Hayes to crawl out towards the officers and the police dog. As he told Hayes to start crawling, he said Hayes popped up onto his feet. Stunned, the officers yelled again at Hayes to put his hands in the air, and he did, they testified.\n\nHayes started questioning the officers, saying something like, \" 'How am I supposed to, you know, crawl out if I've got my -without my hands on the ground,' ''Higginbotham recalled. So officers tried to clarify, ordering Hayes to keep his hands in the air, and walk out on his knees, Higginbotham said.\n\nThen Hayes began crawling toward the officers and suddenly stopped. Wullbrandt, whose dog was barking, said he didn't hear anyone command Hayes to stop. But Hearst testified that he had ordered Hayes to stop.\n\nWullbrandt said Hayes suddenly stopped, raised up on his knees and stared at the officers. \"And then all of a sudden, he dives his hands back down towards his waistband, and then I heard the shots fired,'' Wullbrandt said.\n\nWullbrandt did not have a firearm in his hand, only his dog on a leash about eight feet in front of him. Mele, armed with a 12-gauge, less-lethal shotgun, said he was near Hearst towards the front of the house but cautioning two officers in the backyard to stay back when he heard the shots fired. He said he saw Hayes on his knees on the driveway, and then sort of lunge forward.\n\nThe airsoft pellet gun found near Hayes was missing an orange marking on the tip, which is how it's sold to show it's a replica, not a real gun, Portland officers testified. It appeared to have been removed to make it look more realistic, according to the police testimony.\n\nHomicide Det. Erik Kammerer, the lead investigator in the case, said he believed the airsoft gun was either in Hayes' waistband or his pocket when he was shot, and either had his hand on it or was trying to retrieve it at the time he was fired upon.\n\nA grand juror asked how Kammerer came to that conclusion. Kammerer responded that nobody had seen the airsoft pistol at the location where it ended up until after the shooting.\n\n\"So based on the fact that nobody saw the gun there until afterwards, that's why I believe that he had it on him and was in the act of retrieving it at the time that he was shot,'' Kammerer testified.\n\nPolice determined that Hayes had been staying at a motel on Northeast 82nd Avenue, a few blocks north of where he was shot, for a night or two before his encounter with police. He had been reported as a runaway since the fall of 2016, Kammerer told grand jurors.\n\nJurors were told none of the officers involved wore body cameras, as the bureau hasn't equipped its officers with the technology.\n\nMoments before the gunshots rang out, Higginbotham said the officers were preparing to take Hayes into custody.\n\n\"We were 60 seconds away from having him being prone out and us going up and putting handcuffs on him,\" Higginbotham told jurors.\n\n-Oregonian Staff Writers Everton Bailey, Carli Brosseau and Rebecca Woolington contributed to this story.\n\n-- Maxine Bernstein\n\nmbernstein@oregonian.com\n\n503-221-8212\n\n@maxoregonian",
