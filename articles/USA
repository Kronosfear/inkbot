        "body0": "Lads  it s Stoke City  After the embarrassing exit from the Europa League on Thursday  Tottenham Hotspur eased back into Premier League action by thrashing their most submissive opponents  Mauricio Pochettino s team had beaten Stoke 4 0 in their two previous meetings and it took only one half for them to reach that score here  as Harry Kane struck three goals before inviting Dele Alli to hit another  If Wembley spooks Spurs  the sight of Stoke City jerseys cheers them right up   Spurs  in fairness  have clobbered most opponents at White Hart Lane this season  their tally for the Premier League campaign now standing at 11 wins and two draws from 13 matches  But few visitors have been as obliging as Stoke  who  seemingly unrefreshed by a break in Dubai began as if expecting another trouncing  That was a self fulfilling attitude that made them ideal opponents for a Spurs team eager to reassert their top team credentials after flopping out of Europe at Wembley   Tottenham Hotspur v Stoke City  Premier League   as it happened Read more   We never really got out of the traps   admitted Mark Hughes   We talked about having a bright start but that didn t materialise for us  Unfortunately we were a little bit too passive  At times we were just a little bit awestruck and had a little bit too much respect for them  Maybe some of the players had scars from the previous performances  against Spurs  but they shouldn t have because we have been in good form recently    The first sign of Stoke docility came in only the fourth minute  when Christian Eriksen nutmegged Ryan Shawcross in the box and rolled the ball across the face of goal  Fortunately for Stoke there was no Tottenham player there to complete a tap in but it was not long before Spurs players were infiltrating the area in swarms  Shawcross  for years the most formidable of sentinels for Stoke  was particularly discombobulated and Spurs  opening goal was a result of his confusion  As the defender tried to tidy up following another incursion by Eriksen in the 14th minute  Kane nicked the ball off him and lashed in a low shot from 15 yards   Stoke attempted to stammer a retort and  in fairness  presented a cogent argument in the 24th minute in the form of a flowing move down the left involving Ramadan Sobhi and Erik Pieters  Peter Crouch nearly topped that off with a telling finish from four yards but Hugo Lloris had the last word with a superb save   If that had gone in it might have stirred us from our slumbers   Hughes said  Spurs then settled the debate for good   Jan Vertonghen fired a shot against the crossbar following a corner by Eriksen  Moments later Kane was more clinical  His second goal came courtesy of a perfectly executed half volley from the edge of the area following an outswinging corner by Eriksen  The striker raised his left leg with the grace of a ballerina and then brought it cracking down like a lion tamer s whip as he sent a fierce and impeccably controlled low shot into the net   Manchester United v Southampton  EFL Cup final   live  Read more  Kane completed his hat trick five minutes later  this time with Lady Luck joining Eriksen on assist duty  The Dane rolled a free kick to the striker  whose strike from nearly 30 yards seemed unlikely to worry Lee Grant until it deflected off Crouch and carried on past the nonplussed goalkeeper and into the net   Kane may have had a hat trick under his belt but he continued to contribute to Stoke s debagging  He embarrassed Bruno Martins Indi with a cheeky piece of skill before racing towards the box in time added on at the end of the first half  Instead of shooting from a difficult angle he presented Alli with the easy task of stroking the ball into the empty net   Stoke  seemingly dazed by Spurs  speed and movement  looked like they could do with a break  and perhaps a lie down  They attempted to restore a measure of dignity in the second half  or at least preserve the ruins of it   Preservation was the name of Pochettino s game when he withdrew Vertonghen and Toby Alderweireld in the second half amid complaints of slight strains   Spurs did not over stretch themselves for the sake of a fifth goal  especially after Kane collided with a post while attempting to convert a header  Alli tried to double his own tally in the final minute but flicked a shot just wide from six yards   Alli s overall performance was bright   and unsullied by the sort of tackle that had earned him a red card against Gent on Thursday  Pochettino had words with him after that but would not disclose them here   They will remain private but you can imagine   he said before adding with a smile   I gave him more love than normal  He was very sad and disappointed  after Thursday  but he s only 20 years old  I will always protect and support him  He s one of the best young players in the world  Sometimes he can make mistakes but I want him on the pitch    The win lifted Spurs to within 10 points of league leaders Chelsea   The target is to keep winning and be there if anything wrong happens to Chelsea   Pochettino said  If only they could play Stoke every week ",

Dele Alli to hit another  If Wembley spooks Spurs  the sight of Stoke City jerseys cheers them right up   Spurs  in fairness  have clobbered most opponents at White Hart Lane this season  their tally for the Premier League campaign now standing at 11 wins and two draws from 13 matches  But few visitors have been as obliging as Stoke  who  seemingly unrefreshed by a break in Dubai began as if expecting another trouncing  That was a self fulfilling attitude that made them ideal opponents for a Spurs team eager to reassert their top team credentials after flopping out of Europe at Wembley   Tottenham Hotspur v Stoke City  Premier League   as it happened Read more   We never really got out of the traps   admitted Mark Hughes   We talked about having a bright start but that didn t materialise for us  Unfortunately we were a little bit too passive  At times we were just a little bit awestruck and had a little bit too much respect for them  Maybe some of the players had scars from the previous performances  against Spurs  but they shouldn t have because we have been in good form recently    The first sign of Stoke docility came in only the fourth minute  when Christian Eriksen nutmegged Ryan Shawcross in the box and rolled the ball across the face of goal  Fortunately for Stoke there was no Tottenham player there to complete a tap in but it was not long before Spurs players were infiltrating the area in swarms  Shawcross  for years the most formidable of sentinels for Stoke  was particularly discombobulated and Spurs  opening goal was a result of his confusion  As the defender tried to tidy up following another incursion by Eriksen in the 14th minute  Kane nicked the ball off him and lashed in a low shot from 15 yards   Stoke attempted to stammer a retort and  in fairness  presented a cogent argument in the 24th minute in the form of a flowing move down the left involving Ramadan Sobhi and Erik Pieters  Peter Crouch nearly topped that off with a telling finish from four yards but Hugo Lloris had the last word with a superb save   If that had gone in it might have stirred us from our slumbers   Hughes said  Spurs then settled the debate for good   Jan Vertonghen fired a shot against the crossbar following a corner by Eriksen  Moments later Kane was more clinical  His second goal came courtesy of a perfectly executed half volley from the edge of the area following an outswinging corner by Eriksen  The striker raised his left leg with the grace of a ballerina and then brought it cracking down like a lion tamer s whip as he sent a fierce and impeccably controlled low shot into the net   Manchester United v Southampton  EFL Cup final   live  Read more  Kane completed his hat trick five minutes later  this time with Lady Luck joining Eriksen on assist duty  The Dane rolled a free kick to the striker  whose strike from nearly 30 yards seemed unlikely to worry Lee Grant until it deflected off Crouch and carried on past the nonplussed goalkeeper and into the net   Kane may have had a hat trick under his belt but he continued to contribute to Stoke s debagging  He embarrassed Bruno Martins Indi with a cheeky piece of skill before racing towards the box in time added on at the end of the first half  Instead of shooting from a difficult angle he presented Alli with the easy task of stroking the ball into the empty net   Stoke  seemingly dazed by Spurs  speed and movement  looked like they could do with a break  and perhaps a lie down  They attempted to restore a measure of dignity in the second half  or at least preserve the ruins of it   Preservation was the name of Pochettino s game when he withdrew Vertonghen and Toby Alderweireld in the second half amid complaints of slight strains   Spurs did not over stretch themselves for the sake of a fifth goal  especially after Kane collided with a post while attempting to convert a header  Alli tried to double his own tally in the final minute but flicked a shot just wide from six yards   Alli s overall performance was bright   and unsullied by the sort of tackle that had earned him a red card against Gent on Thursday  Pochettino had words with him after that but would not disclose them here   They will remain private but you can imagine   he said before adding with a smile   I gave him more love than normal  He was very sad and disappointed  after Thursday  but he s only 20 years old  I will always protect and support him  He s one of the best young players in the world  Sometimes he can make mistakes but I want him on the pitch    The win lifted Spurs to within 10 points of league leaders Chelsea   The target is to keep winning and be there if anything wrong happens to Chelsea   Pochettino said  If only they could play Stoke every week ",

doesn t believe you any more   CNN was described as  very fake news  story after story is bad   The BBC was  another beauty    That night I did two things  First  I typed  Trump  in the search box of Twitter  My feed was reporting that he was crazy  a lunatic  a raving madman  But that wasn t how it was playing out elsewhere  The results produced a stream of  Go Donald       and  You show  em

for two and a half months now  I Googled  mainstream media is   And there it was  Google s autocomplete suggestions   mainstream media is  dead  dying  fake news  fake  finished   Is it dead  I wonder  Has FAKE news won  Are we now the FAKE news  Is the mainstream media   we  us  I   dying   I click Google s first suggested link  It leads to a website called CNSnews com and an article   The Mainstream media are dead   They re dead  I learn  because they   we  I    cannot be trusted   How had it  an obscure site I d never heard of  dominated Google s search algorithm on the topic  In the  About us  tab  I learn CNSnews is owned by the Media Research Center  which a click later I learn is  America s media watchdog   an organisation that claims an  unwavering commitment to neutralising leftwing bias in the news  media and popular culture    Another couple of clicks and I discover that it receives a large bulk of its funding   more than  10m in the past decade   from a single source  the hedge fund billionaire Robert Mercer  If you follow US politics you may recognise the name  Robert Mercer is the money behind Donald Trump  But then  I will come to learn  Robert Mercer is the money behind an awful lot of things  He was Trump s single biggest donor  Mercer started backing Ted Cruz  but when he fell out of the presidential race he threw his money    13 5m of it   behind the Trump campaign   It s money he s made as a result of his career as a brilliant but reclusive computer scientist  He started his career at IBM  where he made what the Association for Computational Linguistics called  revolutionary  breakthroughs in language processing   a science that went on to be key in developing today s AI   and later became joint CEO of Renaissance Technologies  a hedge fund that makes its money by using algorithms to model and trade on the financial markets   One of its funds  Medallion  which manages only its employees  money  is the most successful in the world   generating  55bn so far  And since 2010  Mercer has donated  45m to different political campaigns   all Republican   and another  50m to non profits   all rightwing  ultra conservative  This is a billionaire who is  as billionaires are wont  trying to reshape the world according to his personal beliefs   Facebook Twitter Pinterest Donald Trump s presidential campaigned received  13 5m from Robert Mercer  Photograph  Timothy A Clary AFP Getty Images  Robert Mercer very rarely speaks in public and never to journalists  so to gauge his beliefs you have to look at where he channels his money  a series of yachts  all called Sea Owl  a  2 9m model train set  climate change denial  he funds a climate change denial thinktank  the Heartland Institute   and what is maybe the ultimate rich man s plaything   the disruption of the mainstream media  In this he is helped by his close associate Steve Bannon  Trump s campaign manager and now chief strategist  The money he gives to the Media Research Center  with its mission of correcting  liberal bias  is just one of his media plays  There are other bigger  and even more deliberate strategies  and shining brightly  the star at the centre of the Mercer media galaxy  is Breitbart   It was  10m of Mercer s money that enabled Bannon to fund Breitbart   a rightwing news site  set up with the express intention of being a Huffington Post for the right  It has launched the careers of Milo Yiannopoulos and his like  regularly hosts antisemitic and Islamophobic views  and is currently being boycotted by more than 1 000 brands after an activist campaign  It has been phenomenally successful  the 29th most popular site in America with 2bn page views a year  It s bigger than its inspiration  the Huffington Post  bigger  even  than PornHub  It s the biggest political site on Facebook  The biggest on Twitter   Prominent rightwing journalist Andrew Breitbart  who founded the site but died in 2012  told Bannon that they had  to take back the culture   And  arguably  they have  though American culture is only the start of it  In 2014  Bannon launched Breitbart London  telling the New York Times it was specifically timed ahead of the UK s forthcoming election  It was  he said  the latest front  in our current cultural and political war   France and Germany are next   A determined plutocrat and a brilliant media strategist can  and have  found a way to mould journalism to their own ends  But there was another reason why I recognised Robert Mercer s name  because of his connection to Cambridge Analytica  a small data analytics company  He is reported to have a  10m stake in the company  which was spun out of a bigger British company called SCL Group  It specialises in  election management strategies  and  messaging and information operations   refined over 25 years in places like Afghanistan and Pakistan  In military circles this is known as  psyops    psychological operations   Mass propaganda that works by acting on people s emotions    Cambridge Analytica worked for the Trump campaign and  so I d read  the Leave campaign  When Mercer supported Cruz  Cambridge Analytica worked with Cruz  When Robert Mercer started supporting Trump  Cambridge Analytica came too  And where Mercer s money is  Steve Bannon is usually close by  it was reported that until recently he had a seat on the board   Last December  I wrote about Cambridge Analytica in a piece about how Google s search results on certain subjects were being dominated by rightwing and extremist sites  Jonathan Albright  a professor of communications at Elon University  North Carolina  who had mapped the news ecosystem and found millions of links between rightwing sites  strangling  the mainstream media  told me that trackers from sites like Breitbart could also be used by companies like Cambridge Analytica to follow people around the web and then  via Facebook  target them with ads   On its website  Cambridge Analytica makes the astonishing boast that it has psychological profiles based on 5 000 separate pieces of data on 220 million American voters   its USP is to use this data to understand people s deepest emotions and then target them accordingly  The system  according to Albright  amounted to a  propaganda machine    A few weeks later  the Observer received a letter  Cambridge Analytica was not employed by the Leave campaign  it said  Cambridge Analytica  is a US company based in the US  It hasn t worked in British politics    Which is how  earlier this week  I ended up in a Pret a Manger near Westminster with Andy Wigmore  Leave EU s affable communications director  looking at snapshots of Donald Trump on his phone  It was Wigmore who orchestrated Nigel Farage s trip to Trump Tower   the PR coup that saw him become the first foreign politician to meet the president elect   Wigmore scrolls through the snaps on his phone   That s the one I took   he says pointing at the now globally famous photo of Farage and Trump in front of his golden elevator door giving the thumbs up sign  Wigmore was one of the  bad boys of Brexit    a term coined by Arron Banks  the Bristol based businessman who was Leave EU s co founder   Cambridge Analytica had worked for them  he said  It had taught them how to build profiles  how to target people and how to scoop up masses of data from people s Facebook profiles  A video on YouTube shows one of Cambridge Analytica s and SCL s employees  Brittany Kaiser  sitting on the panel at Leave EU s launch event   Facebook was the key to the entire campaign  Wigmore explained  A Facebook  like   he said  was their most  potent weapon    Because using artificial intelligence  as we did  tells you all sorts of things about that individual and how to convince them with what sort of advert  And you knew there would also be other people in their network who liked what they liked  so you could spread  And then you follow them  The computer never stops learning and it never stops monitoring    Facebook Twitter Pinterest Steve Bannon  Donald Trump s chief strategist  is an associate of Robert Mercer  Photograph  Evan Vucci AP  It sounds creepy  I say    It is creepy  It s really creepy  It s why I m not on Facebook  I tried it on myself to see what information it had on me and I was like   Oh my God   What s scary is that my kids had put things on Instagram and it picked that up  It knew where my kids went to school    They hadn t  employed  Cambridge Analytica  he said  No money changed hands   They were happy to help    Why    Because Nigel is a good friend of the Mercers  And Robert Mercer introduced them to us  He said   Here s this company we think may be useful to you   What they were trying to do in the US and what we were trying to do had massive parallels  We shared a lot of information  Why wouldn t you   Behind Trump s campaign and Cambridge Analytica  he said  were  the same people  It s the same family    There were already a lot of questions swirling around Cambridge Analytica  and Andy Wigmore has opened up a whole lot more  Such as  are you supposed to declare services in kind as some sort of donation  The Electoral Commission says yes  if it was more than  7 500  And was it declared  The Electoral Commission says no  Does that mean a foreign billionaire had possibly influenced the referendum without that influence being apparent  It s certainly a question worth asking   In the last month or so  articles in first the Swiss and the US press have asked exactly what Cambridge Analytica is doing with US voters  data  In a statement to the Observer  the Information Commissioner s Office said   Any business collecting and using personal data in the UK must do so fairly and lawfully  We will be contacting Cambridge Analytica and asking questions to find out how the company is operating in the UK and whether the law is being followed    Cambridge Analytica said last Friday they are in touch with the ICO and are completely compliant with UK and EU data laws  It did not answer other questions the Observer put to it this week about how it built its psychometric model  which owes its origins to original research carried out by scientists at Cambridge University s Psychometric Centre  research based on a personality quiz on Facebook that went viral  More than 6 million people ended up doing it  producing an astonishing treasure trove of data   These Facebook profiles   especially people s  likes    could be correlated across millions of others to produce uncannily accurate results  Michal Kosinski  the centre s lead scientist  found that with knowledge of 150 likes  their model could predict someone s personality better than their spouse  With 300  it understood you better than yourself   Computers see us in a more robust way than we see ourselves   says Kosinski   But there are strict ethical regulations regarding what you can do with this data  Did SCL Group have access to the university s model or data  I ask Professor Jonathan Rust  the centre s director   Certainly not from us   he says   We have very strict rules around this    A scientist  Aleksandr Kogan  from the centre was contracted to build a model for SCL  and says he collected his own data  Professor Rust says he doesn t know where Kogan s data came from   The evidence was contrary  I reported it   An independent adjudicator was appointed by the university   But then Kogan said he d signed a non disclosure agreement with SCL and he couldn t continue  answering questions     Kogan disputes this and says SCL satisfied the university s inquiries  But perhaps more than anyone  Professor Rust understands how the kind of information people freely give up to social media sites could be used   Facebook Twitter Pinterest Former Ukip leader Nigel Farage is a friend of the Mercers  Photograph  Oli Scarff AFP Getty Images   The danger of not having regulation around the sort of data you can get from Facebook and elsewhere is clear  With this  a computer can actually do psychology  it can predict and potentially control human behaviour  It s what the scientologists try to do but much more powerful  It s how you brainwash someone  It s incredibly dangerous    It s no exaggeration to say that minds can be changed  Behaviour can be predicted and controlled  I find it incredibly scary  I really do  Because nobody has really followed through on the possible consequences of all this  People don t know it s happening to them  Their attitudes are being changed behind their backs    Mercer invested in Cambridge Analytica  the Washington Post reported   driven in part by an assessment that the right was lacking sophisticated technology capabilities   But in many ways  it s what Cambridge Analytica s parent company does that raises even more questions   Emma Briant  a propaganda specialist at the University of Sheffield  wrote about SCL Group in her 2015 book  Propaganda and Counter Terrorism  Strategies for Global Change  Cambridge Analytica has the technological tools to effect behavioural and psychological change  she said  but it s SCL that strategises it  It has specialised  at the highest level   for Nato  the MoD  the US state department and others   in changing the behaviour of large groups  It models mass populations and then it changes their beliefs   SCL was founded by someone called Nigel Oakes  who worked for Saatchi   Saatchi on Margaret Thatcher s image  says Briant  and the company had been  making money out of the propaganda side of the war on terrorism over a long period of time  There are different arms of SCL but it s all about reach and the ability to shape the discourse  They are trying to amplify particular political narratives  And they are selective in who they go for  they are not doing this for the left    In the course of the US election  Cambridge Analytica amassed a database  as it claims on its website  of almost the entire US voting population   220 million people   and the Washington Post reported last week that SCL was increasing staffing at its Washington office and competing for lucrative new contracts with Trump s administration   It seems significant that a company involved in engineering a political outcome profits from what follows  Particularly if it s the manipulation  and then resolution  of fear   says Briant   It s the database  and what may happen to it  that particularly exercises Paul Olivier Dehaye  a Swiss mathematician and data activist who has been investigating Cambridge Analytica and SCL for more than a year   How is it going to be used   he says   Is it going to be used to try and manipulate people around domestic policies  Or to ferment conflict between different communities  It is potentially very scary  People just don t understand the power of this data and how it can be used against them    There are two things  potentially  going on simultaneously  the manipulation of information on a mass level  and the manipulation of information at a very individual level  Both based on the latest understandings in science about how people work  and enabled by technological platforms built to bring us together   Are we living in a new era of propaganda  I ask Emma Briant  One we can t see  and that is working on us in ways we can t understand  Where we can only react  emotionally  to its messages   Definitely  The way that surveillance through technology is so pervasive  the collection and use of our data is so much more sophisticated  It s totally covert  And people don t realise what is going on    Public mood and politics goes through cycles  You don t have to subscribe to any conspiracy theory  Briant says  to see that a mass change in public sentiment is happening  Or that some of the tools in action are straight out of the military s or SCL s playbook   But then there s increasing evidence that our public arenas   the social media sites where we post our holiday snaps or make comments about the news   are a new battlefield where international geopolitics is playing out in real time  It s a new age of propaganda  But whose  This week  Russia announced the formation of a new branch of the military   information warfare troops    Sam Woolley of the Oxford Internet Institute s computational propaganda institute tells me that one third of all traffic on Twitter before the EU referendum was automated  bots    accounts that are programmed to look like people  to act like people  and to change the conversation  to make topics trend  And they were all for Leave  Before the US election  they were five to one in favour of Trump   many of them Russian  Last week they have been in action in the Stoke byelection   Russian bots  organised by who    attacking Paul Nuttall   You can take a trending topic  such as fake news  and then weaponise it  turn it against the media that uncovered it   Politics is war   said Steve Bannon last year in the Wall Street Journal  And increasingly this looks to be true   There s nothing accidental about Trump s behaviour  Andy Wigmore tells me   That press conference  It was absolutely brilliant  I could see exactly what he was doing  There s feedback going on constantly  That s what you can do with artificial intelligence  You can measure ever reaction to every word  He has a word room  where you fix key words  We did it  So with immigration  there are actually key words within that subject matter which people are concerned about  So when you are going to make a speech  it s all about how can you use these trending words    Wigmore met with Trump s team right at the start of the Leave campaign   And they said the holy grail was artificial intelligence    Who did    Jared Kushner and Jason Miller    Later  when Trump picked up Mercer and Cambridge Analytica  the game changed again   It s all about the emotions  This is the big difference with what we did  They call it bio psycho social profiling  It takes your physical  mental and lifestyle attributes and works out how people work  how they react emotionally    Bio psycho social profiling  I read later  is one offensive in what is called  cognitive warfare   Though there are many others   recoding the mass consciousness to turn patriotism into collaborationism   explains a Nato briefing document on countering Russian disinformation written by an SCL employee   Time sensitive professional use of media to propagate narratives   says one US state department white paper   Of particular importance to psyop personnel may be publicly and commercially available data from social media platforms    Yet another details the power of a  cognitive casualty    a  moral shock  that  has a disabling effect on empathy and higher processes such as moral reasoning and critical thinking   Something like immigration  perhaps  Or  fake news   Or as it has now become   FAKE news       How do you change the way a nation thinks  You could start by creating a mainstream media to replace the existing one with a site such as Breitbart  You could set up other websites that displace mainstream sources of news and information with your own definitions of concepts like  liberal media bias   like CNSnews com  And you could give the rump mainstream media  papers like the  failing New York Times   what it wants  stories  Because the third prong of Mercer and Bannon s media empire is the Government Accountability Institute   Bannon co founded it with  2m of Mercer s money  Mercer s daughter  Rebekah  was appointed to the board  Then they invested in expensive  long term investigative journalism   The modern economics of the newsroom don t support big investigative reporting staffs   Bannon told Forbes magazine   You wouldn t get a Watergate  a Pentagon Papers today  because nobody can afford to let a reporter spend seven months on a story  We can  We re working as a support function    Welcome to the future of journalism in the age of platform capitalism  News organisations have to do a better job of creating new financial models  But in the gaps in between  a determined plutocrat and a brilliant media strategist can  and have  found a way to mould journalism to their own ends   In 2015  Steve Bannon described to Forbes how the GAI operated  employing a data scientist to trawl the dark web  in the article he boasts of having access to  1 3bn worth of supercomputers  to dig up the kind of source material Google can t find  One result has been a New York Times bestseller  Clinton Cash  The Untold Story of How and Why Foreign Governments and Businesses Helped Make Bill and Hillary Rich  written by GAI s president  Peter Schweizer and later turned into a film produced by Rebekah Mercer and Steve Bannon   This  Bannon explained  is how you  weaponise  the narrative you want  With hard researched facts  With those  you can launch it straight on to the front page of the New York Times  as the story of Hillary Clinton s cash did  Like Hillary s emails it turned the news agenda  and  most crucially  it diverted the attention of the news cycle  Another classic psyops approach   Strategic drowning  of other messages   This is a strategic  long term and really quite brilliant play  In the 1990s  Bannon explained  conservative media couldn t take Bill Clinton down because  they wound up talking to themselves in an echo chamber    As  it turns out  the liberal media is now  We are scattered  separate  squabbling among ourselves and being picked off like targets in a shooting gallery  Increasingly  there s a sense that we are talking to ourselves  And whether it s Mercer s millions or other factors  Jonathan Albright s map of the news and information ecosystem shows how rightwing sites are dominating sites like YouTube and Google  bound tightly together by millions of links   Is there a central intelligence to that  I ask Albright   There has to be  There has to be some type of coordination  You can see from looking at the map  from the architecture of the system  that this is not accidental  It s clearly being led by money and politics    There s been a lot of talk in the echo chamber about Bannon in the last few months  but it s Mercer who provided the money to remake parts of the media landscape  And while Bannon understands the media  Mercer understands big data  He understands the structure of the internet  He knows how algorithms work   Robert Mercer did not respond to a request for comment for this piece  Nick Patterson  a British cryptographer  who worked at Renaissance Technologies in the 80s and is now a computational geneticist at MIT  described to me how he was the one who talent spotted Mercer   There was an elite group working at IBM in the 1980s doing speech research  speech recognition  and when I joined Renaissance I judged that the mathematics we were trying to apply to financial markets were very similar    He describes Mercer as  very  very conservative  He truly did not like the Clintons  He thought Bill Clinton was a criminal  And his basic politics  I think  was that he s a rightwing libertarian  he wants the government out of things    He suspects that Mercer is bringing the brilliant computational skills he brought to finance to bear on another very different sphere   We make mathematical models of the financial markets which are probability models  and from those we try and make predictions  What I suspect Cambridge Analytica do is that they build probability models of how people vote  And then they look at what they can do to influence that    Finding the edge is what quants do  They build quantitative models that automate the process of buying and selling shares and then they chase tiny gaps in knowledge to create huge wins  Renaissance Technologies was one of the first hedge funds to invest in AI  But what it does with it  how it s been programmed to do it  is completely unknown  It is  Bloomberg reports  the  blackest box in finance    Johan Bollen  associate professor at Indiana University School of Informatics and Computing  tells me how he discovered one possible edge  he s done research that shows you can predict stock market moves from Twitter  You can measure public sentiment and then model it   Society is driven by emotions  which it s always been difficult to measure  collectively  But there are now programmes that can read text and measure it and give us a window into those collective emotions    The research caused a huge ripple among two different constituencies   We had a lot attention from hedge funds  They are looking for signals everywhere and this is a hugely interesting signal  My impression is hedge funds do have these algorithms that are scanning social feeds  The flash crashes we ve had   sudden huge drops in stock prices   indicates these algorithms are being used at large scale  And they are engaged in something of an arms race    The other people interested in Bollen s work are those who want not only to measure public sentiment  but to change it  Bollen s research shows how it s possible  Could you reverse engineer the national  or even the global  mood  Model it  and then change it   Google  democracy and the truth about internet search Read more   It does seem possible  And it does worry me  There are quite a few pieces of research that show if you repeat something often enough  people start involuntarily to believe it  And that could be leveraged  or weaponised for propaganda  We know there are thousands of automated bots out there that are trying to do just that    THE war of the bots is one of the wilder and weirder aspects of the elections of 2016  At the Oxford Internet Institute s Unit for Computational Propaganda  its director  Phil Howard  and director of research  Sam Woolley  show me all the ways public opinion can be massaged and manipulated  But is there a smoking gun  I ask them  evidence of who is doing this   There s not a smoking gun   says Howard   There are smoking machine guns  There are multiple pieces of evidence     Look at this   he says and shows me how  before the US election  hundreds upon hundreds of websites were set up to blast out just a few links  articles that were all pro Trump   This is being done by people who understand information structure  who are bulk buying domain names and then using automation to blast out a certain message  To make Trump look like he s a consensus    And that requires money    That requires organisation and money  And if you use enough of them  of bots and people  and cleverly link them together  you are what s legitimate  You are creating truth    You can take an existing trending topic  such as fake news  and then weaponise it  You can turn it against the very media that uncovered it  Viewed in a certain light  fake news is a suicide bomb at the heart of our information system  Strapped to the live body of us   the mainstream media   One of the things that concerns Howard most is the hundreds of thousands of  sleeper  bots they ve found  Twitter accounts that have tweeted only once or twice and are now sitting quietly waiting for a trigger  some sort of crisis where they will rise up and come together to drown out all other sources of information

        "body1": "White House Chief Strategist Steve Bannon listens at right as President Donald Trump speaks during a meeting at the White House  Tuesday  Jan  31  2017    Evan Vucci   AP   It s not only not going to get better  It s going to get worse every day    When he uttered those words at the Conservative Political Action Conference  CPAC  in Washington on February 23  top Trump advisor Steve Bannon was talking about the coverage of Trump administration policies by the press  which he still insists on rather un affectionately referring to as  the opposition party    However  he may well have been describing the prospects for preserving the democratic character of American government   particularly American public administration   In a joint appearance with White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus  video   Bannon ruminated on the achievements of the Trump administration s first 30 days and waxed poetic about how  contrary to news emerging from the Washington rumor mill  he and Priebus actually get along swell   As chair of the Republican National Committee before being picked by Trump for the chief of staff role  Priebus is seen by many as one of two power centers supporting the president  He represents the establishment wing of the GOP   the party bigwigs and the Washington class  Bannon  meanwhile  as former editor of Breitbart News    platform for the alt right    is the ideological guardian of the far right nationalist and populist side of the Trump coalition   There were many points in their presentation which should arouse interest  such as Priebus  excitement that the confirmation of Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch would cement Trump policies in place for a long time to come   We re not talking about a change over a four year period  We re talking about a change of potentially 40 years of law    But it was Bannon s discussion of the key principles shaping policy development in the Trump government that were most illuminating  Describing what he called the  three buckets  of administration priorities  Bannon reinforced the focus on concepts like sovereignty  national rebirth  and authority that are key parts of the economic nationalist agenda   Perhaps his most revealing lines  however  were those concerned with something he kept referring to as the  administrative state   He said that all of Trump s cabinet appointments were  selected for a reason deconstruction of the administrative state    What exactly is the administrative state and why are ideologues like Bannon so determined to see it destroyed   The Administrative State  The term  administrative state  is a somewhat obscure one outside the circles of political science and public administration scholars  Taking advantage of this obscurity  Bannon tried to set the terms of debate and provided his own understanding of the concept    Every business leader we ve had in is saying not just taxes  but it is also the regulation  the way the progressive left runs  if they can t get it passed  they re just gonna put in some sort of regulation in in an agency  They re all going to be deconstructed and I think that s why this regulatory thing is so important    Matt Schlapp  chairman of the American Conservative Union which hosts CPAC and moderator of the Priebus Bannon talk  joined in  saying   We re promulgating more laws and regulations than we ever had before  And most of that are from these independent agencies that are just on autopilot    The image one gets of this administrative state from such explanations is of un elected left wing bureaucrats who are out of control and running roughshod over business and the American people  When Democrats can t win in elections or get something through Congress  they use their bureaucratic power to slip things in through regulation   The administrative state is presented as something subversive and anti democratic   a way in which liberals and progressives force their agenda on a public that did not vote for them   The original notion of the administrative state was actually the exact opposite   Dwight Waldo  a professor and former government price control official  first coined the term administrative state in 1948  He asserted that the orthodox notion of bureaucrats who just mindlessly follow orders from the top   a detached  supposedly  scientific  system of administration   was actually incompatible with democracy   Instead of just being cogs who carry out policy directives without thought  Waldo believed that public servants should be informed  active agents of change dedicated to improving people s lives and strengthening democratic participation   There were a few principles that were central to Waldo s notion of the administrative state  He believed the tension between democracy and bureaucracy gave those who work in government the duty to put protection of democratic principles over everything else  Openness and the participation of the people in the development and implementation of policies that affect their lives were paramount   Bureaucrats had a responsibility to serve the public  not just their political masters  In political science terminology  he rejected the notion of a politics administration dichotomy which saw the state as simply the instrument of whoever held elected power  Calls for  efficiency  by those in authority should never be allowed to override rule of law  due process  and transparency   Perhaps Waldo s most important maxim was that government cannot be run like a business  Democracy  the Constitution  and public interest require adherence to higher criteria than simply watching out for the bottom line or following orders  This implied that public servants had to think for themselves and consider the impact of what they were asked to do by policymakers  How does it affect people s lives  How should it be implemented   One of Waldo s colleagues said that due to his work  the profession of public administration  took a strong stand on humanistic administration by committing to focus on serving the public  That meant literally getting into the streets and taking an active role    The De Regulatory State  With its shock and awe campaign of rapid fire executive orders  policy guidance memoranda  and of course the directive to drop two regulations for every new one implemented  the Trump administration is so far showing a commitment to a notion of government very different than the one put forward by Waldo   Demanding adherence to presidential authority and extreme loyalty on the part of cabinet secretaries and other officials  the White House certainly appears to view the entire American government as an instrument to be wielded by the man at the top   Bureaucrats won t obey  They are shown the door  Courts won t validate decisions  Then they must be headed by  so called judges   In one short speech  Bannon sweeps them all aside as elements of a nefarious administrative state   The striving for authority and unrestricted executive power goes against the democratic and human rights sensibilities that were actually at the heart of Waldo s notion of the administrative state  War is Peace  Freedom is Slavery   In his unsophisticated attacks on the administrative state  Bannon is helped intellectually by the work of think tanks like the Heritage Foundation  which has provided the blueprints for many areas of Trump policy   They publish claims that the  growth of the administrative state can be traced  for the most part  to the New Deal  and subsequent outgrowths of the New Deal like the Great Society    In this  they are partially correct   However  while Heritage focuses on making a conservative argument for limited government  Bannon joins in the attack against the social democratic content of the New Deal and goes beyond it to push for a more executive centered state   Here  the crusade of run of the mill conservatives to roll back government and the welfare state merges with the authoritarian nationalist agenda of ideologues like Bannon   The fight against regulation and public control over things like safety conditions in the workplace  fair wages  exposure to toxins  environmental protection  or what bathroom transgender students can use   all of these get simplified and packaged up into the bogeyman called the administrative state   Demonize those who write and enforce regulations as un elected and un democratic  and you can de legitimate the things they have done in the public interest  That appears to be the goal of Bannon s pronouncements of  deconstruction    Of course few would argue that every regulation or administrative rule has a positive impact or serves the public interest  There are plenty of instances of bureaucratic failure and abuse of power  But the bigger principle of who public officials serve   the president  the people  or both   is what is actually at stake   Bannon is making the case that government exists to carry out the orders of the president that the people have elected  The essence of the administrative state ideal that he attacks is that government exists to serve the public interest   and that may not always align with the commands handed down from the White House   It s an old public administration debate that has resurfaced in the most politicized and propagandistic of terms  Bannon has stated his position  The Trump administration  he says  is  a new political order   It will be up to the American people to decide   at the ballot box eventually  and in the streets and town halls for now   which view they hold dear   CONTRIBUTOR C J  Atkins C J  Atkins is the opinion editor at People's World  He holds a Ph D  in political science from York University in Toronto and has a research and teaching background in political economy and the politics and ideas of the American left  In addition to his work at People's World  C J

Italian extremist Julius Evola is  It does not make Mr  Bannon a racist that he described Breitbart as  the platform for the alt right    a broad and imprecise term that applies to a wide array of radicals  not just certain white supremacist groups   Nor does it make Mr  Bannon a fringe character that during the meetings of the Conservative Political Action Conference in 2013 and 2014  he hosted rival panel discussions called the Uninvited   although it did show a relish for the role of ideological bad boy  Mr  Bannon s panels included such mainstream figures as the former House speaker Newt Gingrich and the former Bush administration attorney general Michael Mukasey  and discussed such familiar Republican preoccupations as military preparedness and the 2012 attacks on the United States mission in Benghazi  Libya  It wasn t much different from watching Fox News   Where Mr  Bannon does veer sharply from recent mainstream Republicanism is in his all embracing nationalism  He speaks of sovereignty  economic nationalism  opposition to globalization and finding common ground with Brexit supporters and other groups hostile to the transnational European Union  On Thursday  at this year s Conservative Political Action Conference  he described the  center core  of Trump administration philosophy as the belief that the United States is more than an economic unit in a borderless word  It is  a nation with a culture  and  a reason for being    Photo  So some of the roots of Mr  Bannon s ideology  like the roots of Mr  Trump s popularity  are to be found in the disappointed hopes of the global economy  But Mr  Bannon  unlike Mr  Trump  has a detailed idea  an explanation  of how American sovereignty was lost  and of what to do about it  It is the same idea that Tea Party activists have  A class of regulators in the government has robbed Americans of their democratic prerogatives  That class now constitutes an  administrative state  that operates to empower itself and enrich its crony capitalist allies   When Mr  Bannon spoke on Thursday of  deconstructing the administrative state   it may have sounded like gobbledygook outside the hall  but it was an electrifying profession of faith for the attendees  It is through Mr  Bannon that Trumpism can be converted from a set of nostalgic laments and complaints into a program for overhauling the government   Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Mr  Bannon adds something personal and idiosyncratic to this Tea Party mix  He has a theory of historical cycles that can be considered elegantly simple or dangerously simplistic  It is a model laid out by William Strauss and Neil Howe in two books from the 1990s  Their argument assumes an 80  to 100 year cycle divided into roughly 20 year  highs    awakenings    unravelings  and  crises   The American Revolution  the Civil War  the New Deal  World War II   Mr  Bannon has said for years that we re due for another crisis about now  His documentary about the 2008 financial collapse   Generation Zero   released in 2010  uses the Strauss Howe model to explain what happened  and concludes with Mr  Howe himself saying   History is seasonal  and winter is coming    Mr  Bannon s views reflect a transformation of conservatism over the past decade or so  You can trace this transformation in the films he has made  His 2004 documentary   In the Face of Evil   is an orthodox tribute to the Republican Party hero Ronald Reagan  But  Generation Zero   half a decade later  is a strange hybrid  The financial crash has intervened  Mr  Bannon s film features predictable interviews with think tank supply siders and free marketers fretting about big government  But new  less orthodox voices creep in  too  from the protectionist newscaster Lou Dobbs to the investment manager Barry Ritholtz  They question whether the free market is altogether free  Mr  Ritholtz says that the outcome of the financial crisis has been  socialism for the wealthy but capitalism for everybody else    By 2014  Mr  Bannon s own ideology had become centered on this distrust  He was saying such things about capitalism himself   Think about it   he said in a talk hosted by the Institute for Human Dignity   Not one criminal charge has ever been brought to any bank executive associated with 2008 crisis   He warned against  the Ayn Rand or the Objectivist School of libertarian capitalism   by which he meant  a capitalism that really looks to make people commodities  and to objectify people   Capitalism  he said  ought to rest on

was bad news for the Republican Party  By the time Mr  Bannon spoke  Ayn Rand style capitalism was all that remained of its Reagan era agenda  Free market thinking had swallowed the party whole  and its Judeo Christian preoccupations    a nation with a culture  and  a reason for being    along with it  A business orientation was what donors wanted   But voters never more than tolerated it  It was Pat Buchanan who in his 1992 run for president first called on Republicans to value jobs and communities over profits  An argument consumed the party over whether this was a better rounded vision of society or just the grousing of a reactionary  After a generation  Mr  Buchanan has won that argument  By 2016 his views on trade and migration  once dismissed as crackpot  were spreading so fast that everyone in the party had embraced them   except its elected officials and its establishment presidential candidates   Mr  Bannon does not often go into detail about what Judeo Christian culture is  but he knows one thing it is not  Islam  Like most Americans  he believes that Islamism   the extremist political movement   is a dangerous adversary  More controversially he holds that  since this political movement is generated within the sphere of Islam  the growth of Islam   the religion   is itself a problem with which American authorities should occupy themselves  This is a view that was emphatically repudiated by Presidents Obama and George W  Bush   Mr  Bannon has apparently drawn his own views on the subject from intensive  if not necessarily varied  reading  The thinkers he has engaged with in this area tend to be hot and polemical rather than cool and detached  They include the provocateur Pamela Geller  a campaigner against the  Ground Zero Mosque  who once suggested the State Department was  essentially being run by Islamic supremacists   her sometime collaborator Robert Spencer  the director of the website Jihad Watch  with whom she heads an organization called Stop Islamization of America  and the former Department of Homeland Security official Philip Haney  who has argued that officials in the Obama administration had compromised  the security of citizens for the ideological rigidity of political correctness    President Trump being unpopular among intellectuals  any thinker in his cabinet will be  at some level  a nonconformist  a rebel or an individualist  That may yet make things interesting for the country  It will certainly make Washington a hostile environment for Mr  Bannon  Many policy intellectuals in the capital have paid a steep price in swallowed misgivings and trimmed convictions to get to the place that Mr  Bannon has somehow blown into town and usurped  He never had to compromise or even modify his principles  His boss didn t even get a majority of the popular vote  Establishment conservatives may be prone to mistake their jealousy for a principled conviction that Mr  Bannon is unsocialized and dangerous   Is he  Last summer the historian Ronald Radosh contributed to this image with his  later contested  recollection that  years ago  Mr  Bannon  in the only conversation the two ever had  described himself as a  Leninist  who wanted to  bring everything crashing down    Advertisement Continue reading the main story  But Mr  Bannon s ideology  whatever it may be  does not wholly capture what drives him  says the screenwriter Julia Jones  Starting in the early 1990s  Ms  Jones and Mr  Bannon began writing screenplays together  and did so for a decade and a half  She is one of the few longtime collaborators in his otherwise peripatetic career  As Ms  Jones sees it  a more reliable key to his worldview lies in his military service   He has a respect for duty   she said in early February   The word he has used a lot is  dharma     Mr  Bannon found the concept of dharma in the Bhagavad Gita  she recalls  It can describe one s path in life or one s place in the universe   When Mr  Bannon came to Hollywood  Ms  Jones says  he was less political  For two years  according to Ms  Jones  the two of them worked on the outline of a 26 part television series about seekers after the secrets of the human self  from Arthur Conan Doyle to Nietzsche to Madame Blavatsky to Ramakrishna to the Baal Shem Tov to Geronimo   It was his idea   she said   He assembled all the people    But the Sept  11 attacks  Ms  Jones says  changed him  and their collaboration did not survive his growing engagement with politics  Speaking of his films  she says   He developed a kind of propaganda type tone of voice that I found offensive   Ms  Jones is a literary person  left liberal in politics  She regrets that Mr  Bannon  has found a home in nationalism   But she does not believe he is any kind of anarchist  let alone a racist   Those focused on Mr  Bannon s ideology are probably barking up the wrong tree  There are plenty of reasons for concern about Mr  Bannon  but they have less to do with where he stands on the issues than with who he is as a person  He is a newcomer to political power and  in fact  relatively new to an interest in politics  He is willing to break with authority  While he does not embrace any of the discredited ideologies of the last century  he is attached to a theory of history s cycles that is  to put it politely  untested  Most ominously  he is an intellectual in politics excited by grand theories   a combination that has produced unpredictable results before   We ll see how it works out  Barack Obama  in a similar way  used to allude to the direction and the  arc  of history  Some may find the two theories of history equally na ve and unrealistic  Others may see a mitigating element in the cyclical nature of Mr  Bannon s view  A progressive who believes history is more or less linear is fighting for immortality when he enters the political arena  A conservative who believes history is cyclical is fighting only for a role in managing  say  the next 20 or 80 years  Then his work will be undone  as everyone s is eventually ", 
        "body2": "Neil Howe is the author  along with William Strauss  of  Generations    The Fourth Turning  and  Millennials Rising    The headlines this month have been alarming   Steve Bannon s obsession with a dark theory of history should be worrisome   Business Insider    Steve Bannon Believes The Apocalypse Is Coming And War Is Inevitable   the Huffington Post    Steve Bannon Wants To Start World War III   the Nation   A common thread in these media reports is that President Trump s chief strategist is an avid reader and that the book that most inspires his worldview is  The Fourth Turning  An American Prophecy    I wrote that book with William Strauss back in 1997  It is true that Bannon is enthralled by it  In 2010  he released a documentary   Generation Zero   that is structured around our theory that history in America  and by extension  most other modern societies  unfolds in a recurring cycle of four generation long eras  While this cycle does include a time of civic and political crisis   a Fourth Turning  in our parlance   the reporting on the book has been absurdly apocalyptic   I don t know Bannon well  I have worked with him on several film projects  including  Generation Zero   over the years  I ve been impressed by his cultural savvy  His politics  while unusual  never struck me as offensive  I was surprised when he took over the leadership of Breitbart and promoted the views espoused on that site  Like many people  I first learned about the alt right  a far right movement with links to Breitbart and a loosely defined white nationalist agenda  from the mainstream media  Strauss  who died in 2007  and I never told Bannon what to say or think  But we did perhaps provide him with an insight   that populism  nationalism and state run authoritarianism would soon be on the rise  not just in America but around the world   Because we never attempted to write a political manifesto  we were surprised by the book s popularity among certain crusaders on both the left and the right  When  The Fourth Turning  came out  our biggest partisan fans were Democrats  who saw in our description of an emerging  Millennial generation   a term we coined  the sort of community minded optimists who would pull America toward progressive ideals  Yet we ve also had conservative fans  who were drawn to another lesson  that the new era would probably see the successful joining of left wing economics with right wing social values    The Washington Post   Beyond ideology  I think there s another reason for the rising interest in our book  We reject the deep premise of modern Western historians that social time is either linear  continuous progress or decline  or chaotic  too complex to reveal any direction   Instead we adopt the insight of nearly all traditional societies  that social time is a recurring cycle in which events become meaningful only to the extent that they are what philosopher Mircea Eliade calls  reenactments   In cyclical space  once you strip away the extraneous accidents and technology  you are left with only a limited number of social moods  which tend to recur in a fixed order   Along this cycle  we can identify four  turnings  that each last about 20 years   the length of a generation  Think of these as recurring seasons  starting with spring and ending with winter  In every turning  a new generation is born and each older generation ages into its next phase of life   The cycle begins with the First Turning  a  High  which comes after a crisis era  In a High  institutions are strong and individualism is weak  Society is confident about where it wants to go collectively  even if many feel stifled by the prevailing conformity  Many Americans alive today can recall the post World War II American High  historian William O Neill s term   coinciding with the Truman  Eisenhower and Kennedy presidencies  Earlier examples are the post Civil War Victorian High of industrial growth and stable families  and the post Constitution High of Democratic Republicanism and Era of Good Feelings   The Second Turning is an  Awakening   when institutions are attacked in the name of higher principles and deeper values  Just when society is hitting its high tide of public progress  people suddenly tire of all the social discipline and want to recapture a sense of personal authenticity  Salvation by faith  not works  is the youth rallying cry  One such era was the Consciousness Revolution of the late 1960s and 1970s  Some historians call this America s Fourth or Fifth Great Awakening  depending on whether they start the count in the 17th century with John Winthrop or the 18th century with Jonathan Edwards   The Third Turning is an  Unraveling   in many ways the opposite of the High  Institutions are weak and distrusted  while individualism is strong and flourishing  Third Turning decades such as the 1990s  the 1920s and the 1850s are notorious for their cynicism  bad manners and weak civic authority  Government typically shrinks  and speculative manias  when they occur  are delirious   Finally  the Fourth Turning is a  Crisis  period  This is when our institutional life is reconstructed from the ground up  always in response to a perceived threat to the nation s very survival  If history does not produce such an urgent threat  Fourth Turning leaders will invariably find one   and may even fabricate one   to mobilize collective action  Civic authority revives  and people and groups begin to pitch in as participants in a larger community  As these Promethean bursts of civic effort reach their resolution  Fourth Turnings refresh and redefine our national identity  The years 1945  1865 and 1794 all capped eras constituting new  founding moments  in American history   Just as a Second Turning reshapes our inner world  of values  culture and religion   a Fourth Turning reshapes our outer world  of politics  economy and empire    In our paradigm  one can look ahead and suggest that a coming time period   say  a certain decade   will resemble  in its essential human dynamic  a time period in the past  In  The Fourth Turning   we predicted that  starting around 2005  America would probably experience a  Great Devaluation  in financial markets  a catalyst that would mark America s entry into an era whose first decade would likely parallel the 1930s   Reflecting on the decade we ve just lived through  we can probably agree that the 1930s parallel works well  In the economy  both decades played out in the shadow of a global financial crash  and were characterized by slow and disappointing economic growth and chronic underemployment of labor and capital  Both saw tepid investment  deflation fears  growing inequality and the inability of central bankers to rekindle consumption   In geopolitics  we ve witnessed the rise of isolationism  nationalism and right wing populism across the globe  Geostrategist Ian Bremmer says we now live in a  G Zero  world  where it s every nation for itself  This story echoes the 1930s  which witnessed the waning authority of great power alliances and a new willingness by authoritarian regimes to act with terrifying impunity   In social trends  the two decades also show parallels  falling rates of fertility and homeownership  the rise of multi generational households  the spread of localism and community identification  a dramatic decline in youth violence  a fact that apparently has eluded the president   and a blanding of pop youth culture  Above all  we sense a growing desire among voters around the world for leaders to assert greater authority and deliver deeds rather than process  results rather than abstractions   We live in an increasingly volatile and primal era  in which history is speeding up and liberal democracy is weakening  As Vladimir Lenin wrote   In some decades  nothing happens  in some weeks  decades happen   Get ready for the creative destruction of public institutions  something every society periodically requires to clear out what is obsolete  ossified and dysfunctional   and to tilt the playing field of wealth and power away from the old and back to the young  Forests need periodic fires  rivers need periodic floods  Societies  too  That s the price we must pay for a new golden age   If we look at the broader rhythms of history  we have reason to be heartened  not discouraged  by these trends  Anglo American history over the past several centuries has experienced civic crises in a fairly regular cycle  about every 80 or 90 years  or roughly the length of a long human life  This pattern reveals itself in the intervals separating the colonial Glorious Revolution  the American Revolution  the Civil War  and the Great Depression and World War II  Fast forward the length of a long human life from the 1930s  and we end up where we are today   America entered a new Fourth Turning in 2008  It is likely to last until around 2030  Our paradigm suggests that current trends will deepen as we move toward the halfway point   Further adverse events  possibly another financial crisis or a major armed conflict  will galvanize public opinion and mobilize leaders to take more decisive action  Rising regionalism and nationalism around the world could lead to the fragmentation of major political entities  perhaps the European Union  and the outbreak of hostilities  perhaps in the South China Sea  the Korean Peninsula  the Baltic states or the Persian Gulf    Despite a new tilt toward isolationism  the United States could find itself at war  I certainly do not hope for war  I simply make a sobering observation  Every total war in U S  history has occurred during a Fourth Turning  and no Fourth Turning has yet unfolded without one  America s objectives in such a war are likely to be defined very broadly   At the end of the 2020s  the Fourth Turning crisis era will climax and draw to a close  Settlements will be negotiated  treaties will be signed  new borders will be drawn  and perhaps  as in the late 1940s  a new durable world order will be created  Perhaps as well  by the early 2030s  we will enter a new First Turning  Young families will rejoice  fertility will rebound  economic equality will rise  a new middle class will emerge  public investment will grow into a new 21st century infrastructure  and ordered prosperity will recommence   During the next First Turning  potentially the next  American High   millennials will move into national leadership and showcase their optimism  smarts  credentials and confidence  Sometime in the late 2030s  the first millennial will be voted into the White House  prompting talk of a new Camelot moment  Let a few more years pass  and those organization minded millennials may face a passionate and utterly unexpected onslaught from a new crop of youth   Welcome to the next Awakening  The cycle of history keeps turning  inexorably   Neil Howe is the author  along with William Strauss  of  Generations    The Fourth Turning  and  Millennials Rising  ",
