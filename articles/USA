Our commandos are chasing them,\u201d Ministry spokesman Dawlat Waziri told AFP four hours after the first explosion.\n\n\u201cOne of them has been killed, but two others are still resisting on the sixth and seventh floors of the building. We have evacuated all the patients.\u201d\n\n\u2018Criminal act\u2019\n\nAfghanistan's warring parties, including government forces, have repeatedly targeted medical facilities, decimating the country's fragile health system and preventing conflict displaced civilians from accessing life saving care.\n\n\u201cThis is a criminal act. Nothing can justify an attack on hospitals,\u201d Afghan Chief Executive Abdullah Abdullah said of the latest attack.\n\n\u201cWe will never forgive these criminals. Unfortunately, this attack has resulted in some casualties.\u201d\n\nIslamic State jihadists claimed the attack via a verified Telegram account.\n\nThe Taliban said they could neither confirm nor deny that they were behind the attack. The militant group, Afghanistan's largest, is known to distance itself from attacks on medical facilities or those that result in high civilian casualties.\n\nThe assault comes just a week after 16 people were killed in simultaneous Taliban suicide assaults on two security compounds in Kabul.\n\nDozens of others were wounded as a suicide car bomber struck an Afghan police precinct in western Kabul and a five-hour gun battle ensued after another attacker snuck in.\n\nIn the second attack, a suicide bomber blew himself up at the gates of an Afghan intelligence agency branch in eastern Kabul.\n\nThe growing violence underscores rising insecurity in Afghanistan over the resurgent Taliban.\n\nThe country is bracing for an intense fighting season in the spring as the government's repeated bids to launch peace negotiations with the Taliban have failed.\n\nAfghan forces, already beset by record casualties, desertions and non-existent \u201cghost soldiers\u201d on the payrolls, have been struggling to beat back the Taliban since US-led NATO troops ended their combat mission in December 2014.\n\nKabul last month endorsed U.S. general John Nicholson's call for thousands of additional coalition troops in Afghanistan to fend off the militants before the spring offensive.\n\nExtra troops were needed to end the stalemate in the war, Gen. Nicholson, top U.S. commander in Afghanistan, told the U.S. Congress in what could be President Donald Trump's first major test of military strategy.",

They killed the attackers around 3:30 p.m. local time (6 a.m. Wednesday ET).\n\nThe facility, known locally as the \"400 bed\" hospital, is located only a few hundred meters from the US embassy and the diplomatic quarter of Kabul. Other recent attacks in Kabul have targeted important public buildings, such as the Afghan Supreme Court and national parliament.\n\nA Taliban spokesman, Zabiullah Mojahid, denied responsibility for the attack in a tweet, saying: \"Today's attack on hospital in Kabul has nothing to do with the Mujahidin of Islamic Emirate,\" using the group's formal name.\n\nIn the vacuum of a Taliban claim, the ISIS-affiliated news agency Amaq said ISIS claimed responsibility for the attack. Although the group usually attacks sectarian targets, it is credible that it planned and carried out the attack. CNN has not independently verified the claim.\n\nExplosions, then gunfire\n\nWitnesses told CNN an explosion was first heard around at 9 a.m. local time (11.30 p.m. Tuesday ET).\n\nAfghan National Police special forces rushed in to counter the attack.\n\n\"At first there was a firing followed by a huge blast,\" an employee at a nearby hospital said.\n\nAn employee at an Italian restaurant nearby said she heard one explosion around 9 a.m., then heard gunfire about 25 minutes later.\n\nThe attackers were not immediately killed because security forces were busy evacuating patients, the defense ministry statement said.\n\nThe injured were taken to the Wazir Akbar Khan hospital, said Smael Kawosi, media relation officer for the Ministry of Health.\n\nAttack condemned\n\nAfghan Chief Executive Abdullah Abdullah condemned the attack.\n\n\"I condemn the terrorist attacked on hospital in Kabul,\" he tweeted. \"While we work for peace, we'll avenge the blood of our people.\"\n\nThe US Embassy in Kabul said, \"Targeting a medical facility providing care for the brave Afghans working to protect their fellow citizens has no possible justification in any religion or creed.\"\n\nNATO forces in Afghanistan indicated that the organization was standing by to assist Afghan security forces, according to tweets from Operation Resolute Support.\n\n\"Once again insurgents show complete disrespect for humanity by attacking a hospital. We stand with Afghan people against terrorism.\"\n\nThe NATO tweets condemned the attack, using an older name for the hospital.\n\nSoft targets\n\nMilitants have long targeted loosely guarded targets in Kabul and across Afghanistan. Last month, at least 20 people died after a suicide blast outside Afghanistan's Supreme Court in Kabul, police and other officials told CNN.\n\nA suicide bomber detonated his explosives in a parking lot near the court in the Afghan capital, according to Basir Mojahid, spokesman for Kabul's chief of police.\n\nEarlier in the year, a spate of attacks -- two suicide bombings near the Afghan Parliament in Kabul, an explosion at a Kandahar province government compound and a suicide bombing in Helmand province -- left dozens of people dead and wounded.\n\nThe Taliban claimed responsibility for the Kabul attacks, which killed at least 36 people and injured 76 others in the capital.\n\nLast summer, seven students, three police officers and two security guards were killed in the attack on the American University of Afghanistan campus in the capital.\n\nPolice searched the university's grounds and killed two attackers who stormed the campus with guns and explosives, Fraidoon Obaidi, chief of Kabul police's criminal investigation department, said. The gunmen detonated explosives and fired guns, witnesses said, causing some students and faculty to flee.",

(AP)\n\nFor more than an hour Tuesday night, a cloak of darkness covered Lady Liberty. Some of the lights that normally illuminate the statue went off before 11 p.m., leaving only her still-lit torch and crown visible to most in New York Harbor.\n\nAs one Twitter post opined, the timing was \u201cjust too perfect.\u201d Definitely, tweeted another, \u201can ominous sign of the times.\u201d\n\nThe near-blackout of the universal symbol of freedom was invested with great meaning on the Internet, with a consensus settling, more or less, on two interpretations.\n\nLady Liberty was either protesting President Trump generally and, more specifically, his travel ban just a day after he signed the revised executive order limiting entry to the United States from six Muslim-majority countries.\n\nOr she was signaling her solidarity with #DayWithoutWoman, a strike scheduled for Wednesday that asks women to skip work to show the world what life would be like without them.\n\n\u201cGive me your tired your poor your huddled masses but later. We\u2019re closed,\u201d one tweet said. Her lights were out because \u201cTrump has plunged our country into darkness,\u201d said another.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been wondering how long before France asks @realDonaldTrump for the statue of liberty back as he clearly doesn\u2019t respect its symbolism,\u201d tweeted Jason Rumble.\n\nPerhaps when her lights came back on, her forearm would display a \u201cNevertheless, she persisted,\u201d tattoo, another tweet suggested. Could it be that Lady Liberty \u2014 one of the nation\u2019s most recognizable female figures \u2014 was participating in the \u201cDay Without a Woman?\u201d\n\nIndeed, Women\u2019s March, organizers of \u201cA Day Without a Woman,\u201d were quick to thank the statue for \u201cstanding with the resistance and going dark\u201d for the event.\n\n\u201cLady Liberty got the memo,\u201d the organizers added in a tweet. \u201cThat\u2019s ONE MORE woman America CANNOT do without,\u201d another Twitter user wrote.\n\nOn the other hand, someone else suggested, perhaps Russian hackers were to blame.\n\nThank you Lady Liberty for standing with the resistance and going dark for #DayWithoutAWoman \ud83d\uddfd \ud83d\udcf7: @randybals #StatueOfLiberty pic.twitter.com/D0JG9MmSRj \u2014 Women's March (@womensmarch) March 8, 2017\n\nThe lights are out at the Statue of Liberty\u2026that's ONE MORE woman America CANNOT do without. #adaywithoutwomen #LightsOut \u2014 Girls Really Rule. (@girlsreallyrule) March 8, 2017\n\nUltimately, the lights came back on at about midnight and the National Park Service, ever the spoiler, explained what might have happened, stressing that crews had not yet inspected the scene to establish a definitive cause.\n\nThe park staff suspected the outage was related to ongoing work on a new emergency backup generator for Liberty Island, according to Jerry Willis, a public affairs officer for the NPS. To activate the generator \u2014 a replacement for a generator damaged in Hurricane Sandy in 2012 \u2014 park staff had prepared for a lighting outage later in the week, Willis told The Washington Post.\n\nWillis suspected that a setting on the timer for the lighting system was changed, moving up the outage.\n\nWillis insisted it was \u201cnot in any way\u201d related to the \u201cDay Without a Woman.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t use the lighting system to back any particular cause,\u201d he said.\n\nEven after the truth came out, the timely quips continued. Comedian Aparna Nancherla tweeted: \u201cApparently the Statue of Liberty lights went out due to a power failure. But I would argue women are also protesting due to a power failure.\u201d\n\nApparently the Statue of Liberty lights went out due to a power failure. But I would argue women are also protesting due to a power failure. \u2014 Aparna Nancherla (@aparnapkin) March 8, 2017\n\nLady Liberty\u2019s lights last went off for a prolonged period during Hurricane Sandy, when about 75 percent of the island\u2019s 12 acres was underwater, causing serious damage that would keep the island closed for eight months for repairs. Although the statue was unscathed, its lights turned off when the island lost electricity. It was later illuminated by temporary floodlights powered by a generator.\n\nIn July 2015, a new light-emitting diode (LED) light system was installed to do the job.\n\n\u201cWe know how important it is that she stays lit, so we do our very best to keep it that way,\u201d Willis said.\n\nHe said that given recent news, the symbol of Lady Liberty has been used \u201cquite a bit as of late\u201d and is \u201cat the forefront of a lot of what\u2019s going on in the world.\u201d\n\nLast month, activists unfurled a banner with the words \u201cRefugees Welcome\u201d on the statue\u2019s observation deck after the Department of Homeland Security began implementing Trump\u2019s crackdown on illegal immigration. The sign was removed more than an hour later.\n\nThe New Yorker\u2019s anniversary issue last month featured \u201cLiberty\u2019s Flameout,\u201d a cover image of Lady Liberty lifting up an extinguished torch, in response to the opening weeks of the Trump administration.\n\n\u201cIt used to be that the Statue of Liberty, and her shining torch, was the vision that welcomed new immigrants. And, at the same time, it was the symbol of American values,\u201d said the artist, John W.

Let us applaud Indira Gandhi, Amelia Earhart, Maya Angelou, Malala Yousafzai, and all the other big names we can remember. We will send sweet messages to our girlfriends, sisters, wives, daughters, mothers, etc., wishing them all a Happy Women's Day.\n\nToday is their day, after all.\n\nTomorrow, we can beat them black and blue again.\n\nTomorrow, when it's no longer Women's Day, we can deny women equal pay. We can go back to the routine of harassing women for their choice of clothes, and threatening them with rape and acid attacks for expressing their opinions.\n\n#FYI: Chinmayi Sripaada threatened with rape, acid attack on Twitter; her online petition demanding action goes viral\n\nToday, since it's the grand International Women's Day, let us put our 'feminist' sashes on and celebrate womanhood.\n\nMotherhood is great too. We won't stop gabbing about it today. We will raise our glasses to the Eves who have been ripping their bodies apart since the beginning of time to keep the human race alive (did that sound flowery enough?).\n\nBut, heaven forbid, if we learn to deal with a movie cheering to women's sexuality like grown-ups...(rest has been censored, apologies.)\n\nWe will never get tired of debating over a woman's right to wear or take off her hijab, but Lipstick Under My Burkha is a big shame-shame. We will put a ban on it and that will not even be up for discussion. No means no, right?\n\nSo, cheers to Women's Day! We believe you can fly, but we cannot accept the reality that you too have wet dreams and fantasies. That you too, like men, can like sex, and that is normal.\n\n#FYI: How a daily wager's daughter from a conservative Muslim family made it to medical college\n\nWe will tell our women today how blessed we are to have them in our lives. And then, we will put them in crates to protect them from their own \"hormonal outbursts\".\n\nAfter all, that is how women's safety works. We put a seven-o-clock curfew on hostels to protect our girls, because no rape happens before that, right? And girls do not crave sex, or - as they say - have \"hormonal outbursts\" in daylight. Of course.\n\nWomen's day...what a wonderful day it is!\n\nIt comes less than a month after Valentine's Day, the day of love. The day we bring out our sticks and stones to hound unmarried couples, whether or not they are even celebrating Valentine's Day.\n\nThis year's Women's Day comes days after a college principal in Kerala (a lady principal, mind you) imposed a rule on her female students that prohibits them from closing their doors when they change clothes.\n\nWhy? Because Madam Principal fears that her students will turn lesbians and have sex with each other if they change clothes behind locked doors.\n\nLet us give a warm Women's Day shout-out to this amazing teacher. More power to you, ma'am! Women like you help patriarchy stay alive.\n\n#FYI: Kerala Muslim fanatic wants acid poured on woman's face if 'she barks against Islam'\n\nToday, we are in love with women; a tad bit more than usual. But feminism is still the dirtier F-word.\n\nIf you are a woman who calls herself a feminist, we will slam you. We have invented a new word for people like you who talk too much: 'feminazi'.\n\nYes, we equate you to those who cheered the Holocaust.\n\nAnd if you are a man who calls himself a feminist, we are going to laugh at your face. That, or we will applaud you for being the 'real' man. You will try to make us understand that you're just a guy who believes in equality, that it is normal. But we won't get it, no matter how hard you try.\n\nBecause we just don't understand feminism. The simple concept that men, women and people of all other genders are equal and deserve the same rights? Wow, that is more befuddling than rocket science!\n\nWhat we understand, however, is the urge to follow trends and show-off.\n\nSince it is Women's Day, we will cheer 'Girl Power'. We will solemnly swear to support women's rights, fight against gender-biased violence, and eradicate practices like trafficking, female foeticide, flesh trade, etc. (like that isn't feminism).\n\nHowever, will also draw a line. Because our women, after all, should be sanskaari.\n\n#FYI: 'Kerala priest raped, because temptations,' church-backed magazine resorts to victim blaming\n\nSo, go ahead, dear women, enjoy the privileges that the patriarchal society you live in so benevolently allows you.\n\nYou have the right to vote (a right you had to fight it out to get, while most men got it naturally), but you don't quite have the right to decide what you want to do with your own body. You have the right to education, but think again if you believe it comes easy.\n\nYou can step out of the house and have a career. But mind you, you'll be judged every step of the way. Choose your career over having a family, and we will call you less of a woman. Choose to be a homemaker, and we will shake our heads at the opportunity you wasted.\n\nYou have the freedom of choice. Well, some what. Because no matter what you choose, you will be expected to be the jack of all trades. You will be expected to excel at your job and master at raising a family at the same time. You are a woman, after all. You have to be a superhero, you want to or not.\n\nYou also have to be equally modern and traditional, by the way, because that is what makes you a complete woman. Put your foot down and be whoever you want to be, and we will judge you, and hold you responsible if you are harmed.\n\nYou live in an age where women have come a long way. You have so much more freedom than your mothers and grandmothers did. Hush now, don't argue otherwise. Women shouldn't raise their voices. So un-ladylike!\n\nWhat now? What about the violence, the discrimination you still face based on your gender, you say?\n\nWell...don't wear small clothes, and don't go out at night. And don't mingle with men who are outside your family. That is what we will tell you. Because with our thick heads, we cannot accept the fact that none of these things stop a pervert, or matter to a raging sexist.\n\nToday, we will remind you that you are special.

But the top comment, with nearly 1,000 \u201clikes,\u201d asked why men should be celebrated on International Women\u2019s Day.\n\n\u201cI am puzzled. There are so many things that can be done to celebrate women, and yet the call goes out to celebrating men. Allies and unity are crucial, but so is womanhood,\u201d wrote a Facebook user named Bibi Ebel.\n\nBelow that, the second-top comment with more than 400 \u201clikes\u201d was equally critical.\n\n\u201cUgh, really?!?! Don't we already celebrate men enough?? Do we really need to make International WOMENS Day about the men in our lives??? This seems to really miss the whole point,\u201d wrote a user named Kristina Kurth Benoit.\n\nTwitter user Robin Mazumder weighed in, saying as a \u201cmale ally, the last thing I would want to do is receive recognition and take up space on any day, let alone #IWD2017.\u201d\n\nAs a male ally, the last thing I would want to do is receive recognition and take up space on any day, let alone #IWD2017. #tomorrowinhand \u2014 Robin Mazumder (@RobinMazumder) March 7, 2017\n\nOyster wife tweeted: \u201cBecause what we really need to do on international women\u2019s day is pay more attention to men.\"\n\n#tomorrowinhand because what we really need to do on international women's day is pay more attention to men \u2014 oyster wife (@adultcola_) March 7, 2017\n\nThe backlash continued on Twitter, where Conservative MP Michelle Rempel said she\u2019s \u201cnever had to have my hand held.\u201d\n\nI've never had to have my hand held. #equalitymatters pic.twitter.com/z46NCZcZ4Z \u2014 Michelle Rempel (@MichelleRempel) March 7, 2017\n\nBut back on the original Facebook post, where \u201clikes\u201d outweighed the negative comments, others defended Gregoire Trudeau.\n\n\u201cIt was just a comment to include not divide for heavens sake,\u201d wrote one supporter. \u201cThe negativity this post has brought out does not even make sense.\u201d\n\nOthers simply took up Gregoire Trudeau\u2019s call, posting social media images featuring their male partners.\n\nOne Instagram user wrote that it\u2019s \u201ctime to take a stand and to help women who are unable to help themselves, also take the time to thank the important male figures in your (life) who appreciate you and treat you with the respect you deserve.\u201d\n\n\n\nTomorrow is international women's day, with that being said take a picture with a male who is important in your life and #tomorrowinhand , Grateful to live in such an amazing country that acknowledges the importance of gender equality and also the important role that women play in society, I get to wake up every morning and attend school,drive, things that I take for granted many women often don't attend school or have the ability to drive things that we take for granted, many women are often considered less then human simply because they are female, it's time to take a stand and to help women who are unable to help themselves, also take the time to thank the important male figures in your who appreciate you and treat you with the respect you deserve, we have come so far but there is still plenty of work to be done and together we can get there #genderequality #becauseiamagirl #bestrong #internationalwomensday #proudtobecanadian #menandwomenequal #breakstigmas #voiceforthevoiceless #voiceforchange #standup A post shared by Chelsea Court (@chelseeacourt) on Mar 7, 2017 at 7:44am PST\n\nOh @sophiegregoiretrudeau I can deny you nothing! #TomorrowInHand #equalitymatters A post shared by Laurie Gardner (@lauriekgardner) on Mar 7, 2017 at 12:55pm PST\n\nGregoire Trudeau responded to the controversy in a follow-up post Tuesday night -- and stayed positive.\n\n\u201cWell, now we\u2019re having a conversation!

I\u2019m surprised that it\u2019s so bad. And it is laughably bad.'\n\nMarvel's Iron Fist - Trailer\n\nUproxx:\n\n'If Iron Fist was an otherwise boring series with a hero who kicked butt in exciting ways early and often, I\u2019d forgive the bland expository parts in the same way I do for a lot of action shows and movies. And if Finn Jones couldn\u2019t fight but was otherwise a riveting screen presence blessed with sparkling dialogue and a compelling character arc, I\u2019d get past the alleged living weapon\u2019s lame physical prowess. But when neither part works at all, why would anyone but the most devout, masochistic Marvel completist want to watch?'\n\nThe Hollywood Reporter:\n\n'Through six episodes, in addition to failing to introduce a main character I care about at all, Iron Fist hasn't given me any season-long arc/objective that I could describe for you, much less one I'm curious to see resolved.'\n\nThe Verge:\n\n'Fans feared the worst when the series was announced, and all their fears came true.'\n\nLook out for our review of the first episode shortly.",

        "body2": "Brett Chan is a lifelong martial artist and the Stunt and Fight Coordinator for IRON FIST and MARCO POLO as well. He has an extensive resume of film credentials including RESIDENT EVIL 5: RETRIBUTION, UNDERWORLD 3: RISE OF THE LYCANS, CABIN IN THE WOODS, NACHO LIBRE, and HOT ROD, to name only a select few. He is also the president of Hitz International, an international stunt team with several of his crew working on films like GHOST IN THE SHELL, THOR, AQUAMAN, HACKSAW RIDGE and POWER RANGERS.\n\nComicsVerse: What originally got you into stunt work?\n\nBrett Chan: I was always a big fan of action, as I was a martial artist since I was 5 years old. I actually never thought I could get into it and was going to school for my Pre-Meds. [Then] I started to date a girl who owned her own casting agency and she asked me if I wanted to be in it. I got a commercial called \u201cKarate Fighters\u201d and I later met guys who were on NINJA TURTLES the TV series and I auditioned for it and I got on it, then it just kept rolling and I loved it and kept up with it.\n\nCV: Where did you first begin your martial arts training? What did you learn?\n\nBC: I was 5 years old and I was in the Philippines Baguio. My father had me put in Kung Fu and also Shotokan Karate, that started a long journey of different martial arts till this day, 40 years later.\n\nREAD: We interview Andrew MacLean of HEAD LOPPER!\n\nCV: What has the transition back and forth from the martial arts to stunt work to coordinator and director been like for you? Has it been difficult and what are the challenges?\n\nBC: Well, as a martial artist you never stop [learning] as you go along your career. You always continue your journey with martial arts, as you never stop learning. Once you get into stunt work, which you usually get into with a skill you are proficient with, then you need to branch off and learn new things. This transition is easy if you meet like minded people and have different skill sets and you can cross-train each other. The business is pretty cutthroat, especially if you are minority ethnicity as the jobs are MUCH fewer. Now, as you transition to stunt coordinator, it is THAT MUCH MORE DIFFICULT, as there are even fewer jobs but you realize and find out pretty quickly who is your friend and who supports you and a lot of the time, getting to stunt coordinator and being successful, is also [due to] the people you surround yourself with. The progression to 2nd unit directing/action directing was a real honor. Those opportunities come up even less, as there are all sorts of different cogs in the wheel that have to be in sync for it to happen and for someone to believe in you to do it, as it is a crucial part of making the action look good. There are lots of well-qualified people. It's all about getting your work to be seen so that someone gives you the opportunity to do it.\n\nCV: Iron Fist is a martial arts based character and everything about Iron Fist revolves around it. How much involvement did you have in the 13 episode series?\n\nBC: I was the 2nd unit director, stunt coordinator and fight coordinator. I had full involvement in all the episodes, it is one of those shows that they hired me for my vision and [to be] hands on. I had a fabulous team and I know I could let go sometimes and let them evolve, allowing me to do other things, then [get] back to it. We would overlap episodes so after meetings and choreographing, I would have to go [back] to set again and again. I had to be able to trust my team to keep my vision going.\n\nREAD: The ComicsVerse interview you never knew you needed!\n\nCV: How closely did you work with Finn Jones?\n\nBC: In the beginning of the show and prep, I was hands-on with Finn with choreography and [the] start of his training, my assistant fight choreographer and assistant stunt coordinator would help manage that.\n\nCV: What style of martial arts influenced Finn\u2019s portrayal of Iron Fist? Was it Kung Fu? If so, what style? Was it a hybrid or different martial arts?\n\nBC: The showrunner Scott Buck and his guys all gave me an idea of what they wanted to see. We were going with Wing Chun and also influenced by all the animal styles of Kung Fu. He does a lot of Dragon, Crane, Tiger and some Snake and Monkey.\n\nCV: How hands-on was your work in the series? How much creative control did you have?\n\nBC: Scott Buck (the show runner) and [the] directors and Marvel executives always listened to my input and sometimes went with my ideas and with action, with 2nd unit directing, it was dependent on the director. Certain episodes I had a lot of creative [input] and others I wouldn\u2019t.\n\nCV: How much stunt work was done by wire/CGI versus no stunt double or \u201cno wires\u201d?\n\nBC: Our stunt double for Iron Fist was not a Kung Fu guy but [he] was a martial artist. So he extensively trained with us to get his Kung Fu game on. There was minimal wire work and minimal CGI with the fights, our Colleen Wing character Jessica Henwick was the real deal. She trained 6 hours a day with us regardless if she was filming that day or not, as were our other characters which I am not sure if I can name at the moment.\n\nCV: Was there any type of homage to certain Hong Kong or martial arts directors or specific choreography? Like the Shaw Brothers, Jackie Chan, Stephen Chow or Bruce Lee?\n\nBC: This all came from different aspects of [the] influences [of] all the above, as it has formed me and my ideas! Yuen Woo Ping is also a name you missed. The higher ups all asked that it not be floaty or wire-like and more grounded but, trying to keep the style.\n\nREAD: CV brings you a BLOODSHOT SALVATION preview!\n\nCV: Who has been the biggest influence in your career?\n\nBC: My father, for always pushing me to excel in martial arts and in my career Nick Powell (now a Director, former 2nd unit director/stunt coordinator/fight coordinator).\n\nCV: You have an extremely long list of film credentials and work in different films, what is your ultimate goal or dream in your career?\n\nBC: Right now, 2nd unit directing and stunt coordinating. I really love the creative process of the script, the story and eventually, [I'd like to] direct and produce creatively.\n\nCV: What can fans expect from IRON FIST as far as action and the fight scenes? Are any your favorite or stand out in particular?\n\nBC: Well, we didn\u2019t want to make it just all action, [it] needs story and character to drive it. So with the action that we have put out, I hope that the edits come out as action packed with style, that will leave the audience wanting more and more.\n\nREAD: When does realism in comics and TV become a problem?\n\nCV: If you had to give advice to someone who is looking to make a career in stunt work or the stunt coordination and fight choreography field, what would it be?\n\nBC: Be the best at your craft, persevere and be true to yourself.\n\nIRON FIST launches Friday, March 17th on Netflix.\n\nYou can find more from Brett Chan at his websites hitzinternational.com and brettchanstunts.com!",

        "body2": "Billionaire David Tepper, a prominent hedge fund manager who publicly criticized Donald Trump on the eve of the presidential election, said on Wednesday that the U.S. economy would benefit from the absence of new regulations coming out of a Trump and Republican-controlled Washington.\n\n\u201cThe day we had three Republican houses, the president and two houses, that was the day there wasn\u2019t going to be another regulation put on the economy and that alone releases animial spirits,\u201d Tepper said in a CNBC interview on Wednesday. \u201cIf nothing else happens that releases animal spirits.\u201d\n\nPresident Trump has made the deregulation of American business a priority and has even signed an executive action aimed at reducing regulation by directing federal agencies to establish task forces to search and destroy regulations.\n\nTepper, who runs $17 billion hedge fund Appaloosa Management, pointed out that regulations in the U.S. have been increasing for 16 years under President George W. Bush and President Barack Obama, but now American businesses have assurances that no new regulations are coming and tax cuts are potentially on their way.\n\nWith the U.S. stock market up 12% since Trump was elected, Tepper conceded that U.S. stocks were not cheap, but he also emphasized that central banks around the world are still applying easy monetary policy and every region of the world was growing economically, from the U.S. to Europe, Japan and China. There is \u201csynchronized growth around the world, which is pretty unusual the last ten years,\u201d Tepper said. \u201cCan\u2019t be short in that kind of set up, I am not suggesting the market is cheap.\u201d\n\nTepper said on Wednesday that he is shorting bonds and buying European stocks. He is betting on the U.S. economy strengthening and interest rates rising around the world. Asked if he was shorting bonds, Tepper said, \u201cyou bet your heine.\u201d\n\nWith the potential of Trump and Washington implementing tax cuts and inflation picking up, Tepper said the Federal Reserve \u201chas to get really nervous at some point,\u201d and that the U.S. central bank would raise rates more quickly if there is fiscal stimulus. \u201cBonds are really hard to own,\u201d Tepper said.\n\nThe upcoming event that Tepper is watching most closely is the election in France. He thinks concerns fueled by Trump\u2019s election in the U.S. and the Brexit vote in the U.K. that nationalist presidential candidate Marie La Pen would win were overdone. Tepper pointed out that the polls show La Pen losing in the second round and that the other two favorite candidates, Fran\u00e7ois Fillon and Emmanuel Macron, are more pro-business than current French President Francois Hollande. \u201cI am long European equities,\u201d Tepper said. \u201cThere is the upside that people aren\u2019t recognizing.\u201d",

        "body1": "The rumors aren't new. The first reports came out more than a month ago. Yet, momentum continues to build around a trade sending Kirk Cousins to the 49ers.\n\nThe NFL's legal tampering period opened Tuesday at noon, and little actual news broke on the unofficial start to 2017 free agency. In a way, something has to fill that void, and that something is Cousins trade rumors.\n\nUnfortunately for Redskins fans that want to keep their quarterback, the increased talk surrounding Cousins leaving Washington is not something to be easily dismissed. In fact, it's the opposite, and there is mounting evidence why.\n\nIn 2016, the 'Skins placed the non-exclusive franchise tag on Cousins, and the quarterback moved quick to sign the offer.\n\nIn 2017, the 'Skins placed the exclusive franchise tag on Cousins, and more than a week has passed without a signature on the tender.\n\nThe delay in signing the offer creates some natural questions around Cousins' desire to stay in Burgundy and Gold. On top of that, reports showed that the Redskins offered Cousins a long-term deal worth $100 million. Not the peak of the market Cousins can likely earn, but still a legit offer. The Cousins camp turned that down.\n\nAt this point, it seems possible Cousins might want out of D.C. It's also almost a certainty Cousins wants to maximize his value before signing any multi-year deal.\n\nAdditionally, there is the situation at Redskins Park. General manager Scot McCloughan did not travel with the Redskins front office to the NFL Scouting Combine last week. On Tuesday, McCloughan was not with the team in their Ashburn offices. Whatever the reason for McCloughan's absence, it adds uncertainty to the equation.\n\nThat uncertainty, combined with Cousins not signing his $24 million franchise tender yet and a lull in contract talks, breeds speculation.\n\nAnd then there is San Francisco. Kyle Shanahan knows Cousins can run his offense, and is in a position to go for what he wants with the Niners.\n\nReally no sense in giving Shanahan a 6-year deal and then deciding NOT to go after the QB he wants. \u2014 Tim Kawakami (@timkawakami) March 8, 2017\n\nThe Redskins are also in a tight spot with Cousins. If a long-term deal can't be reached, does Washington want to let their quarterback play again on a one-year deal and risk losing him with no compensation next season? To get compensation, the team likely needs to act quick, certainly before the draft.\n\nPlenty of league sources seem convinced that Cousins is on his way out, either this offseason or a year from now.\n\nThe more people I talk to about Kirk Cousins the more I'm convinced that there is ZERO chance he's with the Redskins past this season. \u2014 Dan Hellie (@DanHellie) March 8, 2017\n\nCharley Casserly knows the Redskins well. He worked in the team's front office for more than a decade, earning three Super Bowl rings and serving as GM of the 1991 world champs. He also knows the NFL well. He's worked with the league as an advisor for years, ran the Houston Texans for a time, and is well plugged in.\n\nCasserly released a mock draft on Tuesday, and sure enough, he had the Redskins picking No. 2 overall. Currently, San Francisco has the second pick. That means Casserly sees a trade happening too.\n\nThe noise is growing. That doesn't always mean a move will happen, especially this early in the offseason, but it's getting harder and harder to ignore.\n\n<<<LOOKING AT REDSKINS DRAFT PROSPECTS>>>\n\nWant more Redskins?

Additionally, his catch percentage of 74.6 represented the highest mark of his career by more than four percentage points.\n\n\"I feel like the older I get, the better I get,\" Davis said in December, according to Stephen Whyno of the Associated Press. \"I feel like I'm just starting, man. I'm just getting started. I tell everyone the same thing: When I lose my speed, then I'll hang it up. But I still have my speed. I can still run. With that, I continue to play this game.\"\n\nDavis served as the ideal safety blanket alongside the injury-prone Jordan Reed, and his ability to seamlessly vacillate between different roles gave quarterback Kirk Cousins some much-needed peace of mind throughout the 2016 season.\n\n\"It's just been a joy to play with him and have him on the team,\" Cousins said, per Whyno. \"And with the injuries that Jordan's sustained, he's become even more valuable needing to step up and be a difference maker.\"\n\nWhile Davis' days of piling up gaudy stats appear to be over, his smooth route running, solid in-line blocking and strong hands should help him remain a staple of Washington's offense as the Redskins retool following the departure of offensive coordinator Sean McVay.",

But in a #RedskinsTalk podcast discussion with CSN Insider JP Finlay, Vernon Davis sounded like he had no such doubts.\n\n\"Jay Gruden is probably one of my favorite coaches, all-time,\" Davis told Finlay. \"And I say that because of his personality, his enthusiasm, his approach to the game. He's just a terrific coach. Everyone respects him, they look to him as a leader. He's just everything you could possibly want in a coach.\"\n\nDavis didn't just stop there, though. He went as far to say that Gruden is a reason why staying in the Burgundy and Gold is such an attractive option for the free agent tight end.\n\n\"I love him, I love him, and that's one of the other reasons that I wouldn't mind staying here,\" he said. \"He allows the players to play really, really loose, and you want that in a coach.\"\n\n\u200bMORE REDSKINS: ALFRED MORRIS IS REPORTEDLY ON THE TRADING BLOCK\n\nAside from the way Gruden carries himself, it's obvious that Davis can fit in the coach's system. Last season showed that he, even as a No. 2 tight end behind Jordan Reed, can put up impressive numbers and be a featured weapon instead of an afterthought like he had been in previous years.\n\nAdd those things up, plus the fact that the 33-year-old is from the area, and he made it clear to Finlay that signing back with the Redskins is something he'd be very interested in doing.\n\n\"You know I'm letting my agent deal with that at the moment with hopes that I'll be back with the Washington Redskins,\" he answered when asked about free agency. \"I'll just be optimistic about it. I would love to stay here because it's such a great organization. The locker room's amazing. I'm extremely happy here, and it would only make sense to stay here and continue to be a Washington Redskin.\"\n\nWant more Redskins?

Like that game, it\u2019s set in the Lord of the Rings universe as inspired by Peter Jackson\u2019s films, and will once again see you tasked with thinning the ranks of Sauron\u2019s forces.\n\nRead next: Best upcoming games\n\nShadow of War was revealed in February 2017 with a cinematic announcement trailer that shows off the game\u2019s world and story, though doesn\u2019t reveal much gameplay. Still, this is where you\u2019ll find everything we know so far about Shadow of War\u2019s release date, price, platforms, and gameplay, and we\u2019ll keep updating it as we find out more.\n\nWhen is the Shadow of War release date?\n\nMiddle-earth: Shadow of War is coming out in the UK and worldwide on 25 August 2017 for PS4, Xbox One, and PC. The game will also be part of the Play Anywhere scheme, which means if you buy a digital copy from Microsoft you can play it on either Xbox One or PC, with your save data transferring between them.\n\nRead next: Best Xbox One games\n\nThere will also be an enhanced version released with Xbox One Scorpio support, but naturally that won\u2019t come out until the console does some time later in the year.\n\nHow much will Shadow of War cost in the UK? How to pre-order Shadow of War\n\nPre-orders are now open for Shadow of War, and predictably it\u2019s available in a whole slew of different versions.\n\nYou can pre-order the standard version of Shadow of War from Amazon or Game for \u00a349.99, or $59.99 from Amazon US, which will get you the base game and \u201cfour legendary Orc champions & exclusive Sword of Dominion,\u201d as a pre-order bonus.\n\nAlso see: Best games deals\n\nZavvi has the \u00a369.99 Silver Edition ($79.99 from Best Buy in the US), which includes the Slaughter Tribe and Outlaw Tribe Nemesis expansions and a Silver War Chest.\n\nThe next tier up is the Gold Edition, which is \u00a384.99 from Game in the UK, or $99.99 from Amazon US, and includes all of the above (except the War Chest is gold), along with two story expansions: The Blade of Galadriel and The Desolation of Mordor. It also comes in a nifty steelbook case.\n\nFinally, for the real die-hards there\u2019s the Mithril Edition, which any LotR fan will know is the best of all the fictional metals. That\u2019s an Amazon exclusive in the UK, and a GameStop exclusive in the US and includes everything in the Gold Edition along with some physical goodies: a magnetic Ring of Power, a cloth map of Mordor, some stickers and lithographs, a soundtrack CD, and the real attraction: a 12in Tar-Goroth Balrog vs. Carnan Drake statue, which does look pretty cool, to be fair. It\u2019ll set you back \u00a3199.99/$299.99.\n\nOh, and if you never played the original Shadow of Mordor, you can grab a Game of the Year copy now for \u00a315/$20.\n\nWhat is the storyline?\n\nThe first announcement trailer for Shadow of War showed off the game\u2019s story, which picks up shortly after the end of Shadow of Mordor, between The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings, still following Talion and Celebrimbor.\n\nRead next: Best PC games\n\nThey\u2019ve forged a new Ring of Power, and are going behind enemy lines into Mordor to try and spread dissent and undermine Sauron, turning his own army against him. It looks like that will involve fighting a Balrog, the Nazgul, and maybe even Sauron himself along the way - watch the trailer for yourself at the top of the page to see more.\n\nWhat are the gameplay features?\n\nWhile the announcement trailer teased the game\u2019s story, there was little (well, zero) gameplay on display, so we don\u2019t know a lot about what to expect. The press release gives us a little more insight, promising a major expansion to the first game\u2019s innovative Nemesis system, which saw named NPC enemies respond to and pursue the player character across the game.\n\n\u201cThe robust personalization from the first game is now applied to the entire world where the environments and characters are all shaped by player actions and decisions, creating a personal world unique to every gameplay experience,\u201d Warner Bros. claims.\n\nRead next: Best PS4 games\n\nThe new additions include Followers, who \u201cbring about entirely new stories of loyalty, betrayal and revenge,\u201d and Nemesis Fortresses, which \u201callows player to utilize different strategies to conquer dynamic strongholds and create personalized worlds with their unique Orc army.\u201d\n\nThere will be a gameplay reveal on 8 March which will hopefully show us more, and we\u2019ll update this article with all the latest news at that point.", 
        "title": "Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor Sequel Leaked by Retailer", 
        "trend": "Middle-earth", 
        "body0": "Middle-Earth: Shadow of Mordor was a game about guerrilla warfare... and also falling in love with orcs. By contrast, Middle-Earth: Shadow of War is a game about full-scale warfare... and also falling in love with orcs.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShadow of War is a painfully generic subtitle, but there is a ring of truth to it. I got to see a demo of the game in action last week during GDC, and developer Monolith wasted no time with small stuff. This one is all about armies. Assembling them, fighting them, telling them they are all very good, strong orc boys\u2014those kinds of things. Your goal? To take back Mordor and territories beyond from Sauron\u2019s forces.\n\nSauron, because he is extremely vain, has scarred the land with his unmistakable brand of jagged, impractical architecture, so you\u2019ve got your work cut out for you. Nemesis-System-powered overlords command fortresses, each of which are staffed by Nemesis-System-powered warchiefs (which were the highest rank of orc in the previous game) and hundreds of other orcs. Fortress assaults are the culmination of copious open-world sandbox shenanigans, so you can, say, covertly turn a warchief to your side and have him betray his former overlord BFF in the heat of a fortress battle, which is neat.\n\nUnfortunately, Monolith didn\u2019t show us any open-world mischief-making, opting instead to leap straight into a fortress takeover. Immediately, however, we got to see a cool example of the Nemesis System in action. As main character Talion and his orcs stormed the front gates, a powerful enemy orc called out, swearing vengeance. Apparently, this orc used to be part of Talion\u2019s army, but he got left behind during a botched mission. Not only did he \u201cdie,\u201d but he also got his feelings hurt! Oh, and Sauron pumped him full of dark magic, so he had a lot going on, you know?\n\nThis orc managed to corner Talion and start choking the life out of him, but then the Nemesis System kicked in again, this time with added friendship. One of Talion\u2019s warchiefs, an archer orc named Mozu Deadeye, loosed an arrow in the nick of time, eliminating the traitorous orc in gruesome fashion. Then several different varieties of shit hit the fan all at once.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFirst, a clearly deranged dancing orc, upon witnessing the death of the orc Talion\u2019s warchief killed, dumped oil on Talion\u2019s frontline. Then he set everybody on fire. In retaliation, Talion freed a dragon from a cage, which he scaled and used his ghost elf powers to \u201cdominate.\u201d The result? A fully flyable dragon.\n\nAfter soaring between buildings and lighting somewhere in the neighborhood of a whole neighborhood of orcs on fire, Talion flew his dragon into a cave troll. The dragon didn\u2019t fare so well, but neither did the cave troll, and Talion was able to capitalize. He was then able to waltz into the fortress\u2019 main keep, where he encountered its overlord.\n\nOrcs aren\u2019t the only Mordor denizens in positions of power this time around. This particular overlord was a gigantic troll, and a boss fight was clearly imminent. It was not, however, a canned showdown. This troll also had Nemesis characteristics, and he reacted to specific damage Talion caused to his fortress. He was especially upset that his dragon got fashioned into a designer handbag by a cave troll, something I think we can all identify with.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSponsored\n\nThe overlord was multiple times Talion\u2019s size, so the person controlling him chose to evade and fire arrows. In retaliation, the overlord physically picked up his own orcs and hurled them at Talion (let it never be said that the Mordor games lack a sense of humor\u2014at least, not entirely). He also set giant grooves in the ground on fire, confining the area in which Talion could maneuver. Thing began to look pretty dire for our intrepid hero. At the last possible second, however, Talion gave a few of his own orcs the signal to intervene, distracting the overlord long enough for Talion to strike a decisive blow with his ghost elf powers. Mission accomplished.\n\nAt that point, our demonstrator was given the option to staff the newly overtaken fortress with his own orcs. Depending on who he picked, the fortress would change. He could also directly upgrade the fortress and install new defenses. Sauron\u2019s forces will try to retake fortresses when they\u2019re feeling sufficiently bold, so you\u2019ve always gotta be prepared.\n\nThe demo ended there, but I made sure to ask about upgrades to the Nemesis System, because that\u2019s probably why you\u2019re reading this, and I honestly can\u2019t blame you. Here\u2019s what I found out:\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn Shadow of Mordor, orcs didn\u2019t really have much personality after you dominated them. This time around, there\u2019ll be a greater focus on a wide variety of orc interactions. Friendships can be just as powerful and lasting as rivalries. As we learned in the demo, however, you\u2019ll probably want to be careful about betraying your big green battle buddies. Some of them will take it very personally.\n\n\n\nOrcs have relationships with each other, too. They can be rivals, or they can have blood brothers that they feel especially bonded to. They can also possess hates, fears, and reactions not only to things like fire and poison\u2014as they did in the first game\u2014but also what happens to their master, their best friend, or you.\n\nMonolith is focusing on making individual orcs memorable in multiple ways. They\u2019re focusing a lot on when and why orcs confront you. Visually, meanwhile, they\u2019re expanding the possible palette of options significantly. For instance, where Shadow of Mordor might\u2019ve given you an orc with basic facial scars, Shadow of War will give you one that\u2019s got scars on his face and body, and also maybe he sustained serious burns, which means he\u2019ll react strongly to fire. Instead of attacking you entirely at random, he\u2019ll likely appear when there\u2019s fire involved. Basically, Monolith is trying to make these player-created narratives flow more naturally while simultaneously expanding the ways in which they can occur.\n\nIn Shadow of War, there are multiple orc tribes with different characteristics and specialties. For instance, the Feral Tribe specializes in hunting, trapping, and using monsters in battle. Depending on which tribe an overlord orc belongs to, their fortress will be entirely different.\n\n\n\nYour orcs don\u2019t always have to be by your side. You can even send them away to do missions, assassinations, and things of the like.\n\n\n\nYou won\u2019t be able to dress up or customize your orcs. Reason being, Monolith wants orcs\u2019 appearances to be representative of their stories, not your decisions in a menu.\n\nBased on what I saw of Shadow of War, the game looks like a much larger-scale take on the systems-driven shenanigans of the first. I do worry that, with so many ally and enemy orcs in play, individual interactions might become less special, but I can\u2019t say for sure at this point. I\u2019m also concerned that the game could devolve into a cookie-cutter open-world affair where fortress assaults all kinda bleed together, but it sounds like the new and improved Nemesis System will help prevent that.\n\nIt remains to be seen how this patchwork quilt of systems old and new fits together, but the underlying ideas are exciting. Middle-Earth: Orcs Have Feelings 2 will be out in August.\n\n",

Order by March 13th to ensure delivery by St. Patrick's Day.\"\n\nCapture the luck of the Irish with this Make America Great Again Hat. While supplies last! BUY NOW: https://t.co/TbqIm56aoY #MAGA pic.twitter.com/PCZLl7HXdD \u2014 Official Team Trump (@TeamTrump) March 2, 2017\n\nThe headgear is embroidered with the Trumps logo 'Make America Great Again' on the front and a four leaf clover on the back. According to the page the caps are \"proudly made in USA\".\n\nIt now waits to be seen if Trump will wear the hat for his meeting with Enda Kenny when the Taoiseach visits the White House on St Patrick's Day. The launch has already caused a stir online with many slamming the $50 price tag.\n\n@TeamTrump @JohnHeide2 ~ I'd love to have one, but don't you think $50 is a bit much? We aren't made of money you know. #MAGA for less. \u2014 Florida Skeptic (@ClayWelsh) March 2, 2017 @ClayWelsh @TeamTrump I TOTALLY AGREE! Working conservatives can't afford $50 for a hat. How about $10 - $15. Are they made in AMERICA? \u2014 John Heide (@JohnHeide2) March 2, 2017\n\nOnline Editors",
