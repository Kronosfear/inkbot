Network  DIFFERENT  Deadly  Alien  We ve found 220 planets capable of sustaining life  Most are nothing like our own  Their stars are strange  Their weather is upside down   Does this make us the alien freaks   Astronomers have been busily scanning the skies for life giving worlds since the 1990s  But it was not until the Kepler space telescope cast its eye over a narrow band of our galaxy that we got to see simply how many planets there really are out there   Kepler alone has so far spotted 4000 of them  The fact that 0 05 per cent of these sit in orbits warm enough for liquid water has enormous implications for the existence of life   But the real eye opener is where most of these worlds are   Most don t orbit yellow stars like our own   Instead  we keep finding them around red dwarfs   These are the most abundant stars in our galaxy  making up some 75 per cent of the Milky Way   There s nothing particularly special about them   They re dim  They re ruddy  They re small   But everything from the colour of the sky  the behaviour of the winds and the shape of the seasons on the planets around them are unlike anything we have experienced  Their geography is also completely different to our own   All this would drive life in unexpected directions   It s an alternate reality that has set planetary scientists and exobiologists scrabbling to model and comprehend   So far the odds appear loaded against life evolving around red dwarfs  But science is still at the stage of figuring out how many dice there are   This isn t easy given how utterly alien these planets are   But  given the sheer number of red dwarf stars in our galaxy  the chances are life will have gotten off the ground somewhere   And the discovery of seven Earth like worlds around the red dwarf star TRAPPIST 1   with six of them capable of holding water   adds new weight to the dice   GIVER OF LIFE  The  thing  about red dwarf stars like TRAPPIST 1 is their temperature   They re not as hot as our Sun  But they live a lot longer    You have to be really very close in order for your planet to have temperatures on the surface like those we have on Earth   says associate professor in Space Science Graziella Caprarelli of the University of South Australia   The closer you have a planet to a star  the more problems you may encounter  Solar flares  for example    Life is a game of numbers   Dr Caprarelli says   So you can be unlucky one day and you die  but your species may also be somewhere else so it survives  So events like solar flares in that context probably won t do much damage  Once life is established  it s established    The biggest hurdle life faces under a red dwarf is its weak light   Its radiation is also most intense at different wavelengths than we get from the Sun  Peak output   where it is the most intense  where you get the most photons   is in the infra red range  From our Sun  the peak intensity is in the blue green range   So what would a world be like in the infra red    If there is water on the planet  then water absorbs the infra red radiation quite strongly   Dr Caprarelli says   This water will be warmed up a lot  Much more than it is on Earth  So if the water is so much hotter  you can expect much more evaporation    Which brings us to the heart of the matter  Clouds   Once clouds have formed a planet can trap an atmosphere underneath  Their presence also helps keep life giving water liquid    It is something that would work in favour of producing habitable planets around red dwarfs   she says   EXPLORING A NEW WORLD  One particular characteristic will drive the shape of worlds orbiting stars like TRAPPIST 1  tidal lock   These planets will have their spin gradually slowed over the course of a billion years  Eventually  they simply stop   Essentially  the sun never rises or sets  It remains fixed at one point in the sky   There is no day and night  Just one or the other   and many shades of red between   It s something that has severe implications for climate and life  Exactly what remains uncertain  But science is attempting to extrapolate   The dark side of a water rich planet is almost certainly going to be one vast network of tightly packed glaciers and fields of ice   The sunward side would be searing hot   It s the transitional edge between the two which is most likely to be  just right    It s a twilight zone   It s called the  terminator   the boundary between night and day  Perpetual dusk  Eternal dawn   It s also likely an environment of contrasts  In the shadows  ice  In the sunlight  dust  In between  life giving liquid water   Such water would create a potential  ring of life    Conditions could range from steamy tropical swamps through to frigid ponds   all within a few hundred kilometres  Each sub climate would be an almost permanent band encircling the entire planet  On Earth  of course  our seasons change as the planet wobbles in its spin   But Dr Caprarelli says there is one major consequence of liquid water that could broaden a red dwarf world s habitability  Weather   There s likely to be lots of it as hot air and evaporating water directly beneath the red sun rises   sucking cooler air in from below and depositing heat and moisture deep on the dark side    It comes back to the clouds   Dr Caprarelli says    Because it has just one side facing the sun  the planet will have temperature gradients  Because of these temperature gradients  it will generate very strong winds  And because of the winds  clouds would be redistributed around the planet in a more or less uniform way    The outcome  More evenly balanced temperatures   The fleshy body of this 'plant' is mostly underground  save for the spectacular rosette of petals that trap moisture and  with the aid of symbiotic microbes  harness sunlight  While the mature organism is immobile and unthinking  its wind blown seeds possess the limited degree of self awareness necessary to navigate it to a site suitable for germination    Dr Brian Choo  OF A DIFFERENT MOULD  Some speculate that red dwarf worlds would be dead  with all their water permanently locked away in ice  Whatever portion had faced their star would have boiled away into steam  only to fall as snow once it wafted over the dusk line   Others believe there is much more to the geology of these worlds than that   Dr Caprarelli suspects most red dwarf planets face a fate like Venus  with runaway greenhouse effects generated by excessive evaporation    But the beauty of red dwarfs is that there are so many of them   Dr Caprarelli says    Statistically  somewhere a red dwarf might have a planet that had all of the right conditions at the same time so that life can emerge and evolve    A variety of landscapes would likely be carved out by such geological processes  These would then gradually erode under the influence of wind and rain   Under a blanket of clouds  enormous glaciers near the rim of perpetual night and day could gradually be melted by the warm air circulating in from the sunward face  Some may even slip into the sunlight  Such glaciers would probably be sitting on sheets of liquid water   produced purely by the friction of their immense weight   Vein like valleys left from ancient geological activity could funnel this water deep into the sunward face  kept largely chilled by the permanent shadows cast by cliffs and eroded river banks   Another mitigating factor for life would be that these planets will not have always been tidal locked  Dr Caprarelli says   For their first billion years or so  they would have spun  This would give them internal friction  heating up their cores  Such geothermal activity would power a magnetosphere to protect the planet from flares   Combined  these elements could produce an environment in which microorganisms could evolve   With the right roll of the dice  these could then develop to harness the energy of their weak stars  she says  If they can do this by the time their planet grinds to a halt  life will have become well entrenched   Such a planet would be primed for evolution   This odd creature grazes on low growing lichen like vegetation and digs for buried tubers  The low slung body and armoured carapace permit it to forage during the blistering windstorms that scour surface  The paddle like tail and vestigial fins betray an aquatic larval stage in the cool lakes at the edge of the melting dark zone glaciers    Dr Brian Choo  EYE OF THE BEHOLDER  Earth like evolution requires billions of years  Notably  red dwarfs live much longer than our own yellow star   But time is not enough  You need the right physical conditions  On top of that  life needs to thrive for it to become dominant enough for advanced evolution to begin to apply   Even the slightest variation in just one element could reshape such a world  A few degrees here  a little less water there   whether or not microbes emit C02   could tip the balance away from supporting advanced life and into a runaway greenhouse effect   Dr Caprarelli s vision is for a thriving red dwarf world is one covered in oceans   Whatever the world  she says  the more water  the stronger the pulse of life   Advanced life only exploded on Earth when photosynthesising vegetation started colonising the land  The simple change in the planet s surface colour   along with the gases the plants emitted   went on to influence temperatures  Essentially  they terraformed the Earth for themselves   Under a red dwarf  it would need to be something different    On a planet where the radiation coming from its star is mostly skewed towards the infra red  then this microorganism wouldn t have enough photons to run the metabolic processes that require energy   Dr Caprarelli says   Therefore it would need to adapt to being able to absorb all of the wavelengths that fall on it  Will it be able to do it  I think maybe yes  but it s another challenge life there would have to face    This would involve plants being very dark  even black  Animals would need transluscent skin    Where life is involved  everything is possible   Dr Caprarelli says   Whether it is probable is another story    BLINK  Then there are those astrophysicists and planetary scientists who reject the concept of tidal locked Goldilocks planets altogether   This could mean more red dwarf worlds could be habitable than expected   Some argue the mere presence of an atmosphere would be enough to impel a planet s rotation  This  in turn  would drive a magnetic field and weather systems similar to our own   Such a magnetic field would act as a life giving shield  improving the chances of a red dwarf planet holding an atmosphere in place and allowing life to develop on the surface below   Auroras could often extend across the entire sky  Though cataclysmic mass extinctions would still be an occasional occurrence   But somewhere  some creature may have already looked up from its refuge into the glowing  ruddy sky and wondered    Is there life out there   Reporting  Jamie Seidel   Artwork  Steven Grice   Animation  Steven Grice    Red dwarf climate  University of South

        "body0": "Wonderful potentially habitable worlds around TRAPPIST 1  Posted by Franck Marchis  22 02 2017 12 00 CST  Topics  extrasolar planets  This post originally appeared on Franck Marchis' Cosmic Diary blog and is reposted here with his permission   In May 2016  Michael Gillon and his team announced the discovery of three Earth sized exoplanets around TRAPPIST 1  an ultra cool M dwarf star  using the small TRAPPIST telescope at ESO La Silla  Chile  It was an exciting discovery yet on that day no one could possibly have imagined that less than a year later they would make another significant discovery involving the same system  But here we are  today  they announced in Nature the discovery of seven potentially habitable Earth like worlds   NASA   JPL Caltech The TRAPPIST 1 system  Where might liquid water exist  This representation of the Trappist 1 system shows which planets could harbor liquid water  The inner three planets are likely too hot  and the outer planet is probably too cold  but the middle three planets might be just right  This representation of the Trappist 1 system shows which planets could harbor liquid water  The inner three planets are likely too hot  and the outer planet is probably too cold  but the middle three planets might be just right   The star  named TRAPPIST 1  is a fairly inconspicuous star in our Milky Way  Small  8  the mass of the sun  and cold  half the temperature of the sun   it is a member of an ultra cool dwarf population that represents 15  of the star population of our galaxy  In 2016  Gillon and his team detected the transit  i e   the shadow of a planet passing between its host star and us  of three exoplanets at the inner edge of the habitable zone of their star   Energized and excited by this discovery  the team requested and received additional telescope time to follow up on this system during the second half of 2016  The NASA Spitzer telescope is one of the facilities they selected for an ambitious program that called for monitoring the TRAPPIST 1 system almost continuously for twenty days  Spitzer and other ground based telescopes allowed the team to detect thirty four transits  more than they had anticipated  suggesting the existence of additional exoplanets in the system   After an careful analysis  the data revealed the presence of seven Earth sized exoplanets  named TRAPPIST 1b  c  d  e  f  g  and h  in orbit around this M type star  Because their orbital periods are short  less than twelve days for planets b to g   several transits were detected during the campaign  Accurately measurements of those tiny events  0 6  dimming of the star  provide a wealth of information about the planets  orbits  sizes  and even masses by measuring precisely the timings of the transits which are perturbed by the gravity of other planets   F  Marchis   H  Marchis Trappist 1 top view Top view of the Trappist 1 planetary system showing the circular orbits of the seven Earth like exoplanets

Mercury orbits at 0 39 AU from our sun  This is NOT equivalent to our solar system  but more a minuscule version of it  comparable in size mass ratio to Jupiter and its Galilean Moons     the most

version of it  comparable in size mass ratio to Jupiter and its Galilean Moons  Similar to our solar system  these exoplanets travel circular orbits all of which go in the same direction  They probably formed more than 500 million years ago together with their star     all of which go in the same direction  They probably formed more than 500 million years ago together with their star  The depth of the transits provides a measurement of the radius of the planets   which are similar to Earth  b  c  e  f  g  or Mars  d  h  so they range from 75  to 110  the size of Earth       which are similar to Earth  b  c  e  f  g  or Mars  d  h  so they range from 75  to 110  the size of Earth  The data are accurate enough to detect mutual gravitational effects  so we can infer the mass of the first six planets   and hence their density  Those are rocky worlds that range in density from 60 and 117  that of Earth       and hence their density  Those are rocky worlds that range in density from 60 and 117  that of Earth  Considering the amount of energy they receive from the star  these planets might have a temperature suitable for the presence of liquid water on their surface  e f g

Trappist 1  and their radiuses  For comparison  the incident flux of Mercury  Mars and Ceres  as well as the locations of Venus and Mars are added  Trappist 1d receives the same amount energy as Earth   What can t we say about the TRAPPIST 1 system   This is not the first discovery of a system with this many exoplanets  HR8832 and HD10180 have seven planets that were discovered by radial velocity  In both cases  the exoplanets are massive  at least ten times the mass of Earth  The host stars also have a mass similar to our sun  Kepler 90 is another system with seven exoplanets discovered by transit measurements  Several of those exoplanets are larger than Earth and probably ice and gas giants  What is crucial here is that for the first time  we have discovered seven temperate rocky exoplanets in orbit around a M dwarf star  There are many such stars in our galaxy  so there are probably a lot of worlds like these out there     in orbit around a M dwarf star  There are many such stars in our galaxy  so there are probably a lot of worlds like these out there  No  we have not yet discovered a cousin of Earth  much less seven of them  The measurements provide interesting information about these exoplanets  and we can confidently say that six of them are rocky  However  their location in the habitable zone of their star does not imply that they are habitable  For instance  Mars and Venus are in the habitable zone of our Sun  but are not habitable anymore  In other words  it is too early to say if there are oceans on their surface  TRAPPIST 1 is located twenty nine light years from us  so we will probably need the large aperture of the JWST or a dedicated space telescope like ARIEL to detect the presence of an atmosphere and derive its composition  Using the Hubble Space Telescope  the team has tried to detect an exosphere on one of the planets but without success so far     No  we have not detected life on those exoworlds  In my opinion  life is the result of a complex cascade of random events  and we don t really know if those exoplanets  located near an ultra cool star  are suitable for life  They are very close to their star and may be tidally locked  showing the same hemisphere to their star at all times  The existence of life on worlds with temperatures that vary from one hemisphere to the other is difficult to imagine  It will take years of observations and modeling to understand if life can exit on such a strange worlds   NASA   JPL Caltech   F  Marchis The TRAPPIST 1 system Artist's representation of the Trappist 1 system with the

telescope  on steroids   made of four  1 meter robotic telescopes installed at Cerro Paranal  With this telescope  the team will survey 10 times more red dwarfs than TRAPPIST did  So we could expect the discovery of a dozen systems similar to this one soon  We will have the opportunity to explore the diversity of atmospheres and climates on Earth like worlds  and potentially life out there   The discovery of these strange new worlds where life could flourish is the beginning of an exciting time for astronomers and biologists  A time when we are beginning to see the unimaginable  a time when life as we don t know it can be imaged and studied  We will probably need to build complex and expensive instruments to understand those worlds but what an astonishing  awe inspiring  life changing

Hospitals pressured to reject foreign students because of Trump policy   by the Boston Globe s Michael Levenson   Hospitals are under intense pressure to reject qualified international medical students applying for residencies in the United States because of fears that President Trump s immigration policies may bar the students from entering the country  educators and hospital administrators say  As many as 1 000 medical school graduates may be unfairly penalized because of their country of origin  medical school officials say  Massachusetts could be hit particularly hard because the state is home to some of the world s leading teaching hospitals as well as smaller community hospitals that typically depend on a large pool of foreign medical talent    The concern over Trump s policies    particularly his restriction on travel from seven majority Muslim countries    has added an unusual amount of anxiety to the upcoming  Match Day    when medical students learn

issues new immigration enforcement policies  says goal is not  mass deportations    by WaPo s David Nakamura   The Trump administration on Tuesday sought to allay growing fears among immigrant communities over wide ranging new directives to ramp up enforcement against illegal immigrants  insisting the measures are not intended to produce  mass deportations   Federal officials cautioned that many of the changes detailed in a pair of memos from Homeland Security Secretary John F  Kelly will take time to implement because of costs and logistical challenges and that border patrol agents and immigration officers will use their expanded powers with care and discretion  Yet the official public rollout of Kelly s directives  first disclosed in media reports over the weekend  was met with outrage from immigrant rights advocates over concerns the new policies will result in widespread abuses as authorities attempt to fulfill President Trump s goals of tightening border control   http

        "body2": "A rollicking panel with Max Martin and Shellback had more than its share of unscripted moments   Justin Timberlake literally got on bended knee before legendary singer songwriter Bill Withers and credited his stone cold classic  Lovely Day  with inspiring his smash hit  Can't Stop the Feeling    It's very serendipitous that this man is sitting with us here today   said an effusive Timberlake   It was one of many unscripted moments at a revealing and rollicking panel discussion and screening of Trolls for which Timberlake was film's executive producer of music  The evening was presented by the Songwriters Hall of Fame West Coast Committee for an audience of SHOF and Academy of Motion Pictures Arts   Sciences members at the 20th Century Fox Studios in West Los Angeles where it was also revealed that Timberlake would perform  Can't Stop the Feeling  at next week's Oscar ceremony   The dynamic panel also included a rare appearance by superstar producer Max Martin  a nominee for this year's Songwriters Hall of Fame  and his fellow producer Shellback  Karl Johan Schuster  who together with Timberlake created the music for Trolls   Following introductory remarks by Songwriters Hall of Fame West Coast committee chair Mary Jo Mennella and Universal Music Publishing Group president and SHOF board member Evan Lamberg who recounted  Can't Stop the Feeling 's runaways success and welcomed Timberlake to the stage by saying  other than Michael Jackson  I think he's going to go down as the greatest entertainer of our generation    This  however  was followed not by JT's expected entrance but by the surprise appearance of Withers who unexpectedly took the stage  The soul crooner's sudden walk out elicited delight and awe from the hundreds who had braved a massive Los Angeles rain storm and gave Withers a standing ovation  This also meant that Timberlake marched out while Lamberg recounted Withers' storied career    a moment that previewed the loosey goosey nature of the discussion   To wit  Withers  the panel's Songwriters Hall of Fame moderator  didn't launch immediately into a discussion of his panel's impressive music bona fides or Trolls but rather spoke about shoes  Timberlake and Withers  it turns out  were previously on a panel together in which the 78 year old enviously recalled the pop singer's stylish shoes stealing the show   That bothered me   he said  so for this panel he was more prepared   I went deep into my closet and this time I broke out my 1956 Stetson Detroit pimp shoes   Withers said proudly  Timberlake  who similarly recalled the meeting  said he decided to wear his modest Adidas Stan Smiths  out of respect    The word Timberlake repeated most often when describing his good fortune with the film and the smash single was  serendipity   He dropped it when describing the call from Dreamworks and meeting with the former powerful studio head Jeffrey Katzenberg who asked him to do all the film's music  And he used it again when at the same time he was rekindling his relationship with the great producer Max Martin for his next record and whom he hadn't worked with since his  NSYNC days when he was 15 years old  i e   a hundred thousand years ago   as they kept repeating    Timberlake  who voiced the role of Branch in the animated film  said his reaction to first seeing the fantastical animated outtake was   Whoa  look at their hair  Am I high right now   But he especially admired Trolls' message for young girls  Two of the film's protagonists are heroic and brave females  Poppy  voiced by Anna Kendrick  and Bridget  Zooey Deschanel   who doesn't conform to traditional notions of beauty   Another serendipitous scenario involved the former head of of Troll's movie studio   I have a very good relationship with Jeffrey Katzenberg who has been the head of Dreamworks for years and years and years and years   said Timberlake   It felt like this was something that he wanted to be his swan song at the company  Katzenberg stepped down as head of Dreamworks Animation last August after it was acquired by Comcast   And the movie and what they were doing with it and how cutting edge it was and how funny and irrelevant they were making it felt like a really great opportunity    For producers Martin and Shellback  who were in the preliminary stages of planning to work with Timberlake on his next record the timing also proved propitious   It was an opportunity to do something not so serious   Martin said   it was fun    As laid back and loose as creating the soundtrack may have been  the Oscar nominated trio said they  felt a lot of pressure  to create a hit song for the movie's crescendo  This because Trolls is filled with classic jams such as Earth  Wind   Fire's  September   Lionel Richie's  Hello   Simon   Garfunkel's  Sounds of Silence  and the film's emotional catharsis that is Cyndi Lauper's  True Colors  that is hard to compete with   Withers compared the pressure and competition the trio felt to create  Can't Stop the Feeling  with what he felt opening for Donny Hathaway   Donny was a bad dude   Withers noted   He was not reticent about saying 'You better bring it tonight because I'm coming for you   To which Withers would respond in kind   People make each other better   he concluded   Withers asked if the trio faced any major changes by A R people  an acronym for  artist and repertoire  whom the soul great disparaged as  antagonistic and redundant   to much applause  Though the trio said there weren't any major changes there were some lyrical adjustments  Timberlake recalled Katzenberg along with the film's director and producers coming by the studio to read a scene in which Katzenberg himself read the part of one of Trolls' Bergen characters  Timberlake imitated him reading it in a monster like voice saying  Hmmmm  do you really think this will make me happy    Timberlake  as the film's executive producer of music  fondly recalled working with the cast that included Gwen Stefani  James Cordon and Ariana Grande   There was a moment I had with Anna Kendrick who is a phenomenal singer and fantastic actress   Timberlake said   She was singing the song at a certain pace and I was in the control room and she was in the booth and I'm saying 'a little more like this ' And she goes  'You know I feel like I'm just singing it like you and that makes you think it's really good ' And I said  'well yeah ' But that's the example of the relationship I had with all the actors and they all can sing their guts out  I had a very easy job when recording and producing all of them    As for what's next  Timberlake mentioned he had just finished working with Woody Allen  while Martin and Shellback weren't sure what they could mention but said they would be working with Timberlake on his next album  JT  interrupted and said   These guys are humble  they're working with Pink and Taylor Swift and all your favorite artists  Whoever you like that you know and whoever you like that you don't know  in the next three years    that's them  ",

on a proposed E P A  rule related to so called Startup  Shutdown and Malfunction Emissions   The most frequent correspondence was with Devon Energy  which has aggressively challenged rules proposed by the E P A  and the Department of Interior s Bureau of Land Management  which controls drilling on federal lands   widespread in the west  In the 2014 election cycle  Devon was one of the top contributors to the Republican Attorneys General Association  which Mr  Pruitt led for two years during that period   In a March 2013 letter to Mr  Pruitt s office  William Whitsitt  then an executive vice president of Devon  referred to a letter his company had drafted for Mr  Pruitt to deliver  on Oklahoma state stationery  to Obama administration officials  Mr  Pruitt  meeting with White House officials  made the case that the rule  which would rein in planet warming methane emissions  would be harmful to his state s economy  His argument was taken directly from Mr  Whitsitt s draft language    To follow up on my conversations with Attorney General Pruitt and you  I believe that a meeting   or perhaps more efficient  a conference call   with OIRA  the OMB Office of Information and Regulatory Analysis  on the BLM rule should be requested right away   Mr  Whitsitt wrote   The attached draft letter  or something like it that Scott is comfortable talking from and sending to the acting director to whom the letter is addressed  could be the basis for the meeting or call    Advertisement Continue reading the main story  The letter referred to the section of the White House Office of Management and Budget that coordinates regulations throughout the government   Senate Democrats last week unsuccessfully urged their colleagues to delay a vote on Mr  Pruitt s confirmation until the emails were released   The emails do not appear to include any request for his intervention explicitly in exchange for campaign contributions  although Mr  Pruitt was separately working as a member of the Republican Attorneys General Association to raise money from many of the same companies   Despite the large volume of correspondence between Mr  Pruitt s office and the industry players  the emails are unlikely to cause Mr  Pruitt significant new problems  They do expand on email exchanges or topics that previously had been disclosed   The Oklahoma attorney general s office has withheld some documents  asking the judge to determine if they can be exempted from the order requiring their release  There are also other pending open records requests  from the Center for Media and

president to go after leakers   Obama often did   but it is unusual for a president to announce that he is pushing the Justice Department to do so  Charlie Savage and Eric Lichtblau write for The New
