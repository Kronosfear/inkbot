        "body0": "Photo\n\nThe Knicks did not make any moves before last week\u2019s trade deadline, but on Monday morning they made several, waiving one veteran player, Brandon Jennings, and announcing that another, Joakim Noah, would undergo knee surgery, which could force him to miss the remainder of the regular season.\n\nJennings, 27, played 58 games for the Knicks this season after signing a one-year contract last summer. He averaged 8.6 points and 4.9 assists per game as the backup to Derrick Rose at point guard. There were moments when he impressed, particularly when he was spearheading the second unit. There were also moments when he made befuddling turnovers.\n\nIn any case, the Knicks did not view him as anything more than a stopgap. And by waiving him they will potentially free playing time at point guard for 24-year-old Chasson Randle, who played his college ball at Stanford and had a stint with the Knicks\u2019 Development League team this season before signing with the Philadelphia 76ers in January.\n\nBut the Sixers waived him last week and that, in turn, allowed him to rejoin the Knicks, for whom he should get a chance to play in the remaining 23 games of a desultory season in which New York has little chance of qualifying for the playoffs.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nJennings\u2019s departure could also give more playing time to Ron Baker, 23, the rookie point guard who has stood out in a couple of games this season but who has often found it hard to get off the bench.\n\nAs for Rose, he is in the final season of the multiyear contract he signed with the Chicago Bulls before the Knicks acquired him last summer. The Knicks nearly shipped him last week to the Minnesota Timberwolves for Ricky Rubio, but the deal fell through just as the trade deadline arrived.\n\nSign Up for the Sports Newsletter Get the big sports news, highlights and analysis from Times journalists, with distinctive takes on games and some behind-the-scenes surprises, delivered to your inbox every week.

That would free even more playing time in the backcourt for the remainder of the season, but it would also make it harder for the Knicks to win games.\n\nAs for Noah, he was the Knicks\u2019 most expensive free-agent addition in the last off-season, receiving a four-year, $72 million deal to start at center despite the fact that, at age 32, he was increasingly succumbing to the wear and tear of the N.B.A.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHe played in only 29 games for Chicago last season and, up until now, missed 13 of the Knicks\u2019 59 games this season. He was averaging 5 points and 8.7 rebounds per game, and 22.1 minutes. He looked a step slow on defense some of the time and, in a sense, had been supplanted as the starting center by the rookie Willy Hernangomez.\n\nRandle, meanwhile, was with the Knicks in their preseason training camp, then played with the Westchester Knicks in the Development League, and then signed two 10-day contracts with the 76ers before eventually signing a three-year contract. But he was waived by Philadelphia to clear roster space to complete the recent Nerlens Noel trade with the Dallas Mavericks.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nRandle was undrafted out of Stanford in 2015, played in the Czech Republic last season and averaged only 9.3 minutes a game in his stint in Philadelphia. But the Knicks were familiar with him and impressed enough to bring him back.\n\n\u201cWe loved Chasson, his ability, how he can play,\u201d Jeff Hornacek, the Knicks\u2019 coach, said of Randle last month after the Sixers first signed him. \u201cHe\u2019s a smart player, knows how to play the game, shoot the ball. Chasson can play.\u201d\n\nAnd now he will play for the Knicks, at least in the weeks ahead.",

        "trend": "Alshon Jeffery", 
        "body0": "Stacy Revere/Getty Images\n\nAfter using the franchise tag on wide receiver Alshon Jeffery last offseason, the Chicago Bears are reportedly not expected to do the same this year.\n\nAccording to NFL Network's Ian Rapoport, Chicago is likely to allow the 27-year-old to hit the open market. Jeff Dickerson of ESPN confirmed Rapoport's report.\n\nJeffery finished 2016 with 52 receptions for 821 yards and two touchdowns. He missed four games due to a suspension for violating the NFL's performance-enhancing drug policy.\n\nHe also sat out seven games in 2015 due to injury, but he was productive when healthy with 807 yards and four scores.\n\nThe second-round pick out of South Carolina topped the 1,000-yard mark in both 2013 and 2014, and he was named to his only Pro Bowl in 2013 after a career-high 89 catches and 1,421 yards to go along with seven touchdowns.\n\nAt 6'4\" and 230 pounds, Jeffery is a matchup nightmare for opposing cornerbacks, but his inability to remain on the field in recent years makes investing heavily in him risky.\n\nAccording to Jason La Canfora of CBSSports.com, however, the Philadelphia Eagles are among the teams that may be willing to pay a significant price to land him.\n\nShould the Bears allow Jeffery to walk, they may need to turn to the draft.\n\nKevin White was Chicago's first-round pick in 2015, but he has just 19 receptions in four career games due to injury. Cameron Meredith emerged to lead the Bears with 66 grabs for 888 yards and four TDs in 2016, and veteran Eddie Royal remains in the mix as a slot receiver as well.\n\nChicago also has an unsettled quarterback situation with Jay Cutler likely to be sent packing, but it does own the No. 3 overall pick in the draft. Should the Bears bring in a young quarterback without a true No. 1 wideout, it will make the learning curve even steeper.", 
        "body2": "What we \"knew\" most about the 2016 Bears heading into the season is that, offensively, Jay Cutler and Alshon Jeffery would be the straws that stirred the offensive drink.\n\nThanks to injuries, suspension and a perfect storm that resulted in a 3-13 season, the straw had a hole in it, the team still couldn't collectively close out games and a fifth-round rookie (Jordan Howard) and a second-year undrafted free agent (Cam Meredith) turned into the greatest causes for optimism on that side of the ball.\n\nThe news that the team is shopping Cutler is hardly news-bulletin worthy. We've written about Cutler Fatigue here and discussed it on CSN's BearsTalk Podcasts for some time now. A breakup has seemed inevitable after eight years of .500 ball when he's been behind center. The tricky part is finding an alternative that would be a marked improvement for a coaching staff that might need to finish .500 to continue on the job in 2018. Yet that's the gamble that must be taken for a franchise that almost needs to move on, for better or worse, in order to find a way out of the muddy ditch it's found itself in.\n\nCutler must first be deemed healthy enough after labrum surgery on his throwing shoulder - something similar to what Buffalo did with Tyron Taylor this week following groin surgery. But Taylor might be a safer bet to stay with the Bills than Cutler is here. Those medicals might be out there already around the league if shopping has truly begun. And while a new destination for Cutler might not earn him the same salary (roughly $15 million) he'd make here, the thinking here is he'd prefer a fresh start just as much as the Bears want one.\n\nSo let's go shopping.\n\nCleveland? No.\n\nSan Francisco as a stopgap starter? Maybe. There's tons of salary cap space while a successor is groomed, and there's the Shanahan (Kyle/Mike) Factor. But more losing.\n\nHow about Jacksonville to push his young clone, Blake Bortles? Perhaps. There's still a loaded, talented young defense that has yet to reach a promising ceiling, and a couple of talented receivers.\n\nThe Los Angeles Rams could provide a push for Jared Goff (though it's hard not to see Goff being the starter, for better or worse). But if something should happen, Cutler would be ready, with Todd Gurley, what should be a respectable defense and a location close to where wife Kristin Cavallari can return to actressing.\n\nJay in Buffalo? Good one!\n\nArizona has already shot down interest.\n\nWe don't see Denver wanting him back as they await Paxton Lynch's maturity with Trevor Siemian as a bridge.\n\nReuniting with Adam Gase in Miami could be an option with Ryan Tannehill's health still a mystery.\n\nThen there's always Houston. I'm looking for Tony Romo's ultimate destination impacting Jay's.\n\nBut retiring, as some reports this week suggested? No. Despite the public perception, Jay is a competitor, and I truly believe that still runs through him. He may not get to prove his reputation wrong before he retires, but despite what body language experts feel, I believe he'd still like to prove something. But I'm also not counting on any team giving up a draft pick for him. Teams know the Bears will release him, but if a club lower on the waiver claim wire truly desires him, Ryan Pace has squeezed something out from teams for his players on the discard pile before.\n\nAs for Jeffery, all remains quiet on the franchise tag front. The seal remains tight at Halas Hall over whether there have been any negotiations this past week, and if so, whether they've moved in a positive, long-term direction.\n\nTwo things to keep in mind: the Bears did not tag him last year until the day before the deadline to do so. That deadline this year is March 1. The other is the fact that other teams in similar situations (such as Washington with Kirk Cousins and Kansas City with Eric Berry and Dontari Poe) have yet to make moves either, as that deadline looms. If the Bears determine they'll cut ties with Cutler, Eddie Royal and Lamarr Houston, that will free up another $24 million in cap space on top of the $60 million-plus they have already. Perhaps that factors into the decision on Jeffery, who'd get paid $17 million in 2017 under a second straight franchise tag for a team that needs play-makers and a coaching staff that needs wins next season. Letting him go would require attention and a portion of those dollars to replace him in the draft and/or free agency.\n\nWe leave all our internet/talk radio caller GM's with this question: Would you REALLY want to be in Ryan Pace's shoes this offseason? Can you be as shrewd, wise and run the table to the extent he must, especially at the most important, franchise-shaping position (which, granted, he's put on the back-burner his first two years)? And \"get it right\" to build momentum moving forward for a franchise that's reached the playoffs just once in the past decade? The rebuild remains substantial. And so are the decisions he faces in a crucial offseason.", 
        "body1": "Indianapolis will again become the NFL's hub this week, playing host to the annual scouting combine. As always, much of the TV spotlight and outside hype will center around the 330 draft-eligible invitees who will partake in on-field testing, medical examinations and interview sessions.\n\nYet for Bears general manager Ryan Pace and coach John Fox, the business demands will stretch beyond their draft preparation homework. Pace and Fox are scheduled to meet with reporters Wednesday at the Indianapolis Convention Center to offer their offseason updates. As that session closes in, here are four Bears storylines worth keeping tabs on.\n\nThe big catch\n\nPhotos of Bears wide receiver Alshon Jeffery.\n\nSay this for Alshon Jeffery: He doesn't lack for self-confidence. On the final day of the regular season, after a 28-point loss to the Vikings completed a 3-13 season, Jeffery boldly declared that the Bears would win the Super Bowl next season.\n\nA day later, when asked if he stood behind that proclamation, Jeffery affirmed his stance. \"Damn right,\" he said. \" I really believe it in my heart.\"\n\nMisguided? Probably. Outlandish? Absolutely. But with Jeffery, such bravado comes from a well-intentioned place. The veteran receiver has a competitive streak and a deep belief in his own abilities. And that's not to be overlooked as he prepares to dip his toes into free agency for the first time.\n\nJeffery badly wants to be part of a winner. He also hopes to land a mega contract that will offer him fair compensation and long-term security. So will he prioritize loyalty to the Bears over a desire to land the richest deal possible?\n\nThe consensus around the NFL is that Jeffery will be one of the 10 most talented players to hit the open market March 9. And it's easy to argue that the Bears ultimately need Jeffery more than he needs them. After all, if Jeffery wound up departing, wouldn't that spell trouble for an offense that has only two other receivers \u2014 Cameron Meredith and Kevin White \u2014 locked into the 2017 plans?\n\nStill, don't expect Pace to lose his business discipline if a high-priced auction breaks out on the first day of the new league year.\n\nThe Bears have plenty of room under the salary cap and are very much interested in keeping Jeffery around, even after his 2016 season (52 catches, 821 yards, two touchdowns) was interrupted by a four-game suspension for a violation of the league's policy on performance-enhancing drugs.\n\nBut Pace also isn't hellbent on becoming the highest bidder if Jeffery's price tag shoots too high.\n\nThe Bears still have understandable questions about Jeffery's dependability and potential for growth. So just where will Pace draw the line in his negotiations?\n\nAdding complexity to the issue is the lack of direction the Bears seem to have on offense. Other than a familiar setting, what can the Bears truly sell Jeffery on with yet another new receivers coach (Zach Azzanni), likely a new starting quarterback and a postseason drought that has reached six seasons and counting?\n\nAny takers?\n\nPhotos of Bears quarterback Jay Cutler.\n\nAt last year's combine, Fox labeled quarterback Jay Cutler \"one of the brightest spots\" of his first season in Chicago, lauding the quarterback's mental toughness and ability to execute under pressure. A year later, it seems to be a matter of when, not if, Fox and the Bears will permanently pull the plug on Cutler.\n\nFrom the front office's perspective, think of Cutler as that outdated toaster in the corner of the kitchen that's no longer of much use. The first option: Set him out on a garage sale table and hope someone desperate offers some form of compensation \u2014 anything really \u2014 to take him away. And if no one does? Then he's out to the front porch for the next Salvation Army pickup.\n\nThat, in a nutshell, is how the trade-or-cut question will likely play out in the coming weeks. And the Bears are certain to use their time at the combine to measure outside interest in Cutler.\n\nEven Cutler's biggest backers at Halas Hall seem to understand that new direction is needed at the position. So the Bears must identify the most fruitful separation strategy.\n\nThrough that lens, any public comments Pace or Fox makes this week about Cutler must be properly filtered. Any praise of Cutler's recovery from shoulder surgery or optimism about his future potential should not be interpreted as a vote of confidence in Cutler but more so as a calculated sales pitch to other rabbit-eared NFL general managers.\n\nThe Bears' phone lines are open. Any and all offers will be considered.\n\nThird watch\n\nJonathan Allen Kevin C. Cox / Getty Images Alabama's Jonathan Allen tackles Washington's Myles Gaskin during the Chick-fil-A Peach Bowl on Dec. 31, 2016 in Atlanta.

Cox / Getty Images)\n\nThe Bears own the No. 3 overall pick in April's draft, a nice consolation prize for last season's misery. Now, how will they use it?\n\nIf Pace wants to add his quarterback of the future in Round 1, he'll start with an intense evaluation of Clemson's Deshaun Watson and North Carolina's Mitch Trubisky. Maybe even Notre Dame's DeShone Kizer. But if the 40-year-old GM stays true to a philosophy of taking the best player available, the focus may instead shift to Alabama defensive lineman Jonathan Allen, LSU safety Jamal Adams or Ohio State defensive backs Malik Hooker or Marshon Lattimore.\n\nThe combine will give the Bears a chance to thicken their scouting reports on those defensive difference-makers. Allen might be the safest bet, a disruptive force who would be an immediate starter at end in the Bears' 3-4 defense. Allen is stout against the run and has shown an ability to consistently push the pocket as a pass rusher. His combination of quickness and power is elite and would make him an intriguing fit alongside Eddie Goldman and Akiem Hicks up front.\n\nOpen for business\n\nA scheduling shift pushed this year's combine back on the calendar and closer to the start of free agency, a change that is being celebrated by agents and team executives alike. In recent years, the casual preliminary free-agency discussions that were had at the combine lacked urgency as teams and agents slowly felt each other out. But with the combine now oozing into March and butting up against the opening of the new league year (March 9), there's a sense that the business conversations in Indy will be a lot more meaningful this week.",

Some called the Dominican boom in Philadelphia a \"chain migration,\" word-of-mouth recommendations.\n\nWilliam Dur\u00e1n will commemorate the Dominican Republic Independence Day away from home for the first time in his life.\n\nWhile his compatriots across the Caribbean island take Monday off to flood the streets and raise the national flag in town squares, Dur\u00e1n, 24, will be hard at work in North Philadelphia, a neighborhood he is still getting used to.\n\nDur\u00e1n left the tropics for Philadelphia in December, wanting to \u201cbecome acquainted with another culture\u201d and in search of better pay. A mutual friend landed him an administrative position at a Dominican-owned \u201cmulti-service\u201d office, a staple in North Philadelphia. These sorts of shops offer their clients, mostly Latinos, help with taxes, legal affairs, and remittances.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like a little Dominican Republic here in the U.S.,\u201d Dur\u00e1n said in Spanish. \u201cWherever I go \u2014 a bodega, a supermarket, a restaurant \u2014 I bump into people I know from back home who I had no clue were in Philadelphia.\u201d\n\nAs a result, he won\u2019t be the only one in Philadelphia paying tribute to the Dominican Republic\u2019s independence from Haiti 173 years ago.\n\nThe Dominican population in the city is at a record high, having almost tripled in the last decade, from 7,688 in 2005 to 23,974 in 2015, according to data from the Census Bureau. Dominicans, or Quisqueyanos, surpassed Mexicans in 2010 as the second-largest Hispanic group in the city, trailing only Puerto Ricans, who account for 65 percent of the total Hispanic population.\n\nLike Dur\u00e1n, many recent Dominicans leave their beloved island for higher wages and to join family and friends already settled in Philadelphia. As the community grows in numbers, so does its influence. First- and even second-generation Dominican leaders have emerged, community organizations have expanded, and Dominican-owned businesses continue to boom.\n\nVictor Vazquez-Hernandez, the department chair of social sciences at Miami Dade College, said the Dominican boom in Philadelphia began in the 1990s as thousands of Dominicans left New York City in search of more-affordable housing.\n\n\u201cAs more Dominicans got established in Philadelphia, more came directly from the Dominican Republic,\u201d said Vazquez-Hernandez, who used to teach at Temple University. \u201cAnd they branched out to places like Allentown and Reading. That chain migration really took off.\u201d\n\nLuisa Hernandez, 48, arrived in Philadelphia in 2000 after leaving the Dominican Republic and living two years in Puerto Rico and New York City. She chose Philly for its affordability and economic growth.\n\nLike many Dominican women in Philadelphia, the mother of two is a hair stylist and has owned Ashley Beauty Salon on Sixth Street and Erie Avenue since 2006. She also called the Dominican boom in Philadelphia a \u201cchain migration.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor example, I came here because of a friend, and because of me, about ten other Dominicans have moved to Philadelphia,\u201d Hernandez said of Northeast Philly. \"For years, I never met anyone here from my hometown, Mao. Now, there are so many people from Mao.\u201d\n\nDanilo Burgos, a cofounder of Philadelphia\u2019s Dominican Grocers Association, has his own theory regarding the uptick of Dominicans' arriving from the island.\n\n\u201cPhiladelphia, maybe 10 years ago, started having direct flights to the Dominican Republic,\u201d said the American-born Burgos. \u201cNow we\u2019re starting to see Dominicans that come directly to the city before going through New York or Miami.\u201d\n\nAnd first-generation Dominicans in Philadelphia continue to outnumber American-born Dominicans, according to an Inquirer analysis of 2014 Census Bureau data using IPUMS-USA, a census research project at the University of Minnesota.\n\nWhile 42 percent of the Philadelphia-Dominican population is U.S.-born, 57 percent is foreign-born, presumably in the Dominican Republic. Additionally, 63 percent of Dominicans in Philadelphia are U.S. citizens (either naturalized or U.S.-born), and 34 percent are not U.S. citizens (either visa- and green-card-holders, or here illegally).\n\nDiojenes \u2014 who preferred not to give his last name \u2014 is emblematic of an unknown number of Dominicans who are in Philadelphia illegally.\n\nDiojenes, 40, fled the Dominican Republic in 2010 to Mexico. Guided by armed smugglers \u2014 they were children, 8 to 10 years old, he said \u2014 Diojenes crossed the Rio Grande into McAllen, Texas.\n\nHe was detained by the border patrol and jailed for seven days. His wife, who was in Philadelphia on a visa, helped him post the $7,500 bail and hired an immigration lawyer. Diojenes was released and traveled to Philadelphia as his court case dragged on for years. He stopped appearing in court after two years, fearing the possibility of deportation.\n\n\u201cLook, the U.S. is looking primarily for illegal immigrants with criminal records,\u201d Diojenes said. \u201cI have a clean record. I came here to work.\u201d\n\nIn 2013, he scraped together $95,000 from relatives to open a bodega in North Philadelphia, which now has two employees. Diojenes, a father of three, said his \u201chonest work\u201d has borne fruit.\n\n\u201cYou know, everyone has a dream,\u201d said Diojenes, speaking over the quintessential bachata music blasting in his bodega. \u201cMy dream is to own something that can sustain my family.\u201d\n\nDominicans in the city traditionally have been known for opening bodegas and hair salons.\n\n\u201cIn the '80s, you started seeing a few bodegas,\u201d said Jos\u00e9 Joaqu\u00edn Mota, a co-founder of the Dominican Grocers Association and vice-consul in Philadelphia. \u201cNow, you have over 2,000 bodegas owned by Dominicans.\u201d\n\nMota believes that the Census Bureau numbers underestimate the size of the Dominican community in the city, which he estimates is 50,000.\n\nAt a political level, Dominicans in Philadelphia have yet to elect one of their own into office.\n\nBurgos came close when he placed second in the 197th District State House Democratic primary in 2014, losing to Leslie Acosta, who later resigned\u200b after pleading guilty to conspiracy to commit money laundering.\n\nBurgos, who has worked on the staff of Council members Mar\u00eda D. Qui\u00f1ones-S\u00e1nchez and Allan Domb, said he planned to run again, in 2018.\n\nDominican Republic Independence Day, a day of festivities on the island, is lightly celebrated by some Dominicans in Philadelphia, and even forgotten by others.\n\nHernandez, who has been styling hair in Philadelphia for the last 17 years, said she would have overlooked the national holiday Monday if not reminded. \u201cAll these years here, you lose a bit of the culture.\u201d\n\nBut bodega-owner Diojenes and his wife, Thania, 36, said they always commemorated the national holiday, even if they didn\u2019t take the day off.\n\nBack home, \u201cthe president will address the nation, and businesses will close for the day,\u201d said Thania, beaming from behind the bodega counter. \u201cEverything is jubilation and parties, and a lot of acts of patriotism are performed.\u201d\u200b\n\nTwitter: @luisferre", 
        "body2": "Children in Parc Cadeau often don't get enough to eat. Photo by Mario Ariza\n\nEna Louissaint and her four children have lived for the past year and a half in a ramshackle hut made from scavenged cardboard, faded blankets, flimsy sticks, and corrugated zinc panels. Leaning to one side, it offers little shelter from the hot, incessant wind that sweeps across the dusty outskirts of Anse-\u00e0-Pitres, Haiti. Her place is about a half-hour walk from that remote town of about 20,000 near the Dominican border.\n\nThere's little to eat here. The children \u2014 Duilyel Jan, Elia, Eliyel, and Loudi \u2014 are all under the age of 10. Their hair is brittle and feels hollow. It breaks off when touched, a sign of malnutrition.\n\n\"We eat once a day,\" Louissaint, a tall woman who clearly was once strong and vital but now has a worried face and work-worn hands, says in Spanish. \"We eat corn flour and rice sometimes, when we have it.\"\n\nLouissaint left Haiti when she was 6 years old and grew up some 20 miles away across the border, where she raised yuca, red kidney beans, and pigeon peas on a plot of dry, rocky soil. For most of her life, she was a sharecropper. Eventually, she saved enough money to purchase a herd of goats and operated a small store selling vegetables and clothing.\n\nBut then, in July 2015, roving bands of armed Dominican men whom she calls t\u00edgueres, which translates to both \"thugs\" and \"tigers,\" began showing up on motorcycles in Aguas Negras, the tiny hill town Louissaint called home. They came in the evenings. Often drunk, they carried torches and pistols. They leered at Ena and the other Haitian women of the town, and then they told all of the Haitians to get out \u2014 or else \u2014 regardless of whether they had spent their whole lives there.\n\nLouissaint heard they had burned down a house in the neighboring hamlet of \u00c1vila. The Kreyol-language stations on her radio warned of ethnic violence and that immigrants would soon have to register with the Dominican government. There would be mass deportations and perhaps a reprise of the Parsley Massacre, the 1937 mass murder of as many as 30,000 ethnic Haitians.\n\nSo Ena and her family fled. One day in late July 2015, taking only what she could carry, she simply walked across the border into Haiti. The t\u00edgueres stole everything she left behind. \"We lost the small store we owned, along with our livestock,\" she says, adding that the thieves were never punished.\n\n\"Here, we can barely find water to drink,\" she says, her voice choking with despair. Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nMore shares recommend reddit email\n\n\n\nNow Louissaint is 33 years old and lives in Parc Cadeau, a remote, squalid refugee camp that houses some 2,000 people. It's a haphazard collection of huts, hovels, and lean-tos that stretches alongside a dusty white gravel road. Ena and the others drink water from the dirty Pedernales River or a nearby agricultural canal. Both sources are untreated, and an outbreak of cholera last year killed 14 people.\n\nThere is no electricity and no sanitation in the camp, and dirt paths connect randomly placed abodes. It was all built in a rush with whatever material residents could find. No one expected to live here for years. The sturdiest shelters are composed of sticks covered in mud. They're roofed in thatch that keeps out most of the water. The flimsiest are made of rain-warped cardboard and rusting sheets of corrugated zinc. One family has lived for months in a donated Coleman camping tent. There are no trees for shade, only thorny shrubs.\n\nThough nearby Anse-\u00e1-Pitres and Pedernales are home to a shared bazaar where everything from Norwegian herring to Vietnamese-made Converse sneakers are sold, Louissaint has little chance of finding the cash to become a vendor \u2014 or even of renting land to cultivate. \"Here, we can barely find water to drink sometimes,\" she says, her voice choking with despair, \"and no one is helping.\"\n\nLouissaint holds little hope of returning to the country where she grew up and that she knows best. She doesn't have Haitian or Dominican identity documents. Nor does she have the 50 Dominican pesos to bribe a border guard. And she doesn't want to talk about what happens to Haitian women who get caught crossing the border without the requisite bribe.\n\nA year and a half ago, Louissaint was one of the 750,000 Haitians living and working in the Dominican Republic. But a series of events, set off by a 2013 Dominican Supreme Court ruling that stripped more than 200,000 Dominicans of Haitian descent of their birthright citizenship, forced her to flee. The Inter-American Court of Human Rights, Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, and Oxfam condemned that ruling. The United States government remained mute.\n\nThe law has become part of what is known as la apatrida \u2014 the civil genocide, which declared Dominicans of Haitian descent born as far back as the 1930s to be \"in transit\" \u2014 only passing through \u2014 even if they had spent their entire lives in the Dominican Republic. After October 2013, an already marginalized underclass suddenly couldn't legally own property, vote, or work formally in the private sector. Nor could they send their children to school past the fourth grade. The ruling was found to violate the United Nations' Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The Dominican government ignored that finding.\n\nHaitians and their Dominican-born children, who in some cases barely spoke Kreyol, were required to register by July 2015. They were 7 percent of the population, but few had the required birth certificates and identification cards.\n\nPanic spread. Newspapers in Santo Domingo began speaking of the \"invasion\" of a \"dark army\" whose greatest weapon was a high birth rate \u2014 of the need to defend the fatherland against uneducated savages. Erroneous reports circulated of a Haitian being lynched in the Dominican city of Santiago. Louissaint's worries peaked when the t\u00edgueres showed up in the hills near her home in Pedernales, just across the border from Anse-\u00e0-Pitres.\n\nIn summer 2015, more than 70,000 people fled the Dominican Republic for Haiti. The Dominican government, in an Orwellian twist, called them \"voluntary returnees.\" Like Louissaint, they lost their homes, businesses, and property. For a time, international news and human rights organizations publicized the refugees' problems. Then they were forgotten.\n\nLouissaint and the other residents of Parc Cadeau tell a story of intense intimidation and fear. Long after they were chased down from the hills and left to live in wretched poverty on this dust-filled plain, they remain here, out of the international spotlight and out of luck. \"No one is helping us anymore,\" Louissaint says, \"not even the parish priest.\"\n\n\"I left because of the threats,\" says Wayom, who has lived in a tent for more than a year. \"The bosses wanted us out.\" Photo by Mario Ariza\n\nEliseo Jean Luis isn't quite sure how old he is. A tall, rail-thin, gray-haired father of 11, he thinks he must be pushing 60. But because he was born in a rural part of the Dominican Republic to illiterate parents who were never issued a birth certificate, he can't be sure. Though he speaks fluent Spanish and can name more Dominican towns than Haitian ones, he doesn't plan to ever go back to the land of his birth. He has lived in dusty Parc Cadeau for a year and a half but would like to resettle deeper into Haiti. \"A thousand pesos could get me out of here,\" he says.\n\nJean Luis left his home because he was afraid. He and his wife walked across the border and into Haiti in early July 2015. They left behind a life growing beans in Las Mercedes, a hill town 13 miles from Pedernales. When he talks about his decision to return to Haiti, his voice drops to a hushed tone. \"The t\u00edgueres showed up one night in June. They were on motorcycles. They had machetes and pistols.\"\n\nJean Luis says they caught him on the road as he was walking back to his home. He thinks they didn't hurt him because he looks so old. But they insulted him and told him to return to his country, or else.\n\nHe says he felt like \"the t\u00edgueres from Pedernales wanted to burn us all, and the radio was saying it was going to be like 1937 all over again.\"\n\nHis voice lowers to a whisper when he mentions that far-off year. He's like many Haitians on the island, one of Columbus' first landing spots in the New World. He still shudders at the thought of the genocide perpetrated by American-backed dictator Rafael Leonidas Trujillo exactly 80 years ago.\n\nThe Spanish-speaking Dominican Republic and the mostly Kreyol-speaking Haiti share the island of Hispaniola, a landmass that's 700 miles from Miami and about the size of North Carolina. The island's 137-mile, mountainous border divides the Western Hemisphere's poorest nation from Latin America's fastest-growing economy.\n\nBecause the majority of both countries' populations are of African descent, the genocide perpetrated by Dominicans against Haitians can be difficult to understand for Americans, says Harvard professor Lorgia Garc\u00eda Pe\u00f1a. \"Early in the 16th Century, the Spaniards said, 'Fuck sugar \u2014 there's gold in Peru and native people we can exploit,' so they abandoned Hispaniola,\" she says. \"To be negro [\"black\" in Spanish] meant you were a slave, so even just one drop of white blood meant a better social position.\"\n\nThe French showed up early in the 18th Century and took the western side of the island. They quickly imported millions of slaves and turned the French colony of Saint-Domingue into the richest in the New World. The new influx of slaves meant that being something other than \"negro\" became much more important to the mixed-race Spaniards on the island's eastern side.\n\nThe French slaves heroically rebelled in 1791 and eventually conquered the whole island. Ultimately, Dominicans of all colors rose up against the Haitian occupation and gained independence in 1844.\n\n\"Dominican mulattos made the Republic possible,\" Garc\u00eda Pe\u00f1a clarifies, \"but then the white people took over.\"\n\nThe United States occupied Haiti in 1915 and the Dominican Republic in 1916 and helped a white elite to consolidate power in the latter. Along with building roads and providing sanitation, the United States brought institutionalized racism to the island and began importing Haitian labor to work in the Dominican Republic's sugarcane fields. Since then, Haitian labor has been integral to Dominican success.\n\n\"We feel like what the Dominican Republic is doing is equal to some type of apartheid in the Caribbean,\" says Marleine Bastien, director of Fanm Ayisyen nan Miyami, a community social services nonprofit based in Miami. She helped organize the Haitian diaspora's response to la apatrida. \"We went to Congress but got nowhere,\" Bastien remembers. \"We felt that [la apatrida] was very unfair. Haitians had built Dominican infrastructure and were now being kicked out.\"\n\nOne activist, the Pulitzer Prize-winning Dominican writer Junot D\u00edaz, testified before Congress alongside Haitian writer Edwidge Danticat about the civil genocide. The Dominican government responded by stripping D\u00edaz of a national prize he had been given in 2009. Authorities cited his \"un-Dominican activities.\"\n\nThough a law was passed in 2014 to allow Haitians to stay in the Dominican Republic and get access to social services, hundreds of thousands couldn't meet its stringent requirements. Among them: If one lacked proper documents, one would need testimony from two people who had been present at one's birth.\n\n\"Hypocritical\" is how Bastien describes it. \"The interior ministry knew the burden placed on families was too high.\"\n\nThe Dominican government claims that Louissaint, Jean Luis, and the other residents of Parc Cadeau left the country of their own accord \u2014 \"self-deported.\"\n\nIn a sense, they did. Filled with fear, some 4,000 people fled to Parc Cadeau. Today there are about 2,000 left. Though more than 230,000 Haitian migrants in the Dominican Republic have registered for new documents, a half-million haven't.\n\nRecently, deportations have slowed, mob assaults have been reported less often, and there has even been some humanitarian cooperation.\n\nBut all of this is far from the mind of Eliseo Jean Luis. His concerns are more immediate: clean water, cash for food, shelter from the dust and sun. Asked about his hope for the future, his face clouds over and his eyes narrow. In a voice choked with emotion, he says, \"Everything here is fucked.\"\n\nMackenz\u00f3n Augiste is tired of having to hike up a hill next to Parc Cadeau to defecate. A 27-year-old father of three who was born and raised across the border in the hills above Pedernales, he leans his gaunt, exhausted frame against the sill of his dilapidated hut's only window. Then he speaks in slow, measured, Kreyol-accented Spanish. \"I don't feel well here. There's nothing to eat. Sometimes I go days without eating, and I just got over being sick.\" His sickness shows. His skin is sallow, and he sounds defeated.\n\nAugiste was a cowherd for a Dominican farmer on the other side. With exhaustion, he notes that the camp's eight rudimentary latrines have filled up in the past year and a half. Residents are forced up into the hills or down to the river when they need to go to the bathroom. A similar situation is likely what led to last year's cholera outbreak. \"When it's dry, the wind kicks up the shit and the dust and makes us sick. When it rains, everything in my house gets soaked, and we get sick. I'm tired of it.\" Asked why he hasn't moved farther into Haiti, Mackenz\u00f3n says he doesn't know the country. He spent his whole life in the Dominican Republic, and on clear days, he stares out across the river toward his former home.\n\nCadeau means \"gift\" in Kreyol, which seems entirely ironic, especially as one approaches the camp on a motorbike, leaving the unfinished concrete houses of Anse-\u00e0-Pitres behind for the unforgiving, cactus-spiked scrubland of the south of Hispaniola. The settlement sits on a plain some four or five miles wide. From a hill above the camp, one can glimpse the shallow Pedernales River as it bends toward the Caribbean Sea. Across the road from the haphazard collection of slapdash houses and bare gray lots is a series of naked limestone cliffs that marks where the ocean, millions of years ago, used to be.\n\nAsked how he feels since moving, the former cowherd says, \"It's been a calamity.\" Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nMore shares recommend reddit email\n\n\n\nA farmer named it \"gift park\" because one of his cows birthed twin calves shortly after he purchased the land. Last winter, as if fulfilling the plot's name, that farmer's son let a few destitute souls squat here. That number grew and then fell as residents left to move deeper into Haiti or were resettled by international organizations.\n\nAccording to camp residents who did not wish to be identified, the International Organization for Migration (IOM), a nonprofit based in Switzerland, gave almost a thousand people money to rent homes in Anse-\u00e0-Pitres. But residents report that the organization hasn't helped enough of them, and they complain that after the rent money ran out, the people who had received aid returned because they couldn't find jobs.\n\nJuan Baca, the chief of mission for the IOM in the Dominican Republic, neither conformed nor denied the residents' allegations. He said he had no firsthand experience of the camp. But, he added, \"It's possible that many in the camps stayed because they were awaiting the possibility of receiving aid.\"\n\nPierre Paul Edouane is not just waiting for aid. In some ways, his life parallels that of Mackenz\u00f3n. He is also a 27-year-old resident of the camp who was born and raised across the border. A serious and thoughtful man who chooses his words carefully and could use a shave, he cares for the small makeshift chapel built of palm thatch that stands in the center of Parc Cadeau. He helps distribute what little aid arrives these days.\n\nInside the chapel, Edouane takes advantage of the shadowy coolness to explain why he and so many other residents have stayed in Parc Cadeau despite the precarious conditions.\n\n\"There were three kinds of people here last year: The first knew where they were from in Haiti and went back home. The second knew where they were from but didn't have a place to go in Haiti anymore. The third, like me, didn't know Haiti at all. The second and third have stayed.\"\n\nEdouane isn't even considering a return to the Dominican Republic to register. \"I don't have any papers, nor do I have money to go back.\" He tries not to feel defeated.\n\nHe's philosophical about his time spent in the Dominican Republic. \"Life over there was better, in the sense that you could eat, but here in Haiti, there is no harassment, no one attacks us.\" As he speaks, Edouane cradles a coconut. He explains it's from a small plot of Haitian land his father purchased with money earned during 37 years of sharecropping in the Dominican Republic.\n\nHe uses yield from the tiny half-acre plot to feed his wife and child. But he must share whatever the land produces with his father's seven other children. Edouane says he feels both Dominican and Haitian, even if he can't return to the country where he was born.\n\nNeither the Haitian government nor local politicians have done much to aid these Dominican-born Parc Cadeau residents. There is not much work to be found aside from the occasional cutting of a tree for charcoal. Nor is there counseling to help folks find jobs in tourism, agriculture, or other industries.\n\nAsked how he feels since moving to Parc Cadeau, Augiste, the former cowherd, says, \"It's been a calamity.\"\n\nFor Haitians who have stayed in the Dominican Republic, even registering kids for school is tough. Photo by Mario Ariza\n\nJean Marie Telemac is of Haitian lineage but is different in many ways from the residents of Parc Cadeau. The lean father of five with a sun-weathered face has lived in Las Mercedes, a hill town in the Dominican Republic about 20 miles from Parc Cadeau, since 1986.\n\nWhen the t\u00edgueres came to his town in June 2015, Telemac \u2014 with his hard-set jaw, steely eyes, and peasant stubbornness \u2014 didn't budge. \"I have a good relationship with my Dominican landlord,\" he explains while softly patting a sheathed machete attached to his belt. There are thousands like him who remained in the hills.\n\nHe has traveled to the town of Pedernales, 13 miles from his home, for an appointment at the civil registry the next morning. He has applied for the third time for documents so his two daughters can study in the Dominican Republic. \"I would like to see all my children studying,\" he says.\n\nTelemac is angling for the kind of card that one-third of the Haitian migrants in the Dominican Republic have received. But because his daughters were not issued birth certificates by Dominican authorities, \"it's going to be difficult,\" he says. \"Since they don't have documents, they can't get documents.\"\n\n\"I was raised there, had my kids there, but I would never go back.\" Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nMore shares recommend reddit email\n\n\n\nIn a phone interview, the IOM's Baca qualifies the new identity card program as a relative success. He claims few other countries \u2014 including the United States \u2014 offer immigrants access to social services like the Dominican Republic offers. \"It's true that when the deadline was coming, there was a lot of noise and fear in the Haitian community,\" he says. \"But there's been a sea change in the [Dominican] government attitude toward Haitian migration.\"\n\nSays Harvard's Garc\u00eda Pe\u00f1a: \"That's bullshit, and you can quote me on that... This is a racialized system of oppression and control. If the idea is to regularize, then why denationalize Dominicans of Haitian descent going back all the way to 1937?\"\n\nTelemac's struggles to register his children speak of the program's manifold failures. Authorities want statements from the mayor of Telemac's town and from the midwife who helped his wife deliver their children. The trips from his remote village to try to win approval, he says, are taxing his meager finances.\n\nLife without the card means restricted access to work, travel, and education. It also means constantly having to bribe the notoriously corrupt Dominican police every time they are encountered or risk getting thrown onto a bus and deported. Telemac says he's simply fighting for his children's fair share. He's frustrated by all the red tape but determined to get the documents.\n\nAnaluisa Jean, a thin 33-year-old mother of two who was born in the Dominican Republic, says that over the past year and a half, conditions in Parc Cadeau have deteriorated. Food has gotten scarcer. Doctors have stopped visiting. Fuel for cooking has become more expensive. And every month or two, someone's hut burns down because they got distracted while tending a fire.\n\nStill, Jean rejects the idea of returning to the Dominican Republic, even if the situation is bleak. \"I was raised there, had my kids there, but I would never go back.\" She says people in the town of Pedernales threw rocks at her children one morning in June 2015 as they were walking to school. Those people were her neighbors. She says the border police summarily deported friends and family members, and some of her relatives were even beaten.\n\nUnlike most other residents of Parc Cadeau, Jean lived just outside Pedernales, in a neighborhood slightly north of the town. Her old house sat directly across the river from the refugee camp, only a half-hour walk away. She says that in June 2015, \"things got so bad I couldn't even get to work. So we fled.\"\n\nShe and her children walked to Haiti one afternoon, crossing the shallow Pedernales River on foot. Though she is now free from the threat of persecution at the hands of vigilantes and Dominican border authorities, Jean is less than sanguine about her new life in Haiti. \"Here, there's no work. Here, we're surviving by the grace of God.\"",

Joe Stanavage, right, speaks with. Ingrid Martinez, left, translator, and Anderson Jimenez, master of ceremonies.\n\nOne hundred and seventy three years ago today, the Dominican Republic declared itself free from Haitian rule.\n\nTo celebrate the island nation\u2019s Independence Day, about two dozen people gathered Sunday at Memorial Park in Hazleton for a program organized by the Dominican House of Hazleton.\n\nPortions of the city\u2019s population can claim ties to the Caribbean country.\n\nAttendees waved Dominican flags and wore the colors of the nation.\n\nBlue signifies liberty; white is salvation and red stands for the blood of patriots who died in the battle 173 years ago.\n\nDominican House President Victor Perez recounted the history of the Dominican Republic, which was occupied at times by France, Spain and Haiti.\n\nHe honored Juan Pablo Duarte for organizing the war against the Haitian occupation, as well as founders Ramon Matias Mella, Francisco del Rosario Sanchez, Maria Trinidad Sanchez and Concepcion Bonn.\n\n\u201cYou and I are today are one of each of them. We assume our role not only as Dominicans but as the Latin Americans that we are, resisting the struggles of those who have ears and do not hear and eyes to see but do not want to see that this is a great nation of immigrants for which we are grateful,\u201d Perez said.\n\n\u201cWe are willing to give the best of us for this wonderful country and for our children that were born here,\u201d Perez said.\n\n\u201cToday we have to resist, resist and proclaim in high voices, \u2018Freedom, equality and justice for all and God bless America.\u2019\u201d\n\nMaximo Velez, president of the Dominican Liberation Party in Hazleton, also spoke about Duarte.\n\n\u201cHe was a man that gave everything for his country,\u201d Velez said.\n\nAccording to Velez, however, not many young people of Dominican descent know about Duarte or the country\u2019s history.\n\n\u201cThey have been losing their traditions,\u201d he said. \u201cThey can\u2019t answer any questions about the history. They are losing the story.\u201d\n\nHe encouraged attendees to never forget Duarte and the island nation\u2019s struggle for independence.\n\nGuillermo Lara, president of the Mexican Committee of Hazleton, said he has been celebrating the Dominican Independence Day for years even though he has no familial ties to the country.\n\n\u201cUnderstand that everybody together is stronger,\u201d he said.\n\nEarlier in the program, master of ceremonies Anderson Jimenez introduced the Rev. Ilda M. Martinez from the Pentecostal House of Prayer, who offered a blessing.\n\nThe celebration also brought Hazleton councilmen Jack Mundie and Dave Sosar. They were joined by Democratic candidate for city council, Nicarol Soto.\n\nMotorists traveling along Church Street slowed to watch the ceremony and some honked horns in a show of support.\n\nToward the ceremony\u2019s end, the group sang the national anthems of both the United States and the Dominican Republic. They held their hands to their hearts as they watched the Dominican flag flying beneath the stars and stripes.\n\njwhalen@standardspeaker.com",

Haffey/Getty Images\n\nWhile the Miami Dolphins reportedly want to re-sign wide receiver Kenny Stills, a new report suggests he is leaning toward signing elsewhere in free agency.\n\nAccording to Armando Salguero of the Miami Herald, the Dolphins are hoping to make a pitch to Stills this week, but sources believe he is more likely to test the free-agent waters.\n\nPer Salguero, Stills is expected to command around $12 million per season on the open market, a price Miami is unwilling to pay.\n\nA receiver-needy team such as the Philadelphia Eagles may be in the hunt, however; Eliot Shorr-Parks of NJ.com reported their interest in Stills, and Salguero confirmed it.\n\nThe 24-year-old Stills is coming off arguably his best season, as he reeled in 42 receptions for 726 yards and a career-high nine touchdowns.\n\nMiami acquired him from the New Orleans Saints prior to the 2015 season, and while Stills' first campaign with the Dolphins was a struggle to the tune of just 440 yards and three touchdowns, he became a key part of the offense in 2016.\n\nStills is a good fit in Miami since he is among the NFL's most dangerous deep threats, which allows Pro Bowl receiver Jarvis Landry to do damage underneath defenses.\n\nThe 2013 fifth-round pick out of Oklahoma was only third on the team in receiving yardage last season, though, behind both Landry and DeVante Parker.\n\nIf Parker continues to make strides and Miami manages to find a cheaper deep option either through the draft or free agency, it may be able to let Stills walk without experiencing too much of a drop-off.", 
        "body2": "Retaining wide receiver Kenny Stills is the Miami Dolphins\u2019 primary offseason goal, or so they say.\n\nBut the pending free agent is not guaranteed to return next season, with teams inevitably scouting for deep field threats, as a Friday report has already noted.\n\nStills\u2019 market value has been estimated at anywhere from $25 million to $30 million over a four- or five-year contract, according to Spotrac and other sources. Theoretically, those are numbers the Dolphins could find reasonable, but if another team comes forward with a larger offer, he\u2019s likely to accept it.\n\nWhat would that mean for the Dolphins\u2019 passing offense?\n\nIt wouldn\u2019t be good. Stills was Miami\u2019s third most productive pass catcher, covering 726 yards through the air, and was their most prolific scorer, with nine receiving touchdowns. His 17.3 yards on average per catch was not only a team-high, but the NFL\u2019s third best mark overall, surpassed only by four-tenths of a yard behind DeSean Jackson and Chris Hogan.\n\nSurveying the Dolphins\u2019 receiving depth chart reveals enviable talent, but Stills\u2019 most pronounced skill, the long play that can split a secondary in two, is not prominent among the other members: Jarvis Landry is a yards after the catch fixture from the slot, but not known as a high-volume scorer; DeVante Parker can be special, and was their second-best yard gainer, but he was also slowed by injuries to his hamstring and back last summer.\n\nOtherwise, Miami relies on unproven rookie Leonte Carroo, and a decent cadre of tight ends and assorted tailbacks to provide an extra push as pass receivers.\n\nLosing Stills is obviously not an ideal solution, and it\u2019s one the Dolphins are currently formulating plans to avoid. And though there would be a few options to consider in the draft, the team would do better to use their picks to address other, more pressing needs, and stick with the player they know has proven success.", 
        "body1": "Which wide receiver should the Eagles sign in 2017 NFL free agency: DeSean Jackson or Kenny Stills?\n\nAs the Philadelphia Eagles are gearing up for the 2017 free agency period, which begins on March 9 at 9 p.m. ET (tampering period starts March 7), there is a big debate for many fans and analysts. Should the Eagles should target wide receiver DeSean Jackson over wide receiver Kenny Stills, or should they target Stills over Jackson?\n\nWithout football being on, the debate has helped filled a void that many are missing, but in my opinion, that is all this is\u2014just a football debate to fill a void. I feel that targeting Jackson over Stills is a no-brainer. Let\u2019s start debunking the theory that the Eagles need to target Stills over Jackson.\n\nStills is entering his fifth year in the NFL and has never had 1,000 or more yards in a season. His highest total (913) came in 2014 with the New Orleans Saints, who traded Stills before the 2015 season for a third-round pick to the Miami Dolphins. That mean if Stills signs with someone other than the Saints or the Dolphins, he will play for three teams in five years. You have to assume that, if Stills was an elite talent or teams saw elite potential in his game, he would not be in this scenario.\n\nStaying on Stills, he has never caught more than 50 passes in a season and outside of that 2014 seasons when he caught 63 passes, Stills\u2019 next highest total was 42 receptions. The former Dolphin\u2019s longest touchdown of his career was 76 yards. So why are Eagles fans and analysts thinking Stills is the guy the Eagles should target instead of Jackson?\n\nHis career yards per reception is impressive, sitting at 16.7 and he is coming off of a career-high nine-touchdown season in 2016. Stills averaged 17.3 yards per reception and was a solid deep threat for the Dolphins this past season. However, those aren\u2019t the numbers that people put the most weight into. At just 24 years old, though, the thought is that the young player is getting ready to hit his prime and have a breakout season.\n\nThe argument is that the 30-year-old Jackson will start to decline while the 24-year-old Stills will start to rise. It makes sense\u2014if this were a video game. In a perfect world, the younger player will start to perform better than the older player, but you need grounds and factual evidence to support the claim that Stills will be a better asset than Jackson. However, the numbers and facts just aren\u2019t there.\n\nJackson has played nine NFL seasons and has gone over 1,000 yards five times. That means Stills will need to go over 1,000 yards, something he has never done, for the next four seasons to match Jackson. He has also caught over 50 passes six times in his career, and did so in three out of his first four seasons in the NFL, grabbing 47 in the year he failed to reach that mark.\n\nHearing this, people will say that was over Jackson\u2019s career, but now it is about the present and the future. Well, last season Jackson caught 52 passes for 1,005 yards and four scores. He did that in 15 games, one less than Stills, and he averaged 17.9 yards per catch, best in the NFL. So, in present time, Jackson remains better than Stills.\n\nIn the last four seasons, the first four seasons for Stills (2013-16), Jackson has more receptions, yards, and touchdowns than Stills. He also averages more yards per reception than Stills and has an impressive 19 yards per receptions rate over his last three years.\n\nSaying the Eagles should target Stills over Jackson sounds good, but the facts prove otherwise. Outside of age, why would the Eagles want Stills over Jackson? Even if Jackson slows down in two or three years, those are two or three years of elite play by a guy who will be in the Hall of Fame when he\u2019s done playing.\n\nBy signing Jackson over Stills, the Eagles get a sure-fire deep threat and someone who will stretch the field for their offense. It gives their franchise quarterback Carson Wentz a veteran target that he can trust. Signing Stills does the complete opposite. It guarantees nothing and, if Stills does what he has been doing so far in his career, Wentz would have another mediocre wide receiver that he can\u2019t depend on.\n\nIf the future is what many people are putting weight on, the arrow still points to Jackson being the better option over Stills. The numbers and facts don\u2019t lie, and Jackson is the wide receiver the Eagles should target when free agency opens, not Stills.",

        "body0": "- St. Anthony Police Officer Jeronimo Yanez pleaded not guilty Monday morning to manslaughter in the July shooting death of Philando Castile. The trial date is set for May 30.\n\nRamsey County District Court Judge William Leary III recently denied a defense request to dismiss the case.\n\nYanez shot Castile, 32, at a traffic stop on July 6 in Falcon Heights, Minnesota. During the stop, Castile told the officer he was armed. The aftermath of the fatal shooting was broadcast on Facebook Live by his girlfriend, Diamond Reynolds, who was a passenger in Castile\u2019s vehicle. In the video stream, Reynolds says they were pulled over for a broken tail light.\n\nRamsey County Attorney John Choi reviewed the case and concluded the use of deadly force during the July traffic stop was not justified.\n\nAccording to the criminal complaint: \u201cYanez communicated his intent to pull over Castile\u2019s vehicle by radio to St. Anthony Police Officer Joseph Kauser who was on patrol nearby. Yanez told Kauser that he had reason to pull the vehicle over and that the occupants \u2018just look like the people that were involved in a robbery.\u2019 Yanez further stated that \u2018the driver looks more like one of our suspects just because of the wide set nose.\u2019 Yanez noted that he also had reason to stop the vehicle because it had a non-working brake light. Yanez followed Castile\u2019s vehicle, waiting until Kauser arrived as backup.\u201d\n\nThe attorneys representing Yanez argue that the officer feared for his life and had no choice but to shoot Castile. They also say Castile disobeyed orders and was \"stoned.\"",

Attorneys for Yanez state he will plead not guilty to manslaughter and other counts in the shooting. They say their client had no choice but to shoot Castile after claiming he saw a gun. However, officials later learned that the 32-year-old Black man had a permit to carry a weapon and prosecutors raised questions as to whether Yanez actually saw a firearm.\n\nJudge Leary, who was assigned to the case after defense attorneys requested a new one, replaced Judge Edward Wilson.

        "body1": "The case against a St. Anthony police officer who fatally shot Philando Castile during a traffic stop this past summer is heading to trial.\n\nIn an order issued Wednesday afternoon, Ramsey County District Judge William Leary denied a defense motion to have the charges against Jeromino Yanez dismissed on the grounds they lacked probable cause.\n\nDefense attorneys also argued that Castile was high on marijuana when Yanez shot him, making the 32-year-old black man culpable in his own death.\n\nLeary found that prosecutors had met the legal threshold necessary to move forward.\n\n\u201cThis court concludes that the evidence, as interpreted by the state, is substantial enough to create a likelihood that, if the state\u2019s interpretation is accepted by a jury, the state could prevail,\u201d the order reads. \u201cConsequently\u2026 it is fair and reasonable to allow this matter to proceed to trial.\u201d\n\nLeary went on to write that the defense\u2019s argument that Castile was somehow to blame for his death because he was high had \u201cfailed.\u201d\n\n\u201cA victim\u2019s unreasonable conduct is never an absolute defense to a criminal charge,\u201d the order said.\n\nThe judge issued his decision hours after a Wednesday morning hearing on the motion drew supporters for both Castile and Yanez to the Ramsey County Courthouse.\n\nLeary gave defense attorney Paul Engh the first opportunity to present reasons for asking for the dismissal during the proceeding. Assistant U.S. Attorney Jeffrey Paulsen countered with arguments on why the case should go to trial.\n\nChief among the defense\u2019s position, Engh argued, was that the charges lacked probable cause because Yanez had acted within the rights afforded him as a police officer when he made the decision to fire at Castile July 6.\n\nAs a police officer, Engh said Yanez had the right to be carrying a gun that night, the right to stop Castile for his vehicle\u2019s broken tail light, the right to have his orders obeyed, and the right to shoot when he felt his life was in danger.\n\nThe defense further argued that Castile was high at the time and therefore had no right to be driving a vehicle or carrying a gun. His impairment made him culpable in his death, Engh argued.\n\nRelated Articles St. Anthony officer pleads not guilty in Castile shooting\n\nPlan to attend the Philando Castile cop shooting trial?

Instead he was reaching for his wallet to comply with Yanez\u2019s request to see his driver\u2019s license, he argued.\n\nFurther, he disputed the claim that Yanez actually saw Castile\u2019s gun, pointing out that when first interviewed after the shooting, Yanez reportedly said, \u201cI don\u2019t know where the gun was.\u201d\n\nHe also said that, while Castile was found to have had THC \u2014 an active ingredient in marijuana \u2014 in his system at the time of his death, Castile was not \u201cimpaired\u201d at the time of the traffic stop. He added that video captured of the incident backs that up.\n\nHe also argued against the defense\u2019s claim that Castile\u2019s use of marijuana could somehow negate his right not to be recklessly shot by a police officer.\n\n\u201cThe central question in this case\u2026 is not whether (Castile) had a right to carry a gun \u2026 it was his right not to be killed for no good reason,\u201d Paulsen said.\n\nHe added that Yanez\u2019s subjective opinion that he faced a threat to his life was not an adequate defense. Instead, he said the legal standard is based on the \u201cobjective\u201d assessment of what a \u201creasonable officer\u201d would do under the same circumstances.\n\n\u201cIf all (a police officer) had to do is say, \u2018I felt threatened and you have to believe me, Judge,\u2019 there would never be a prosecution (in these cases.) \u2026 That\u2019s what a trial is for,\u201d Paulsen said.\n\nThe St. Anthony police officer was charged in November with one count of second-degree manslaughter and two felony counts of dangerous discharge of a firearm for fatally shooting Castile during a July 6, 2016, traffic stop in Falcon Heights. Castile was in the car at the time with his girlfriend and her young child.\n\nYanez wore a beige suit at the hearing. Sitting next to his team of attorneys, he said nothing during the roughly 40-minute proceeding.\n\nEarl Gray, another of Yanez\u2019s defense attorneys, said that while the defense had hoped to win its motion Wednesday, he was still confident Yanez would prevail at trial.\n\n\u201cBefore you can be convicted, a jury has to find unanimously that your client is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt,\u201d Gray said. \u201cWell, I believe that when we present the (findings) about Castile\u2019s conduct that night compared with our client\u2019s, I don\u2019t think it will take a jury long to find that the state has failed miserably to prove their case beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d\n\nSome of Yanez\u2019s fellow officers, including the St. Anthony police chief, attended the Wednesday hearing.\n\nCastile\u2019s family and friends took up two rows inside the courtroom.\n\nHis mother, Valerie Castile, said afterword that the future of the case is \u201cin God\u2019s hands,\u201d and reiterated the integrity of her son and the depth of loss she and her loved ones have had to carry since his death.\n\n\u201cHe was an amazing human being,\u201d she said.\n\nCastile graduated from Central High School in 2001. He was a longtime employee for the St. Paul school district, where he worked in an elementary school as a kitchen supervisor. He had never been convicted of a felony in Minnesota.\n\nYanez, who is Latino, is married with one child. The 28-year-old became a licensed police officer in 2011 and joined the St. Anthony Police Department about four years ago.\n\nHe has no record of complaints against him in his personnel file.\n\nThe next hearing in the case is scheduled for Feb. 27.

We are currently investigating how this could have happened, and deeply regret that this occurred.\n\n'We appreciate the grace with which the nominees, the Academy, ABC, and Jimmy Kimmel handled the situation.'\n\nIn a heart-stopping moment, the stars and producers of La La Land were stopped midway through their acceptance speeches and forced to hand their trophies to the stars of Moonlight after their film was announced as Best Picture in one of the biggest blunders in Oscar history.\n\nWarren Beatty was forced to explain the mishap as the cast of La La Land handed over their Oscars to the producers of Moonlight on stage\n\nThe horror, the horror: The stunned crowd looks on as it was revealed the wrong name had been read. Matt Damon's (left of center row) jaw literally dropped when he heard the news, while Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson (right) looked almost angry at what was happening. Ben Affleck (front right) had his head turned towards where the Moonlight team was sitting, while legendary actor Meryl Streep (bottom right) was leaning forward in her chair with a stupefied look on her face\n\nThe terrible end to an otherwise triumphant show left the audience gasping in horror as Beatty revealed he had incorrectly read La La Land as the winner.\n\nAccountancy firm PricewaterhouseCoopers's Brian Cullinan and Martha Ruiz were in charge of this year's top-secret Academy Awards results. They're posed together above with the two sets of envelopes, which are carried in briefcases\n\nAs the La La Land cast were walking on stage to accept the accolade, a stagehand standing in the wings could be heard saying 'Oh ... Oh my god, he got the wrong envelope' and walking back and forth, according to the LA Times.\n\nWhile still on stage, Beatty blamed the epic mishap on being given the wrong envelope, saying he had seen the name Emma Stone from 'La La Land' when he opened his envelope.\n\n'I want to tell you what happened I opened the envelope and it said Emma Stone, La La Land and that is why I took such a long look at Faye and at you.

This is Moonlight for best picture,' Beatty told the shocked crowd as he explained the blunder.\n\nAn investigation is continuing into how La La Land was wrongly named Best Picture rather than the triumphant Moonlight.\n\nOnly two people know the Oscars winners list and supervise the counting procedures - PwC tax adviser Martha Ruiz and Brian Cullinan an accountant who is the chairman of PwC's US board.\n\nJust days before the showcase event, they told the Huffington Post that they were unsure of the exact procedure in the event that the wrong actor or film was named as a winner in any given category since such a mistake had never been made in the awards' 88-year history.\n\nCullinan and Ruiz each carry a suitcase containing a copy of the winning envelope for all the categories - meaning there are two envelopes for each award.\n\nThere are duplicate envelopes for every category and Beatty was given the Best Actress duplicate envelope for best actress- with the category ACTRESS IN A LEADING ROLE clearly printed on the outside\n\nLa La Land producer Jordan Horowitz held up the correct envelope with Moonlight written on it as Warren Beatty stood behind him, before he graciously passed his statue to the Moonlight producers\n\nThe pair stand on opposite sides backstage and memorize the winners to avoid having to write them down and have revealed in the past how they carry out rigorous checks to ensure they have stuffed the envelopes correctly.\n\nIt is believed Ruiz and Cullinan are ordered to destroy the duplicate cards as the presentation goes on, so by the time Best Picture is awarded, the only envelopes left are the two for Best Picture, according to Free Press.\n\nWhen Beatty and Dunaway took the stage to announce the Best Picture award, Cullinan and Ruiz realized that they still had two best picture envelopes, meaning that the envelope taken on stage was a duplicate for an award that had already been announced.\n\nIt is unknown why there was still a Best Actress duplicate available when Beatty walked on stage.\n\nExecutives from PwC immediately realized there was a problem, but they were too late to rectify the mistake as Dunaway read out the name La La Land from a card that was meant to be for the Best Actress award, which Emma Stone won for her role in the film earlier in the night.\n\nAfter the officials realized what had happened, they tried to get on stage immediately.

Social media users immediately took to Twitter to criticize the 89th Academy Awards and announcers with hilarious memes of Steve Harvey, and some even called for Beatty to announce the 'real' 2016 election results. Beatty blamed the epic mishap on being given the wrong envelope, saying he had seen the name Emma Stone from La La Land when he opened his envelope. 'I want to tell you what happened I opened the envelope and it said Emma Stone, La La Land and that is why I took such a long look at Faye and at you. I wasn't trying to be funny. This is Moonlight for best picture,' Beatty told the shocked crowd as he explained the blunder. And Twitter ruthlessly criticized the awards show with hilarious memes of Steve Harvey, and some even called for Beatty to announce the 'real' 2016 election results It has since emerged that there are back up envelopes for every category and Beatty was given the Emma Stone back up envelope by mistake. Executives from Price Waterhouse who tally the Oscar results immediately realized there was a problem when Dunaway read out the name La La Land. An official tried to get on stage to immediately rectify the mistake. Just seconds before, confusion was etched across Beatty's face after he opened the envelope. He took a second glance inside the winner's envelope before handing it over to Dunaway who read out La La Land. Host Jimmy Kimmel came forward to inform the cast that Moonlight had indeed won, showing the inside of the envelope as proof. La La Land producer Jordan Horwitz immediately called up the producers of Moonlight and graciously passed his statue over. 'I knew I would screw this up,' Kimmel, a first-time host, joked. 'I promise to never come back.' Moonlight's director Barry Jenkins said: 'Very clearly even in my dreams this cant be true. But to hell with it because this is true. It's true, it's not fake.' The fiasco triggered the remembrance of a similar incident that took place in 2015 when comedian and host Steve Harvey announced the wrong winner of Miss Universe. Harvey announced that Miss Colombia, Ariadna Gutierrez, was the winner of the pageant over actual victor Miss Philippines, Pia Wurtzbach.\n\nThis is the first time in Oscar history that the wrong envelope had been opened while an award was being announced.\n\nHost Jimmy Kimmel came forward to inform the cast that Moonlight had indeed won, showing the inside of the envelope as proof.\n\nLa La Land producer Jordan Horowitz immediately called up the producers of Moonlight and graciously passed his statue over.\n\n'I knew I would screw this up,' Kimmel, a first-time host, joked.

'I wanted to see the card... and Warren refused to show the card to anybody before he showed it to me. And so he did. He came upstairs and he walked over to me, and he showed the card.\n\n'Everyone was asking, 'Can I see the card?' And he was like, 'No, Barry Jenkins has to see the card, I need him to know'.

Oscars host Jimmy Kimmel kicked things off when he fired several shots at Trump during his opening monologue. But as the night progressed, actors, directors and designers quickly started dedicating their Academy Awards to 'the immigrants', spoke out against the Mexican wall and went as far as calling Trump's immigration policy 'inhumane'. While Alessandro Bertolazzi is not a well known name outside the film industry, the makeup artist was the first Oscar winner to mention politics in his acceptance speech. The Italian dedicated his win in the makeup and hair-styling category to 'all the immigrants'. Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway, stars of 1967's classic Bonnie and Clyde, presented the Oscar for best picture. 'Our goal in politics is the same in our goal in art, and that's to get to the truth,' Beatty said on stage. Iranian director Asghar Farhadi took home the Academy Award for best foreign film for his drama The Salesman. The director had previously said he was not attending the Oscars in revolt against Trump's immigration ban and it was accepted on his behalf by Iranian astronaut Anousheh Ansari. Mexican actor Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal also weighed in as he presented an award saying he did not support the wall Trump was proposing. Moonlight director Barry Jenkins said in accepting the Oscar for adapted screenplay that people who don't feel like they have support can look to the American Civil Liberties Union and artists over the next four years.\n\nThe late-night host first poked fun at Trump during his opening monologue saying the Academy Awards were being watching across the globe 'in more than 225 countries that now hate us'.\n\n'I want to say thank you to President Trump... remember last year when it seemed the Oscars were racist?' Kimmel told the star-studded audience. 'That's gone, thanks to him.'\n\nHe then took to the president's favorite medium - Twitter - to write: 'Hey @realDonaldTrump u up?' and '@realDonaldTrump #Merylsayshi.'\n\nAfter the comments about racism in his monologue, Kimmel was serious for a moment when he addressed how divided the country was. He said everyone could make America great again if people reached out to someone they disagreed with to have a positive conversation.\n\nBut that moment quickly passed as he began roasting Trump again.\n\nHe later called on the crowd to give a 'highly overrated' Meryl Streep a standing ovation for her 20 Oscar nominations throughout her career.\n\n'One actress has stood the test of time for her many uninspiring and overrated performances,' Kimmel said. 'This is Meryl's 20th Oscar nomination... she wasn't even in a movie this year, we just wrote her name in out of habit.'\n\nHe riffed off the president's post-Globes tweet calling Streep 'overrated' after her anti-Trump speech at the Golden Globes overshadowed that show's awards last month.\n\n'Nice dress by the way... Is that an Ivanka?' Kimmel asked Streep.\n\nKimmel joked that Trump would tweet about all of the Oscar winner's acceptance speeches 'in all caps during his 5am bowel movement tomorrow'.\n\nHost with the most: Then came out host Jimmy Kimmel and starts immediately joking about the state of the US\n\nRival: He even talked about burying the hatchet with Matt Damon\n\nBraveheart: The 49-year-old host poked fun at Mel Gibson\n\nAir mail: One of the funniest moments came when Kimmel had bags of candy parachuting from the roof of the building\n\nYum: Casey Affleck was one of the celebs who were excited to receive a sweet treat\n\nHilarious: At one point Jimmy brought in an entire tour bus of tourists into the auditorium for a surprise\n\nLiving it up: One of the special guests gave Nicole Kidman a kiss on the hand\n\nTrolling: At one point in the night Jimmy decided to tweet at President Donald Trump directly\n\n'You look familiar': Fifty Shades stars Jamie Dornan and Dakota Johnson presented together\n\nDynamic duo: Michael J.

        "body1": "Transition\n\nStates\u2019 rights used to be a conservative value. In the Trump age, it\u2019s a liberal one.\n\nIt\u2019s widely known that the Trump administration has overturned Obama-era protections for transgender students. It\u2019s less well known that the way it did so, emphasizing states\u2019 rights, was a gigantic tactical mistake that is going to blow up in their faces.\n\nThe substantive issue is whether transgender students in public schools should be allowed to use gender-appropriate restrooms, or whether schools may require them to use single-stall bathrooms or those corresponding to the students\u2019 biological sex at birth.\n\nLegally speaking, there are two avenues in which this debate is moving forward. First are two \u201cguidance letters\u201d by the Education Department, stating that Title IX\u2014which prohibits discrimination in educational contexts based on sex\u2014covers trans students as well, and requires schools to let them use gender-appropriate restrooms. That letter didn\u2019t have the force of law, but because the DoE could withhold funds from non-conforming school districts, it did wield the power of the purse-strings.\n\nThose letters were officially retracted in a February 22 letter by the civil rights directors of the Education and Justice Departments.\n\nBut there\u2019s also the second legal avenue, which is a case brought by the ACLU on behalf of Gavin Grimm, a transgender student in Virginia\u2014a case that will be argued at the Supreme Court on March 28. In that case, G.G. v. Gloucester County School Board, the Court is set to decide the same question: whether Title IX covers trans people.\n\nIn that regard, the February 22 letter is extremely odd. It doesn\u2019t take a position on Title IX, instead saying that the government needs more time to \u201cfurther and more completely consider the legal issues involved.\u201d And it adds, echoing President Trump\u2019s statements, that \u201cthere must be due regard for the primary role of the States and local school districts in establishing educational policy.\u201d\n\nThat was a huge mistake, for three reasons.\n\nFirst, the administration missed the opportunity to tell the Supreme Court its interpretation of Title IX. Earlier in the litigation, courts had deferred to the Obama administration\u2019s interpretation. But with that gone, the Supreme Court now has\u2026. nothing.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t really know the government\u2019s position on Title IX,\u201d said Joshua Block, the ACLU\u2019s lead lawyer, in a press call discussing the G.G. case. \u201cTechnically, their position is neutral.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s exactly right. And while the new government\u2019s position isn\u2019t technically part of the G.G. litigation, its February 22 letter practically begs the Court to weigh in.\n\nIt wouldn\u2019t have been hard to simply take the opposite view. True, the new administration has only been in office a month, but that\u2019s certainly not stopped them from taking bold positions on immigration, national security, and a myriad of other issues. Moreover, they\u2019re not working on a blank slate. Conservatives (and one district court) have articulated anti-trans interpretations of Title IX for years.\n\nHere, I\u2019ll articulate one right now: Title IX is about sex discrimination, and was passed in 1972. The term \u201ctransgender\u201d wasn\u2019t invented until 1975, and there\u2019s not a scintilla of evidence that Congress had anything like it in mind. Anyway, sex and gender are different things. This is a massive expansion of legislation that is totally unjustified by the statute or its legislative history.\n\nThat wasn\u2019t hard to say\u2014and yet the Trump administration chose not to say it, abdicating legal ground that it could easily have occupied.\n\nSecond, emphasizing states\u2019 rights is incoherent. Said Block, \u201csex discrimination in public schools hasn\u2019t been left up to the states since 1972. That\u2019s why Title IX was passed. The federal government said that it is going to protect everyone no matter what state they live in.\u201d\n\nThat, too, is exactly right. Like it or not, the whole point of federal legislation on civil rights is to take primacy over states\u2019 rights. That, unlike the question of transgender equality, is in the statutory history of Title IX, and it\u2019s absurd to argue \u201cstates\u2019 rights\u201d against a law that understands states\u2019 rights quite clearly, and deliberately takes precedence over them.\n\nGet The Beast In Your Inbox!

For two centuries\u2014during the Civil War, the New Deal, the Civil Rights movement, and in countless contemporary contexts from environmental law to interstate commerce\u2014conservatives have waved the banner of states\u2019 rights, while liberals have opposed them. It\u2019s in conservatives\u2019 DNA. It\u2019s why the conservative legal network is called \u201cThe Federalist Society.\u201d It\u2019s why Governor George Wallace stood in that schoolhouse door, opposing a federal desegregation order.\n\nBut now, the shoe is on the other foot. Now it\u2019s progressive states and localities arguing states\u2019 rights, and the federal government opposing them. The case that halted Trump\u2019s travel ban was called Washington v. Trump and was filed by the state of Washington against the federal government. \u2018Sanctuary cities\u2019 rely on the longstanding priority given to local authorities for local law enforcement. (The term is really a misnomer, since generally, it only means that local officials won\u2019t cooperate with federal immigration actions\u2014not that they will oppose them.) We\u2019re sure to see much more of this, particularly from blue states and cities.\n\nAttorney General Jeff Sessions, who spearhead the effort to overturn the transgender protections, is from a generation for whom states\u2019 rights and conservative resistance to civil rights were synonymous. But now, states\u2019 rights are more about liberal resistance to the Trump administration. The same values that his department\u2019s letter is promoting are opposed by the administration itself.",

Ringling Bros. ticket sales have been declining, but following the transition of the elephants off the road, we saw an even more dramatic drop. This, coupled with high operating costs, made the circus an unsustainable business for the company.\n\nNearly 50 years ago, my father founded our company with the acquisition of Ringling Bros. The circus and its people have continually been a source of inspiration and joy to my family and me, which is why this was such a tough business decision to make. The decision was even more difficult because of the amazing fans that have become part of our extended circus family over the years, and we are extremely grateful to the millions of families who have made Ringling Bros. part of their lives for generations. We know Ringling Bros. isn\u2019t only our family business, but also your family tradition.\n\nRingling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey\u00ae Presents Circus XTREME will conclude its tour at the Dunkin\u2019 Donuts Center in Providence, R.I., on May 7, 2017, and Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey\u00ae Presents Out Of This World will conclude its tour at the Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum in Uniondale, N.Y., on May 21, 2017. We hope you will come to celebrate this American icon for one last time before our tours conclude.\u201d\n\nHard as it is to believe, the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey\u00ae Circus is soon to disappear.\n\nIf you\u2019re a long-time fan or if you have children who have never experienced the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey\u00ae Circus, this is your last opportunity \u2013 snooze you lose.\n\nThe circus invites visitors to get ready to blast off on an intergalactic adventure for space-age family fun as the ultimate circus experience launches into the future with Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey\u00ae Presents \u201cOut Of This World.\u201d Audiences will take the helm to join the Circus Space Fleet on a heroic quest of good versus evil that will let imaginations run wild with unexpected surprises and thrills at every turn.\n\nThrough the lens of a magic telescope, \u201cOut Of This World\u201d transports audience members on an unforgettable journey as the circus Star Seeker battles to bring the most spectacular and talented performers back to Earth after years in outer space.\n\nThe lavish spectacle features gravity-defying acrobats, orbital aerialists, majestic animals, fearless daredevils and humorous clowns.\n\nVideo link for Ringling Bros. Circus \u2014 https://youtu.be/RJCI5ZXbmEo\n\nRingling\u2019s \u201cOut of This World\u201d will run from February 16- 20 at the Wells Fargo Center. Ticket prices range from $15-$105.\n\nWhile the death knell looms above the Wells Fargo Center on February 16, the ominous sounds of black metal will be filling the air at the Theatre of the Living Arts (334 South Street, Philadelphia, 215-222-1011, http://www.lnphilly.com) when the venue hosts a twin bill featuring Black Anvil and Mayhem.\n\nMayhem, a black metal band from Norway, will be performing its performing its \u201cDe Mysteriis Dom Sathanas\u201d album in its entirety. Black Anvil, a black metal band from New York, will be introducing songs from its \u201cAs Was\u201d album, which was just released in January on Relapse Records.\n\nThe band features: Paul Delaney \u2013 Bass guitar, vocals (2007\u2013present); Raeph Glicken \u2013 Drums, vocals (2007\u2013present); Travis Bacon \u2013 Electric guitar, vocals (2016-present); and Jeremy Sosville \u2013 Electric guitar, vocals (2012\u2013present).\n\nFormed in 2007 in New York City, Black Anvil released its debut album \u201cTime Insults the Mind\u201d in September 2009 followed by \u201cTriumvirate\u201d in 2010 and \u201cHail Death\u201d in 2014.\n\n\u201cAs Was\u201d is an album that is atmospheric and melodic without relenting on any of the ferocity the band is known for. It is more diverse, complex, and thought-provoking than anything the group has previously recorded.\n\n\u201cWe started working on the album a little over a year ago,\u201d said Delaney, during a phone interview Wednesday afternoon from a tour stop in Washington, D.C.\n\n\u201cWe recorded at Menegroth in Queens and it was mixed and mastered in Sweden by Tore Stjerna at Necromorbus Studio in Stockholm. He\u2019s just someone we knew would make the album sound like we wanted. We just left it in his hands.\n\n\u201cWe did some overdubbing when we were recording. You do as much as you can live and then add whatever else it needs. This was the first time we used this studio and we were very happy with it.\u201d\n\nDelaney spoke of the differences the new album has from its predecessors.\n\n\u201cThis album is a lot more refined,\u201d said Delaney. \u201cIt came together differently. We just sort of trimmed the fat and made it come together. We knew where we wanted to go. We wanted to keep it a lot simpler and, at the same time, more musical. We wanted to be more creative and take more chances. And, there is a lot more singing on it.\n\n\u201cWe did what we wanted and if some fans don\u2019t like the direction we moved, the hell with them. At the end of the day, we\u2019re happy with it. It was a huge success.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re at the end of this tour and then we\u2019ll start again soon. We\u2019ll be touring most of the year. This whole cycle we\u2019ll be playing new stuff and that\u2019s fine. I can\u2019t say we\u2019re a band that has hits or other sings that we must play.\u201d\n\nVideo link for Black Anvil \u2013 https://youtu.be/Md7r0qu51KM.\n\nThe show at the TLA will start at 8 p.m. Tickets are $25.\n\nOn February 16 in Philly, there will be a show with an entirely different vibe altogether at the World Caf\u00e9 Live (3025 Walnut Street, Philadelphia, 215-222-1400, www.worldcafelive.com) featuring Reed Mathis & Electric Beethoven.\n\nReed Mathis & Electric Beethoven are out on a limited-run East Coast tour performing a series of \u201cResonance Field Tests.\u201d\n\nThe idea behind the \u201ctests\u201d (presented in the form of dance concerts) stems from the growing theory that Ludwig van Beethoven\u2019s symphonies were encoded with eternal, healing, transcendent melodies meant to be reborn generation after generation, across both genre and cultural lines, as opposed to being stagnant museum pieces preserved lifelessly behind glass in seated and stuffy institutions.\n\nReed Mathis & Electric Beethoven are taking this music back to the streets, performing ritualistic dance ceremonies with an emphasis on improvisation and groove exploration. This allows Beethoven\u2019s music to come alive again \u2013 on dance floors rather than in symphony halls.\n\nUnder Mathis\u2019 leadership, the current Electric Beethoven \u2013 which is billed as the \u201cworld\u2019s first CDM (\u201cclassical dance music\u201d) band \u2014 features Jay Lane (Primus / Ratdog / Golden Gate Wingmen) on drums, Todd Stoops (RAQ, Rhythmatronix) on keys, and Clay Welch on guitar.\n\nMathis\u2019 solo but star-studded double-album, \u201cBeathoven,\u201d (Royal Potato Family, Sept. 2015) features an impressive list of guests (including Page McConnell, Mike Gordon, Joe Russo, Marco Benevento, Robert Walter, Stanton Moore, Mike Dillon, and the Barr Brothers) supporting Mathis in a series of trios as they navigate their way through entire performances of Beethoven\u2019s Symphony No. 3 and No. 6. \u201cBeathoven\u201d will be available on vinyl and compact disc at these shows.\n\nVideo link for Reed Mathis & Electric Beethoven \u2014 https://youtu.be/7c3stv0sGD8\n\nThe show at the World Caf\u00e9 Live will start at 8 p.m. Tickets are $15 in advance and $18 at the door.\n\nWhile many, many theater fans and patrons of the arts in the Delaware Valley for years have enjoyed and appreciated Theatre Exile (1340 South 13th Street, Philadelphia, 215-218-4022, theatreexile.org.), the small theater in South Philadelphia still could be considered one of the city\u2019s \u201chidden gems.\u201d\n\nFounded in 1996 by Joe Canuso and Trish Kelly, Theatre Exile was created by a group of artists who wanted to follow different paths than the mainstream. Drawn to plays that explore the complexities of the human condition and contain a sense of true Philadelphia grit and passion, Exile has produced 64 full-scale productions, including 18 world premieres and 31 Philadelphia premieres.\n\nIt was the first Philadelphia organization to produce such noted playwrights as Pulitzer Prize and Tony winner Tracy Letts, Noah Haidle, Rona Munro, David Harrower, Annie Baker, Rajiv Joseph, Mike Bartlett, Sharr White and Lucas Hnath. Theatre Exile has received 87 Barrymore Award nominations, with 19 awards total.\n\nNow, Theatre Exile is continuing its 20th anniversary season with the Philadelphia premiere of \u201cLost Girls\u201d from February 16-March 12 at its Studio X. This hard-hitting drama is the story of three generations of women who struggle to rise above their limited prospects, in a world indifferent to their struggles, to prevent history from repeating itself.\n\nThe show is directed by Exile\u2019s Founding Artistic Director Joe Canuso and features an ensemble cast with Catharine Slusar, Trevor William Fayle, Sean Bradley, Molly Ward, Amy Frear and Susanne Collins.\n\n\u201cWe have a cast of six and it really is an ensemble piece,\u201d said Ward, during a phone interview Tuesday afternoon during a break between tech and a dress rehearsal. \u201cMy character is Maggie and it is more from her perspective.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s set in the present time in Manchester, New Hampshire. It\u2019s about one family \u2013 a blue collar New Hampshire family dealing with a missing teenage daughter during a blizzard.\u201d\n\nFilled with poignant passions, plot twists and dark humor, \u201cLost Girls\u201d is both a tense family drama and a moving teenage love story. When Erica, their 16-year-old daughter, goes missing during a winter storm, Maggie and Lou\u2014former high school sweethearts, now divorced\u2014are forced to confront the legacy of their past decisions.\n\n\u201cWhen Erica is lost, we all come together at my mother\u2019s house \u2013 my ex Lou. His wife Penny, my mother Linda and me,\u201d said Ward. \u201cWe are dealing with the fact that we might have lost her.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a non-traditional family having to deal with each other. My mother is a fantastic comic matriarch \u2013 played by the fantastic Catharine Slusar. She is my grumpy, drunk mom and she\u2019s a force to be reckoned with.\n\n\u201cShe was a single mom and so am I. We\u2019re two generations of unwed mothers. The show is about the struggle not to repeat mistakes our parents made. It\u2019s a nice story about a family \u2013 about people trying to do the best they can.\u201d\n\nThe play was written by John Pollono, an American playwright who also penned award-winning \u201cSmall Engine Repair.\u201d The show is directed by Exile\u2019s Founding Artistic Director Joe Canuso.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know anything about \u2018Lost Girls,\u2019 when I auditioned,\u201d said Ward, a native of Mount Airy who just relocated to Philly after living in New York for 20 years. It was in New York right when I was leaving New York.\n\n\u201cI read it and it\u2019s a meaty actor\u2019s play. It\u2019s an old-fashioned family play that is also dark and funny. It\u2019s really plot-driven \u2014 and it flies by. It\u2019s extremely well-paced. The script is a tight machine.\u201d\n\nVideo link for Theatre Exile \u2014 https://youtu.be/evMxZpD9myE.\n\n\u201cLost Girls\u201d will run from February 22-March 12 at Theatre Exile. Tickets range from $10-$40.\n\nThe 2017 Mardi Gras season has already started in New Orleans. The Krewes are out in force and the parades have begun all over town.\n\nFortunately, area music fans don\u2019t have to travel all the way to the Big Easy to get in a Mardi Gras mood and groove to the sounds of New Orleans because the Ardmore Music Hall (23 East Lancaster Avenue, Ardmore, 610-649-8389, www.ardmoremusic.com) is hosting the New Orleans Suspects on February 17.\n\nThe New Orleans Suspects have only been in existence for slightly more than seven years but they are so tight musically, it would be easy to assume that they\u2019ve been making music together for decades.\n\nThe band features Charlie Wooton on bass (Royal Southern Brotherhood, Sonny Landreth, Bonerama), \u201cMean\u201d Willie Green on drums (Neville Brothers), Jeff Watkins on saxophone (James Brown Band, Joss Stone Band), Jake Eckert on guitar and vocals (Dirty Dozen Brass Band) and CR Gruver on keyboards and vocals (Polytoxic, Outformation).\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re still home,\u201d said Eckert, during a phone interview last week from his home in New Orleans. \u201cOur gear heads out tomorrow and we fly to New York City on Thursday. We\u2019ll do a short tour and then head home for Mardi Gras.\n\n\u201cBeing home for Mardi Gras is very important to us. The carnival festivities kicked of last weekend and it just keeps ramping up. It lasts three weeks and each week gets progressively more intense. It\u2019s a full family tradition. The kids even have off from school the last week before Mardi Gras.\u201d\n\nThe band\u2019s formation was very accidental. Hank Staples, the guy who runs the Maple Leaf (a popular New Orleans music club) occasionally had a band that doesn\u2019t show up. So, he kept a list of New Orleans musicians who he could call at the last minute.\n\n\u201cWe all live right around the Maple Leaf,\u201d said Eckert \u201cI was in the Dirty Dozen Brass Band. Willie was with the Nevilles and the Radiators were still in existence.\n\n\u201cHank would call me whenever he needed a band at the last minute. We played a couple gigs together and people really enjoyed it. A few weeks later, Hank called again. Another few weeks later, he called again and said \u2014 can you put the usual suspects together to come play?\u201d\n\nThe band began performing a couple times a month at the Maple Leaf and started hanging out at Eckert\u2019s place while he was building his studio. Before long, they were developing their own sound.\n\nIt was a traditional sound within the realm of New Orleans funk \u2014 music like the early Meters, Earl King, Mardi Gras music, Professor Longhair, Dr. John and early Neville Brothers. Eckert also brought along a background in southern rock.\n\n\u201cAs time went on, we started recording our first album \u2014 first as a demo and then it turned into a real album,\u201d said Eckert. \u201cThat\u2019s when we changed our name to the New Orleans Suspects. Then, we started hitting the road.\n\n\u201cThe next crossroad was when we picked up Jeff Watkins. He\u2019s a great saxophone player as well as an amazing engineer. He was the missing link.\u201d\n\nWatkins and Eckert produced and engineered the band\u2019s latest album \u201cOuroboros.\u201d They also did the mastering at Eckert\u2019s studio, which won a Grammy two years ago for its work with the North African band Tinariwen.\n\nAccording to the band\u2019s press release \u2013\u201cOuroboros,\u201d the band\u2019s third album, features fever-inducing funk, irresistible R&B rhythms, Longhair rhumbas, dancing-in-the-street second lines, jazzy soul-drenched horns, mind-melting swamp hoodoo, and feet-don\u2019t-fail-me-now Carnivale music.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re working on our new album now,\u201d said Eckert. \u201cThe last one and this one are all originals. There is zydeco, straight-up New Orleans funk, Southern rock, Second Line tunes, a Mardi Gras Indian song and a song we made with Paul Barrere and Fred Tackett of Little Feat.\n\n\u201cThe music has changed. At first, it was all these different styles come together. Now, it has its own sound. It\u2019s a strange gumbo but the sum of the parts is really good.\u201d\n\nThe Mardi Gras vibe will be in full force at the Ardmore Music Hall Friday night with sets by Bonerama and the New Orleans Suspects.\n\n\u201cI love Mardi Gras,\u201d said Eckert. \u201cI\u2019ve got a seven-year-old and it\u2019s great for kids. What you see on TV with girls flashing their breasts on Bourbon Street and what actually happens are very different. Bourbon Street is for tourists.\n\n\u201cUptown, where all the bands are from, it\u2019s a family thing with colors, costumes and cotton candy. We\u2019ll probably go to 10-12 parades. We\u2019ll be playing at the Maple Leaf for Lundi Gras (February 27, the Monday before Mardi Gras). That\u2019s still our home base.\u201d\n\nVideo link for New Orleans Suspects \u2014 https://youtu.be/PQvHN49Vgks\n\nThe show at Ardmore, which also features Bonerama, will start at 8 p.m. Tickets are $\n\nOther upcoming shows at Ardmore are Antibalas and Fresh Cut Orchestra on February 16, Splintered Sunlight on February 18, Maceo Parker with special guest Muscle Tough on February 19 and Paul Barrere & Fred Tackett from Little Feat with special guest Lupe Garu on February 22.\n\nFred Eaglesmith, who will headline a show on February 17 at the Steel City Coffee House (203 Bridge Street, Phoenixville, 610-933-4043, www.steelcitycoffeehouse.com), has been singing songs and playing music for a long time.\n\nHe has been performing in the states and around the world for more than 42 years. Eaglesmith released his debut album \u201cFred Eaglesmith\u201d in 1980 and just released his latest album \u201cStandard\u201d on January 27.\n\nHis bio offers this quick recap of his career as one of North America\u2019s premier songwriters \u2013 \u201cStart writing songs when you\u2019re 10 years old. Grow up with poverty, agriculture, religion, and eight siblings. Run away from home. Hop freight trains. Start a business. Lose a business. Struggle to get any gig. Drive to Nashville with no money and pockets full of songs. Get a record deal. Lose a record deal. Win a Juno Award. Break down on the side of the road every day for days on end. Become a cult hero and amass a following of self-proclaimed \u201cFred Heads.\u201d Tour relentlessly. Become everyone\u2019s favorite. Becomes nobody\u2019s favorite. Follow your gut. Smarten up. Don\u2019t care what anybody thinks. Be fair. Be loyal no matter what. Keep going. Soften up. Give people a break. Expect nothing. Give everything. Keep going. Allow yourself to be happy. Find out who you are and deal with that. Don\u2019t stay in fancy hotels. Write good songs.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve made 21 or 22 albums in 37 years,\u201d said Eaglesmith, during a phone interview Monday afternoon from a tour stop in Virginia.\u201cI had a vision when I was a kid that the career I\u2019m having was what would happen.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, I did have sort of an idea that it would work out that way \u2013 me being an underground artist that gets some respect. At age 60. I\u2019m very alive and vibrant \u2013 very on fire with a lot of creativity. I\u2019m still on the road 200 days a year \u2013 and I\u2019m still an alternative thinker.\u201d\n\nEaglesmith is a veteran of the music industry and at the same time is about as far away from actually participating in today\u2019s music industry as one could be. Never operating within anyone\u2019s boundaries, he continues to set the standard for independent artists everywhere.\n\nHe tours endlessly \u2013 performing with his wife and musical partner Tif Ginn.\n\nGinn is a gutsy singer and a transcendent songwriter who has spent most of her life touring and playing music. Her impressive, sultry vocals and glorious harmonies with Eaglesmith, along with her multiple instrument additions to the show, result in a perfect partnership.\n\nEaglesmith\u2019s new album \u201cStandard\u201d shows that he is as on target as ever.\n\n\u201cI put the material together over a long time,\u201d said Eaglesmith.\n\n\u201cI get ideas and then try to get them to work. We cut the album at my home studio. We recorded it analog \u2013 and used a lot of tape.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t trying to find a theme. I just wanted to create something of interest. It has a loose feel but it was a very hard album to record. It came out pretty simple but it was a very difficult record to make \u2013 to make it believable. It wasn\u2019t perfect in an era of perfect records.\u201d\n\nAccording to Eaglesmith, \u201cThe album is more narrative than musical. The vocals have not been re-tuned, either automatically or manually and sometimes they are a little sharp or flat. On some of the tracks you can hear the quiet hiss of reel-to reel-tape. It is a less than perfect album.\u201d\n\nEaglesmith was well aware that many musicians sacrifice reality for perfection when making records \u2013 and that it was a path he did not want to follow.\n\n\u201cThese days, you can fix everything but that\u2019s not what I wanted,\u201d said Eaglesmith. \u201cIt\u2019s a hard decision because audiences are used to perfection.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to decide what to leave in and what to take out. I make pretty lo-fi records regularly. Anybody can make hi-fi records. These guys were singing these songs \u2013 and they were real.\u201d\n\nVideo link for Fred Eaglesmith \u2013 https://youtu.be/8C2re3oG1y8?list=PL133D1F7173ECCD8A.\n\nThe show at Steel City\n\nTickets are $25 in advance and $28 day of show.

        "body0": "A recent blog post of the National Book Critics Circle asked members \u201cat this time of cultural shift\u201d in the dawning era of Donald Trump to identify their \u201cfavorite work of resistance literature.\u201d The writer Paul Wilner identified John Steinbeck\u2019s \u201cquietly furious\u201d strike novel In Dubious Battle as his personal choice.\n\n\u201cWe may not see the future lying before us,\u201d Wilner explained, \u201cbut Steinbeck has provided a valuable road map to the lessons of the past. He may have fought kicking and screaming against the label of \u2018engaged\u2019 writer\u2013he\u2019ll never be confused with Sartre, to his credit\u2013but he understood the power, as well as the perils, of resistance.\u201d\n\nTrue enough, but my choice of road map for resisting Donald Trump would be The Moon Is Down, the play-novella John Steinbeck wrote during the early, dark days of World War II about anti-fascist resistance by the citizens of a Nazi-occupied country in northern Europe. Steinbeck\u2019s little book inspired citizen resistance in Nazi-occupied territories from the Baltic to the Black Sea. It contains practical advice for Americans opposed to Donald Trump\u2019s attitudes and actions as president, 75 years after it was written.\n\nSet in a fictionalized version of Norway, The Moon Is Down tells the story of what residents do when alien soldiers \u2014 never named as Nazis, but unmistakable nonetheless \u2014 invade their peaceful coastal mining town by air, land, and sea. Hitler\u2019s forces tried hard to suppress The Moon Is Down in Nazi-occupied lands (possession was punishable by death in Mussolini\u2019s Italy), but contraband copies, printed and passed on by hand, were widely credited with sustaining anti-fascist resistance until Nazi occupation ended in 1945. Once World War II was over, John Steinbeck was awarded the Freedom Cross by King Haakon VII of Norway, that nation\u2019s highest civilian honor.\n\nMagnified by an unforgiving winter, the passive bitterness of an occupied people morphs into active rebellion that begins quietly when the town\u2019s mayor refuses to drink with the army officer who \u2014 unlike Donald Trump \u2014 is a moral man following orders from others. The refusal to cooperate eventually costs the mayor his life, but not before his example inspires numerous acts of rebellion, some violent, by residents of the town.\n\nSanctuary-city mayors around the United States are setting a similar example by signaling their refusal to cooperate with federal orders to round up undocumented residents for deportation. Demonstrations at legislative town hall meetings, by citizens concerned about health care, are following a similar pattern. People are standing up to power.\n\nWhen civil rights leader and U.S. Representative John Lewis was interviewed on Meet the Press not long ago, he prepared the stage for official resistance by explaining to Chuck Todd why he felt Donald Trump was \u201cnot legitimate\u201d and why he refused to attend Trump\u2019s inauguration. \u201cYou cannot be at home with something that is wrong,\u201d Lewis told Todd, citing the example of Martin Luther King Jr., who said, \u201cWe must learn that passively to accept an unjust system is to cooperate with that system, and thereby to become a participant in its evil.\u201d\n\nJohn Steinbeck understood this principle but professed to be surprised that The Moon Is Down proved so popular, explaining that he wrote the book \u201cas a kind of celebration of the durability of democracy.\u201d When the mayor in Steinbeck\u2019s story says that he feels the will of the people and acts accordingly, he gives unspoken permission for their resistance, the ultimate result of which is left \u2014 in typical Steinbeck fashion \u2014 for readers to decide. As Steinbeck makes clear, however, the occupiers are flummoxed because they fail to understand the psychology of people brought together by crisis. Products of a top-down, authoritarian culture familiar to students of Donald Trump, they are unprepared for popular resistance and cannot cope when confronted with democratic dissent.\n\nAs Steinbeck\u2019s mayor explains to the puzzled commandant who is trying to keep order, \u201cFree men cannot start a war, but once it is started, they can fight on in defeat. Herd men, followers of a leader cannot do that, and so it is always the herd men who win battles and the free men who win wars.\u201d John Steinbeck\u2019s advice couldn\u2019t be clearer: Once a bully picks a fight, resist. You may lose the battle, but you\u2019ll eventually win the war.\n\nStephen Cooper is a former D.C. public defender who worked as an assistant federal public defender in Alabama between 2012 and 2015, now living in Woodland Hills.

        "body2": "James Franco\u2019s screen adaptation of John Steinbeck\u2019s 1936 novel, \u201cIn Dubious Battle,\u201d about striking California fruit pickers, is the farthest thing imaginable from the titillating provocations for which Mr. Franco is notorious. Along with his films based on William Faulkner\u2019s \u201cAs I Lay Dying\u201d and \u201cThe Sound and the Fury,\u201d it belongs to the literary subgenre that might be called James Franco\u2019s eat-your-spinach movies.\n\nThe first novel in Steinbeck\u2019s Dust Bowl trilogy, which also includes \u201cOf Mice and Men\u201d and \u201cThe Grapes of Wrath,\u201d \u201cIn Dubious Battle\u201d is Mr. Franco\u2019s stodgiest movie: a traditional historical drama replete with stale boilerplate dialogue and a choppy narration about the early days of the American labor movement. It was a time when striking workers risked brutal, sometimes murderous retaliation by greedy bosses and their rich cronies.\n\nVideo\n\nDirected by Mr. Franco from a screenplay by Matt Rager (who also wrote the script for Mr. Franco\u2019s \u201cThe Sound and the Fury\u201d), it stars Mr. Franco as Mac, a fiery union organizer who, with his much younger prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Jim Nolan (Nat Wolff), sets out to organize apple pickers in the fictional Torgas Valley of Central California.\n\nMac is fiercely idealistic but unscrupulous, and Jim a starry-eyed na\u00eff. Both belong to \u201cThe Party\u201d (read Communist). When the laborers learn that their promised pay has been reduced from $3 to $1 a day, they are ripe for the plucking as potential union members. Robert Duvall, with his usual aplomb, plays the evil landowner Bolton, who appears gun in hand with his posse.\n\nThe rebellious fruit pickers are soon feuding among themselves, and before long organized protest morphs into dissension, chaos, arson and death. The movie\u2019s latter half is a mess; pivotal characters aren\u2019t properly introduced, and the rusty dialogue clanks so heavily you feel you are watching a vintage made-for-television movie.\n\n\u201cIn Dubious Battle\u201d wants to be a noble period piece in the mode of a John Sayles film like \u201cMatewan.\u201d But it is too flat-footed and sloppy to explore the obvious parallels between then and now, and the movie is peppered with gratuitous star cameos that distract rather than enlighten. At least it means well.", 
        "body1": "A recent blog post of the National Book Critics Circle asked members \u201cat this time of cultural shift\u201d in the dawning era of Donald Trump to identify their \u201cfavorite work of resistance literature.\u201d The writer Paul Wilner identified John Steinbeck\u2019s \u201cquietly furious\u201d strike novel In Dubious Battle as his personal choice.\n\n\u201cWe may not see the future lying before us,\u201d Wilner explained, \u201cbut Steinbeck has provided a valuable road map to the lessons of the past. He may have fought kicking and screaming against the label of \u2018engaged\u2019 writer\u2013he\u2019ll never be confused with Sartre, to his credit\u2013but he understood the power, as well as the perils, of resistance.\u201d\n\nTrue enough, but my choice of road map for resisting Donald Trump would be The Moon Is Down, the play-novella John Steinbeck wrote during the early, dark days of World War II about anti-fascist resistance by the citizens of a Nazi-occupied country in northern Europe. Steinbeck\u2019s little book inspired citizen resistance in Nazi-occupied territories from the Baltic to the Black Sea. It contains practical advice for Americans opposed to Donald Trump\u2019s attitudes and actions as president, 75 years after it was written.\n\nSet in a fictionalized version of Norway, The Moon Is Down tells the story of what residents do when alien soldiers \u2014 never named as Nazis, but unmistakable nonetheless \u2014 invade their peaceful coastal mining town by air, land, and sea. Hitler\u2019s forces tried hard to suppress The Moon Is Down in Nazi-occupied lands (possession was punishable by death in Mussolini\u2019s Italy), but contraband copies, printed and passed on by hand, were widely credited with sustaining anti-fascist resistance until Nazi occupation ended in 1945. Once World War II was over, John Steinbeck was awarded the Freedom Cross by King Haakon VII of Norway, that nation\u2019s highest civilian honor.\n\nMagnified by an unforgiving winter, the passive bitterness of an occupied people morphs into active rebellion that begins quietly when the town\u2019s mayor refuses to drink with the army officer who \u2014 unlike Donald Trump \u2014 is a moral man following orders from others. The refusal to cooperate eventually costs the mayor his life, but not before his example inspires numerous acts of rebellion, some violent, by residents of the town.\n\nSanctuary-city mayors around the United States are setting a similar example by signaling their refusal to cooperate with federal orders to round up undocumented residents for deportation. Demonstrations at legislative town hall meetings, by citizens concerned about health care, are following a similar pattern. People are standing up to power.\n\nWhen civil rights leader and U.S. Representative John Lewis was interviewed on Meet the Press not long ago, he prepared the stage for official resistance by explaining to Chuck Todd why he felt Donald Trump was \u201cnot legitimate\u201d and why he refused to attend Trump\u2019s inauguration. \u201cYou cannot be at home with something that is wrong,\u201d Lewis told Todd, citing the example of Martin Luther King Jr., who said, \u201cWe must learn that passively to accept an unjust system is to cooperate with that system, and thereby to become a participant in its evil.\u201d\n\nJohn Steinbeck understood this principle but professed to be surprised that The Moon Is Down proved so popular, explaining that he wrote the book \u201cas a kind of celebration of the durability of democracy.\u201d When the mayor in Steinbeck\u2019s story says that he feels the will of the people and acts accordingly, he gives unspoken permission for their resistance, the ultimate result of which is left \u2014 in typical Steinbeck fashion \u2014 for readers to decide. As Steinbeck makes clear, however, the occupiers are flummoxed because they fail to understand the psychology of people brought together by crisis. Products of a top-down, authoritarian culture familiar to students of Donald Trump, they are unprepared for popular resistance and cannot cope when confronted with democratic dissent.\n\nAs Steinbeck\u2019s mayor explains to the puzzled commandant who is trying to keep order, \u201cFree men cannot start a war, but once it is started, they can fight on in defeat. Herd men, followers of a leader cannot do that, and so it is always the herd men who win battles and the free men who win wars.\u201d John Steinbeck\u2019s advice couldn\u2019t be clearer: Once a bully picks a fight, resist. You may lose the battle, but you\u2019ll eventually win the war.\n\nStephen Cooper is a former D.C. public defender who worked as an assistant federal public defender in Alabama between 2012 and 2015, now living in Woodland Hills.
